The term XR, which stands for eXtended Reality, covers VR, AR, and everything in between, constituting one of the few umbrella terms the industry seems to agree on. Everywhere you looked, the wearable face computer industry grew in 2025, and that all starts with VR.</p><p>Last year was pivotal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vr-market-2025-expectations-predictions">for big-name VR releases</a>, and while some of that continued into 2025 with titles like Deadpool VR, Alien: Rogue Incursion, Thief VR: Legacy of Shadows, and more, the real winners were the indies. That's because, for whatever reason, Meta Quest gamers seem to mainly gravitate toward smaller titles that get big word of mouth on social media.</p><p>Case in point is Animal Company, which garnered "over 1 billion views organically" on TikTok, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/discover/success-stories/animal-company-wooster-games/">Meta developer profile blog post</a>. That drove it to achieve the 5th-highest first-year revenue for a VR game, boasting over 1 million active monthly users and spawning a ton of clones. UG VR is another success story following the same mold of free-to-play titles with in-app DLC content.</p><p>The shift has made smaller teams happy, but it's also driven several companies out of business. Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-lay-offs-strike-again-impacting-its-reality-labs-division">laid off several employees</a> across its first-party VR development studios, and we also saw studio closures at established houses like Toast Interactive and WIMO Games. The silver lining here is that the Quest once again outsold most major consoles this Black Friday/Cyber Monday, according to publicly available info, a trend that's been a regular holiday tradition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-2-units-sold-spring-2022">for years now</a>.</p><p>All of this came to a head in early December when Meta decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reality-labs-budget-2026-quest-4">slice 30% of Reality Labs' budget</a> starting in January 2026, a move that had been a long time coming as the department's spending had grown out of control over the years, while other Meta departments have taken 10% year-over-year cuts since 2022.</p><p>While that sounds bad initially, it's paving the way for a better, leaner Meta Quest. Two lead product and UI designers from Apple joined Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-just-stole-two-of-apples-biggest-lead-designers-and-the-implications-for-vr-smart-glasses-and-ai-are-absolutely-enormous">in early December</a>, and word on the street is that they'll have a hand in redesigning the Quest UI and in making the Quest 4 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-meta-quest-4-rumors-lighter-headset-2025" target="_blank">an ultra-light, sleek,</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-meta-quest-4-rumors-lighter-headset-2025"> gaming-first headset</a>.</p><p>We're also seeing this shift because Meta <em>finally</em> has some real competition in the sector. Apple released a souped-up Vision Pro with a refreshed chipset and a more comfortable headstrap in August. Plus, Samsung finally launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Galaxy XR</a> headset alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SetF4VNw3S9CEAmxYCnS3E" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-meta-quest-3-split" alt="A Samsung Galaxy XR headset and a Meta Quest 3 headset in a split image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SetF4VNw3S9CEAmxYCnS3E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And to make things even better, we got to try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tried-google-samsung-ai-glasses-prototypes-before-android-show-xr-edition-heres-what-i-learned">Android XR running on Xreal's Project Aura</a> smart glasses, which are set to release in 2026. That's a full VR headset operating system on a pair of light and comfortable smart glasses, and it's going to be a massive game-changer next year.</p><p>To top things off, Valve even announced a new VR headset called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/steam-frame-steam-deck-meta-quest-3">Steam Frame</a>. Frame runs a new version of SteamOS that's capable of not only running Windows VR games on a mobile chipset, but also Android games natively, as well. It's expected to make big waves, you guessed it, in early 2026.</p><h2 id="the-year-smart-glasses-won-2">The year smart glasses won</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2701px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GKLCWXPfqN7SkSjAHnMSKf" name="Meta-2025-new-glasses" alt="Three Oakley Meta HSTN, three Oakley Meta Vanguard, and three Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), along with cases, sitting atop a table in various styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GKLCWXPfqN7SkSjAHnMSKf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2701" height="1519" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The VR industry has never seemed busier, but the smart glasses segment has never seen the success it had until 2025. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses were the inflection point the industry needed, and Meta doubled down on its efforts to rule this segment for years to come.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">ramped up production</a> of its glasses back in February, then released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/exclusive-metas-new-smart-glasses-are-great-and-everyone-should-be-worried">a bevy of new glasses</a> to glowing reviews in the fall. Ray-Ban Gen 2, Oakley Meta HSTN, Oakley Meta Vanguard, and Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses all made huge waves and likely even better sales, solidifying Meta as the de facto smart glasses company after years of spending billions on R&D.</p><p>But the real standout was Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses. These are the first consumer-ready pair of Meta's smart glasses with a display, and while they're expensive, they mark a pivotal point in the smart glasses race.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a38SZoLvnDfpFWCi4BVsRk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-navigation" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing turn-by-turn navigation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a38SZoLvnDfpFWCi4BVsRk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This was also the year we saw Google get serious about smart glasses again. We got our hands on Google and Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">prototype smart glasses</a> back in May, and a follow-up Android XR event in December <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tried-google-samsung-ai-glasses-prototypes-before-android-show-xr-edition-heres-what-i-learned">gave us even greater insight</a> into the company's big plans for 2026.</p><p>But that doesn't just mean AI glasses to compete with Ray-Ban and Oakley Meta smart glasses; it also means utilizing partnerships with existing smart glasses companies. Magic Leap smart glasses powered by Android XR <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/magic-leap-is-working-with-google-to-make-prototype-android-xr-glasses">were shown off in October</a> and will compete with Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-unveils-the-future-of-xr-new-features-for-galaxy-xr-and-upcoming-smartglasses-teased">Xreal Project Aura</a> is going straight for the throat with a full VR UI in a comfortable pair of smart glasses.</p><p>Speaking of Xreal, the company launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">best smart display glasses</a> we've seen to date all the way back in February, and the competition hasn't been able to keep up since.</p><p>Xreal One smart display glasses look similar to previous Xreal glasses from the outside, but they come packed with the first dedicated chipset for a pair like these, enabling spatial tracking for <em>any</em> device you plug them into. That's a game-changer because it means the virtual display looks and feels like a real display, anchored in physical space, no matter how you move.</p><p>Viture launched the Luma line, culminating in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/viture-luma-ultra-hands-on-and-limited-edition-cyberpunk-smart-glasses" target="_blank">the Luma Ultra</a>, and while they don't offer native spatial tracking like Xreal's glasses, they can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-smart-glasses-that-work-perfectly-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-and-all-your-favorite-systems">give your Switch 2 an OLED on the go</a> when paired with a Viture Pro Mobile Dock. And when paired with the Spacewalker mobile or PC apps, they can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-immersive-3d-video">turn any 2D video into 3D</a> using AI.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RtXmhdMnc5teiEQUyEzdxW" name="xreal-one-with-box-01" alt="A pair of Xreal One smart glasses on its retail box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RtXmhdMnc5teiEQUyEzdxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rokid launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rokids-new-ar-glasses-are-basically-a-laptop-you-wear-on-your-face">new AR glasses</a>, with a second, more powerful pair teased in September. And folks looking for an affordable pair of smart display glasses can finally pick up $250 RayNeo models <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/air-3s-pro-rayneo-best-xr-glasses-are-true-game-changer">that don't feel like a compromise</a>.</p><p>The wearable computer segment has taken a bit longer to "get good" than most tech pundits would have liked. But 2025 has proven that good things take time, and XR wearables are definitely getting really, really good.</p><h2 id="the-best-year-since-2020-2">The best year since 2020</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5871px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="HbBt8fvQ3zAUoPQLuaPpNh" name="Aura_3_TAS_XR_ Nov 06 2025_110 (1)" alt="Google shows off Project Aura XReal glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:0,cw:5871,ch:3302,q:80/HbBt8fvQ3zAUoPQLuaPpNh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5871" height="3914" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The last time we saw this level of interest and excitement in VR (and XR as a whole) was back in 2020, when COVID kept everyone home, and the Oculus Quest 2 revolutionized VR gaming. While a significant number of announcements toward the latter half of the year won't materialize until early 2026, none of those products are vaporware, and they represent significant improvements in Meta's competition.</p><p>But it was also the year Meta continued to solidify its dominance across VR and smart glasses. The company has spent more than any other in this category, and it shows. Thankfully, that stranglehold on the market hasn't produced poor products. Rather, Meta's consistency has spurred competition, even in companies like Google, which we were <em>very sure</em> would never launch another pair of smart glasses or VR headsets until Android XR was announced.</p><p>If you're a VR enthusiast, exciting times are ahead as Meta, Valve, Apple, and Google aim to push the boundaries of what we've come to expect from standalone hardware. And anyone looking for a great pair of smart glasses already has several to choose from, with the proper killer pair of AR glasses (Xreal Project Aura) seemingly just around the corner.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Vivo is doing all the right things in the mid-range with devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-v50-proves-that-iterative-updates-can-still-be-fun">V50</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-v60-has-proven-to-be-a-terrific-mid-range-phone">V60</a>, and the foldable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">X Fold 5</a> continues to hold its own against the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><h2 id="oppo-a-2">OPPO: A</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rQGgbSmQaxzyjoJEbUgcjh" name="Best of 2025" alt="Find X9 Pro and Find X9 next to Find X8 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rQGgbSmQaxzyjoJEbUgcjh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OPPO also had a standout year, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a> is an outstanding device — it is my daily driver, and I don't see myself switching to another device for another month at least. The brand is once again selling phones in Western markets, and that is a positive move.</p><p>I like what OPPO is doing with foldables as well; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a> launched nearly a year ago, but it continues to be great. The only area where the brand needs to do better is wearables; it makes decent smartwatches, but they're somehow still limited to China — I'd like to see these debut in more markets around the world.</p><h2 id="huawei-a-2">Huawei: A</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="A8UsyLTh3DAFfTYZsyBU2i" name="Best of 2025" alt="Huawei Mate XT next to the Mate X7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A8UsyLTh3DAFfTYZsyBU2i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Huawei just isn't letting the trade ban get in the way of delivering outstanding phones. The Mate XT is the most innovative phone I've used, and the tri-folding device is incredible. The Pura 80 Ultra has one of the best zoom lenses around, and the all-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei/huawei-mate-x7-preview-camera-testing-design-battery">Mate X7</a> takes foldable cameras to new heights. While Huawei's software efforts are still lagging behind industry standards, it's clearly leading in hardware design.</p><p>I also like how Huawei is building a broader ecosystem. The Watch Ultimate 2 is my favorite smartwatch, the 12-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/huawei-12-2-matepad-pro-is-the-tablet-upgrade-you-want">MatePad Pro</a> is the best Android tablet I've ever used, and the brand rolled out several standout earbuds this year. And with recent devices like the Mate X7 offering the ability to install MicroG during initial setup, it's easier than ever to get Google services installed on Huawei's phones.</p><h2 id="poco-b-2">POCO: B</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FRhx3vQWPGT8VGhqMbpKih" name="Best of 2025" alt="POCO F8 Ultra next to F7 Ultra and F7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FRhx3vQWPGT8VGhqMbpKih.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, I can't fault what POCO did this year. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f7-ultra-review">F7 Ultra</a> showcased the brand's imaging efforts, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x7-pro-review" target="_blank">X7 Pro </a>proved to be a great budget phone, and the F7 held its own against rivals. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f8-ultra-review">F8 Ultra</a>, the brand has a legitimate rival to what Vivo and other brands offer in the $700 segment.</p><p>POCO needs to do better in India, its biggest overseas market. By not bringing the F8 Ultra to India, it is ceding ground to Realme. Outside of that, the software needs an overhaul, but that's more on Xiaomi than POCO.</p><h2 id="realme-b-2">Realme: B</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="o7CVGRknbEKr3Qss4HKath" name="Best of 2025" alt="Realme GT 8 Pro Dream Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o7CVGRknbEKr3Qss4HKath.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I started paying more attention to Realme again in 2025, and I like what the brand is doing. As an F1 enthusiast, it's exciting to see the brand partner with the Aston Martin F1 team, and the GT 7 Pro and GT 8 Pro Dream Edition devices are terrific. I'm excited about the Ricoh collaboration as well; as other Chinese brands have demonstrated over the years, there's plenty of benefit to be gained from partnering with a camera giant, and I'm keen to see where that takes Realme.</p><p>If anything, it looks like Realme is now the brand that gets all the limited edition models within the BBK umbrella. This used to be OnePlus' specialty, but that's no longer the case in 2025, as evidenced by the Realme 15 Pro Game of Thrones edition.</p><h2 id="honor-c-2">Honor: C</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Rv6PNfBcCxx5FcY7LxPFth" name="Best of 2025" alt="Honor Magic V5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rv6PNfBcCxx5FcY7LxPFth.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor continues to make good phones, but its software efforts lag behind its rivals. I'm not talking about update policy — Honor is in line with Samsung and Google when it comes to flagship updates — but the state of the UI itself. While Honor has been saying that its software is made entirely in-house, it still has vestiges of EMUI, and it's just not cohesive.</p><p>While Honor phones have decent cameras, the inconsistencies are becoming evident, and phones like the Magic 8 Pro aren't as good as the Vivo X300 Pro or the Find X9 Pro. Honor itself says it doesn't want to be highlighted to its Chinese brethren, instead inviting comparisons to Google and Samsung. Given Honor's struggles with its cameras and their inability to measure up to OPPO and Vivo, it's no surprise the company is unwilling to pit itself against the best the industry has to offer.</p><h2 id="xiaomi-c-2">Xiaomi: C</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5fw7hUMiKDmFWXiJMWTofh" name="Best of 2025" alt="Xiaomi's best phones of 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fw7hUMiKDmFWXiJMWTofh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xiaomi needs a reset — that much is clear from its product positioning and strategy. The Xiaomi 15 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">15 Ultra</a> were strong launches, and I liked using the 15T and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-15t-pro-review">15T Pro</a>. However, the Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus was underwhelming (yet again), Xiaomi isn't doing anything to address long-standing software issues, and it doesn't have a coherent vision around what it wants to do with its ecosystem globally.</p><p>Then there's the delay with the Xiaomi 17. While its immediate rivals debuted their flagships globally — the Vivo X300 Pro and Find X9 Pro are available in India and the U.K. — there's no sign of the Xiaomi 17, Xiaomi 17 Pro, or the Pro Max. Xiaomi isn't bringing these devices outside China, and that lack of consistency is hurting the manufacturer.</p><h2 id="asus-d-2">ASUS: D</h2><p>I want to like ASUS's devices, but the Taiwanese brand just doesn't make it easy. This year's phones have been great (as always), but an obstinate stance on software updates — where its phones will only get two platform updates — basically killed any interest in its phones. Combined with the likes of Redmagic getting its act together and delivering better software, and I just don't see the point of ASUS when its devices just don't provide a good value.</p><h2 id="oneplus-f-2">OnePlus: F</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi" name="Best of 2025" alt="OnePlus phone launches 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Where do I even start with OnePlus? There was a time when the company could do no wrong. In 2025, it felt like it got everything wrong. The OnePlus 15 turned out to be a massive letdown, with the phone being a downgrade from the OnePlus 13, and the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-review">OnePlus 15R</a> is even worse — the phone doesn't even have a telephoto lens, and it costs $699. Even its Nord devices have been mid at best this year.</p><p>The way I see it, OPPO no longer sees value in OnePlus, and it's entirely possible it is just running out the clock on the brand. All the interesting bits to do with OnePlus — the Hasselblad partnership, unique limited edition devices, and fun software — have been integrated into other brands anyway.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-performance-reportedly-jumps-after-android-16-qpr2-update">latest Android QPR2</a> update reportedly brought big <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-performance-reportedly-jumps-after-android-16-qpr2-update">performance improvements to the Pixel 10</a> series, in addition to new features. Among the new feature additions is Expanded dark mode, which has been introduced as a new accessibility feature.</p><p>Toggling this mode lets you force dark mode in apps that don't natively support it. This is great news for fans of dark mode or for anyone that hates being blinded by light backgrounds when they fire up their apps at night.</p><p>This feature is currently rolling out for all Pixel phones that are compatible with the Android 16 QPR2 update. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr2/get">Supported Pixels</a> include the Pixel 6 and later devices. To check if you're on the right build, head to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>About phone</strong>, and scroll to the last entry called <strong>Build number</strong> which should say <strong>BP4A.251205.006</strong>.

In my experience, it seems to work decently well on apps that would otherwise not switch to a dark theme even if the system did. There could be instances though where forcing a dark theme could break the user experience and make navigation of an app worse.</p><p>While this is great as a temporary workaround, app developers should ideally plan on integrating a native dark theme for the best user experience, if they haven't already.

We've seen slow improvements as more people have become aware of this problem, but this year was the most successful year yet for genuine progress.</p><p>In August, Google launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-new-pwm-accessibility-setting">a new accessibility feature</a> that doubled the display's PWM rate.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">Pixel 10</a> is also the first major Android phone series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">to feature MagSafe/Qi2 magnets inside</a>.</p><p>This also marked the year of thin phones, or so Apple and Samsung thought.

Both Samsung and Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">have reportedly already canceled</a> the follow-ups, but maybe something else will do better next time.</p><h2 id="ai-takes-over-2">AI takes over</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wcfgixuhygHpE7MCm7BS8G" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-39" alt="Pixel Journal AI insight on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wcfgixuhygHpE7MCm7BS8G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Every company adopted major AI platform features this year.

We've got wider availability of models from companies, including important new additions to the U.S. market from companies like Nothing and Fairphone, strengthening competition in a year when fears over tariffs thought we'd see the opposite.</p><p>The situation in Canada is much better than in the U.S. overall, though. Canadians can buy all the best Chinese phones, which means they have full access to the <em>very</em> best Android phones. U.S. customers can technically buy them through third-party sellers on sites like eBay, but those phones are often more expensive and come with no warranty, making them a no-sale for most people.</p><p>If I had to grade the U.S. by itself, I'd give it a C- because of the absurdity of our carrier infrastructure and the government's arbitrary restrictions, but Canada's market brings North America's score up by a solid grade point overall.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In fact, unless you're looking at a dirt-cheap MVNO, <em>most </em>promotions offered by wireless providers are going to involve some eligibility requirements. The question is whether the potential savings are worth the hassle.</p><p>Case in point: just in time for the holidays, T-Mobile is running a deal that gets you a free Google Pixel 10 AND a free pair of Google Pixel Buds 2A earbuds. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10"><strong>All you need to do is add a line on the Experience More or Experience Beyond plan and you'll get $799.99 in promo credits over 24 months.</strong></a> That's enough to cover the full price of the phone, while the Pixel Buds appear as an instant discount when you add both items to your cart. There's also some trade-in credit up for grabs if you'd rather go that route.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a81e2241-20fc-4aca-9e07-ff0793793481" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 128GB: $799.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 128GB: $799.99" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="P2VuWjwLCiqD338ULfskKe" name="Google-Pixel-10-render-Indigo-front-back" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P2VuWjwLCiqD338ULfskKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 128GB: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10" data-dimension112="a81e2241-20fc-4aca-9e07-ff0793793481" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 128GB: $799.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 128GB: $799.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$799.99</del><strong> FREE with eligible line, plus free Pixel Buds 2A at T-Mobile</strong></a></p><p>Head to T-Mobile and add a line with the Experience More or Experience Beyond plan and the carrier will hook you up with enough promo credits to make the Google Pixel 10 totally free.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung played it safe with the Galaxy S25, but if we're being honest, it ended up being a pretty compelling Android phone. I would've liked to see a more aggressive design revamp, better cameras, and improved battery and charging technology. Even without those improvements, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> held its own as one of the best phones on the market in 2025.</p><p>I'm expecting big things from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a>, although rumors and leaks suggest it might be a letdown. Samsung is following the launch of the iPhone 17 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Google Pixel 10</a>, which included trend-setting upgrades like higher base storage and magnetic charging support. To be competitive, Samsung needs to match these additions and more.</p><p>These are the five upgrades I want to see from Samsung's Galaxy S26.</p><h2 id="an-even-slimmer-and-lighter-design-with-qi2-2">An even slimmer and lighter design with Qi2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7fg4XpamVwGs2Q64g8i9r7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-7" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7fg4XpamVwGs2Q64g8i9r7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I praised the Galaxy S25's design for retaining a thin, light, and compact footprint, noting that it was the "last compact Android flagship," but I didn't know it might be the <em>very last</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">small Android flagship</a>. Samsung is rumored to ship the Galaxy S26 with a slightly larger screen next year.</p><p>One thing I consistently loved about the Galaxy S25 throughout my year of testing was how great it felt in the hand. I eventually switched to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> for its thin feel, but the base Galaxy S25 is actually much more compact. At just 7.2mm thick and weighing only 162 grams with a 6.2-inch screen, the Galaxy S25 is incredibly pocketable and easy to hold.</p><p>For the Galaxy S26, I want to see Samsung prioritize keeping this in-hand feel intact while revamping the design. Following the introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Qi2 on the Google Pixel 10</a>, magnetic charging is officially an essential feature for any Android flagship that wants to be taken seriously. However, Samsung should leverage its R&D might to challenge itself to add <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/wpc-announces-qi2-25w-major-android-devices-certification-new-standard">Qi2</a> (and potentially a larger screen) while minimizing changes to the Galaxy S25's footprint, thickness, and weight.</p><p>Increasing the screen-to-body ratio and shrinking bezels are ways of getting more out of the same chassis. If Samsung can add a long-overdue Qi2 magnetic charging feature while still keeping the Galaxy S26 feeling small, it'll have an edge over Pixels in 2026.</p><h2 id="intuitive-ai-features-2">Intuitive AI features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-3" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's AI suite is underrated, in part because of its strong relationship with Google, which brings Google AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a> to Samsung handsets, and I need to see more of that in 2026. Circle to Search and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">multimodal Gemini Live</a>, which arrived on Galaxy phones first, are the types of groundbreaking software features I want to debut alongside the Galaxy S26.</p><p>With the Galaxy S25, the company's AI upgrades were a bit underwhelming. One year later, I still haven't found game-changing use cases for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a>. Meanwhile, Google is cooking up excellent Pixel 10 exclusives like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-cue-on-the-pixel-10">Magic Cue</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-use-camera-coach">Camera Coach</a>. Samsung should go back to the drawing board and perhaps call up Google to think big for the Galaxy S26's software upgrades.</p><h2 id="a-completely-revamped-camera-system-2">A completely revamped camera system</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XrdrGj8MCdv4ASiiGP4GfK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-8" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XrdrGj8MCdv4ASiiGP4GfK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If I had to describe the Galaxy S25's camera system in one word, it's non-competitive. The hardware can be traced back to the Galaxy S22 series, and if Samsung doesn't <em>significantly</em> upgrade the entire system for the Galaxy S26, it might be dead on arrival. At a time when Google, Apple, and OnePlus are making camera hardware tweaks on a yearly basis, Samsung risks falling even further behind if it doesn't make aggressive changes.</p><p>A camera system riding on a 50MP primary sensor, a 12MP ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view, and a 12MP 3x telephoto lens feels substandard heading into 2026. The primary camera sensor is fine, but for a flagship, two middling secondary cameras aren't good enough. In particular, the 3x optical zoom capability sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-camera-review">Pixel 10's 5x telephoto lens</a>.</p><p>I'd also like to see Samsung pay more attention to its computational photography and color science — perhaps even more so than the hardware. Samsung phones tend to produce photos that can look dull compared to those from a Pixel or an iPhone. I don't want Galaxy cameras to go too far and oversaturate, but finding a better middle ground would help the Galaxy S26 shoot better photos without any hardware changes.</p><h2 id="more-base-storage-with-no-price-hike-2">More base storage (with no price hike)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hn8GRZomrhbxLDNov8YUS7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-12" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hn8GRZomrhbxLDNov8YUS7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Too often, Samsung is reactionary. We all know it's capable of making great phones — just look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> — but its best work usually comes after it's challenged. One way Samsung can make its mark <em>proactively</em> on the Galaxy S26 is by shipping it with 256GB of base storage.</p><p>Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5-things-android-should-steal-from-apple-iphone-17-event">made waves with the iPhone 17</a> by making 256GB standard without hiking the price. Samsung should do the exact same thing, giving it an edge over the Pixel 10. Not only does the Pixel 10 start with 128GB of storage, but it uses UFS 3.1 flash, unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-ufs-40-storage-and-why-should-you-care">UFS 4.0</a> you get with the higher-priced 256GB variant. Give us 256GB UFS 4.0 storage without raising the Galaxy S26's price, and Samsung will immediately gain some goodwill with tech enthusiasts.</p><h2 id="better-efficiency-battery-life-2">Better efficiency + battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="562KYDM4rWPqGktqWiNnUF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-17" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/562KYDM4rWPqGktqWiNnUF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Really, the one thing Samsung doesn't have to touch on the Galaxy S25 is the phone's processor. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> is good enough, and although we're expecting an upgrade to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>, the Galaxy S26 will be fast either way. Rather than higher benchmark scores or faster gaming performance, I'd rather see Samsung focus on keeping temperatures down and improving the Galaxy S26's efficiency.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 only has a 4,000 mAh battery. With a power-hungry processor and display, the Galaxy S26 needs to find a way to bump battery life one way or another. It could do this by increasing capacity, improving efficiency, or delivering faster charging speeds to make midday power-ups easier.</p><p>But while these are my biggests asks, let us know in the comments what you hope to see in the Galaxy S26, which is expected to launch in just a couple of months!</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you want to find out whether a video is real or generated with AI, it can be tricky to do so. There are varying online tools that can try to spot AI-generated content, but Google is building an "imperceptible" watermarking technology called SynthID to help users tell if something is real or fake.</p><p>Starting now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> can verify the authenticity of videos using SynthID in the Gemini app. This video checker can reveal if uploaded content was created or edited with Google AI in any way. Google says over 20 billion pieces of AI-generated content have been watermarked using SynthID, which digitally watermarks Google AI creations from Veo generations to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-will-soon-watermark-magic-editor-creations-with-synthid">AI edits in Google Photos</a>.</p><p>To use the feature, upload a video to the Gemini app and ask a question like "was this generated using Google AI?" Then, Gemini will scan the video and respond with its findings, which include specifics as to what parts of the content (if any) were created or modified with AI.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hzkG07u8ITU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Gemini might respond with something like "SynthID detected within the audio between 10-20 secs. No SynthID detected in the visuals," according to Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/verify-google-ai-videos-gemini-app/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>The video verification feature does arrive with a few limitations. To upload a video for identification in the Gemini app, it must be 100MB or smaller and 90 seconds long or shorter. Additionally, this feature can only spot videos created with Google AI tools using the SynthID watermark — it won't uncover details about content generated with third-party software.</p><p>The new addition to the Gemini app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/your-android-phone-is-getting-a-new-ai-detector-for-photos">follows SynthID photo verification</a>, which debuted in November.</p><p>"SynthID adds an invisible digital watermark to an AI-generated image (or video segment)," Google explains on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/models/synthid/" target="_blank">DeepMind website</a>. "The watermark doesn’t change the image or video quality. It’s added the moment content is created, and designed to stand up to modifications like cropping, adding filters, changing frame rates, or lossy compression."</p><p>Now, Gemini users can quickly and easily check the authenticity of photos and videos in the Gemini app everywhere it's available.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is probably the last quarterly platform update before Android 17, and while it doesn’t bring big changes, it’s designed to make daily use easier for Pixel users.</p><p>Quarterly Platform Releases, or QPRs, help Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/decembers-google-update-boosts-pixel-security-and-fixes-33-bugs">improve Android between major updates</a>. Rather than waiting for a yearly upgrade, these updates add small improvements, new features, and background fixes.</p><p>Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1ppctyi/android_16_qpr3_beta_1_now_available/" target="_blank">now available</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a> from the Pixel 6 up to the newest models through the Android Beta Program. The stable version is expected to arrive around March 2026.</p><p>On the surface, this beta focuses on usability tweaks that Pixel owners have been asking for. One of the most noticeable changes is flashlight control. Instead of a simple on-or-off toggle, you now get adjustable brightness, letting you dial the intensity up or down depending on the situation (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-qpr3-beta-1-features-3625332/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="JvHZSo8pjw9StxB5jkVXmn" name="Google-Pixel-10-At-a-Glance" alt="The At a Glance widget on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JvHZSo8pjw9StxB5jkVXmn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3410" height="1917" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The main highlight is the ability to remove the At a Glance widget from your home screen. In this beta, you’ll find a new "Show on home screen" option in the widget’s settings. Turn it off, and the widget disappears, giving you more space to organize apps, add widgets, or simply enjoy your wallpaper.</p><p>Navigation is now more flexible, as Google lets users reverse the order of the classic three-button navigation keys. This will feel familiar to anyone who has used Samsung phones.</p><h2 id="see-which-app-is-tracking-you-2">See which app is tracking you</h2><p>Privacy and transparency are improved as well. Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1 adds an expandable location indicator in the status bar, so you can easily see which app is using your location. Tapping it gives you more details, instead of just showing a generic icon.</p><p>The update also includes support for over 160 new emoji from Unicode 17.0, helping to modernize the platform in a subtle way.</p><p>Of course, this is still beta software. Bugs, battery quirks, and performance hiccups are part of the deal, and opting in means you’re committing until the stable release lands, unless you’re willing to wipe your device.</p> ]]></dc:content>

By uploading source material or discovering suggested content, users can create notebooks in NotebookLM. From there, that source material can be transformed in a variety of ways, like Audio and Video Overviews or flashcards and quizzes. Starting today, there's a new way to organize data in NotebookLM called Data Tables.</p><p>Data Tables are "clean, structured tables" that organizes data from your sources into simple visuals. These tables can be exported to Google Sheets for further editing and data management. Data Tables are positioned towards students, knowledge workers, scientific researchers, and general consumers.</p><p>Google suggests a few ways to use Data Tables in NotebookLM in the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-data-tables/" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing the new feature:</p><ul><li>Turn meeting transcripts into a clean table of action items, categorized by owner and priority. Or build a competitor comparison table analyzing pricing and strategies.</li><li>Synthesize clinical trial outcomes across multiple papers to track study years, sample sizes and statistics.</li><li>Prepare for exams with study tables of historical events, organized by date, key figures, and consequences.</li><li>Plan your dream vacation by comparing destinations, best times to visit and estimated costs.</li></ul><p>NotebookLM source material could include videos, websites, or long PDF files, for example. This could make it difficult to manually pinpoint and extract data for use in tables. With NotebookLM's new feature, AI will do the hard work for you in creating simple and helpful Data Tables.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="APVEkP8t5t3EYaE6W9aK54" name="Notebook-LM-Data-Tables-1" alt="The data tables feature in NotebookLM." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/APVEkP8t5t3EYaE6W9aK54.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google has been steadily adding new features to NotebookLM.

The Exynos 2600 is the world's first smartphone chipset built on a 2nm GAA (Gate-All-Around) process, and Samsung is claiming big gains in performance, efficiency, and thermals thanks to the new manufacturing node.</p><p>For reference, all current flagship chipsets from Qualcomm (including the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>), MediaTek, Apple, and even Google are built on a 3nm process, but Samsung appears to have beaten everyone to 2nm. In theory, the smaller the node, the better the overall performance and efficiency should be, although real-world results remain to be seen.</p><p>In terms of specs, the Exynos 2600 features a 10-core CPU built on Arm's latest v9.3 architecture. A notable change this time is that Samsung has entirely dropped low-power CPU cores in favor of a mix of high-performance and higher-clocked mid-tier cores.</p><p>The CPU includes one prime C1-Ultra core clocked at 3.8GHz, three high-performance C1-Pro cores running at 3.25GHz, and three efficiency-focused C1-Pro cores clocked at 2.75GHz. Samsung claims up to a 39% performance boost compared to the Exynos 2500, which powered the Galaxy S25 series in select regions.</p><h2 id="exynos-2600-might-finally-fix-samsung-s-heating-problem-2">Exynos 2600 might finally fix Samsung's heating problem</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jJU7U0ffNOs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Thanks to the upgraded CPU, Samsung says on-device AI performance should see a major improvement. This includes faster object detection in photos, improved image processing in the camera, and better overall video quality.</p><p>On the graphics side, the Exynos 2600 packs the new Xclipse 960 GPU, with Samsung claiming up to twice the performance of the previous generation and up to 50% better ray tracing performance.</p><p>One of the biggest issues with previous Exynos chipsets has been heat management, and Samsung appears to have focused heavily on this with the Exynos 2600. The company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/processor/mobile-processor/exynos-2600/">introduced</a> a new Heat Path Block, or HPB, designed specifically to improve heat dissipation efficiency.</p><p>Samsung says the HPB optimizes the heat transfer path, allowing heat to disperse more efficiently and enabling the chipset to sustain high performance during demanding tasks. By lowering thermal resistance, the new design helps move internal heat outward more quickly, keeping the SoC's temperature more stable.</p><p>The Exynos 2600 is expected to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-exynos-2600-chip-could-be-limited-to-just-one-country">power the Galaxy S26 series in select regions</a>, including Asia and Europe, likely for the base Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S26 Plus. While there were rumors that Samsung might use the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 across all regions, the official unveiling of the Exynos 2600 suggests Samsung will once again split chipsets depending on the market.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The At a Glance widget, the permanent fixture of date and weather information at the top of your Pixel home screen, is no longer a mandatory part of the experience.</p><p>If you’ve used a Pixel recently, you probably know how annoying it was to try to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-change-your-app-icon-theme-google-pixel">customize your home screen</a>, only to be stuck with the At a Glance widget. It took up space you might have wanted for something else and couldn’t be moved.</p><p>Now, you don’t have to struggle with your phone’s interface anymore. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> QPR3 Beta 1, Google is finally giving users a built-in way to take back control of their home screen (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2025/12/18/pixels-at-a-glance-can-finally-be-turned-off-in-latest-qpr3-beta/" target="_blank">Droid Life</a>).</p><p>The main news is a straightforward new toggle. In this beta, you can long-press the At a Glance widget, go to Settings, and see a new option called "Show on home screen."</p><p>Turning off this option removes the widget right away, freeing up that space for anything you like. Nevertheless, you can keep the feature on, so date and weather still show on your lock screen and Always-on Display.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.02%;"><img id="DK5KXe48xRfih36CuFub8Y" name="Turn-off-Pixel-At-a-Glance-widget" alt="a toggle to disable At a Glance from a Pixel's home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DK5KXe48xRfih36CuFub8Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1306" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Droid Life)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="new-utility-features-2">New utility features</h2><p>Additionally, this update adds more useful features than you might expect for a quarterly release. For example, the flashlight now has a brightness slider, according to a comment on Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1ppctyi/android_16_qpr3_beta_1_now_available/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a>. This allows you to dim the light for reading at night or make it brighter when you need more visibility.</p><p>If you’ve avoided switching to a Pixel because you’re used to other phones, this update helps with that too. Now, you can swap the navigation buttons to match the layout on Samsung devices, switching the Back and Recents keys to your liking.</p><p>Before you install this update, remember that it’s still in beta.

The recent beta shows that the company is working to solve a strong grievance users have with the Phone app: it can switch to landscape mode without warning. To solve this, it seems that Google will provide a "Controls" toggle in your phone's settings under "Display."</p><p>From there, the publication noticed that the toggle directly references the Phone app, stating, "Keep portrait mode on calls." The app's early description adds that enabling will "prevent accidental auto-rotation on calls."</p><p>If your phone did happen to rotate during a call, it would split into what nearly resembles a dual-view. The left side would house the other person's name and background (if applied), while the right side kept your call controls. It was a jarring switch that took users by surprise, especially one that Phone Arena cited in its post.</p><p>A user on Reddit asked, "How do I turn this off? Don't think there was ever a landscape mode for Google Phone (or dialer), but now it's doing it for me." They add, "Because when I hold the phone up and talk, it forces itself to landscape mode..." This creates an issue since users might not want to turn off the auto-rotation for their entire device, which is why Google is likely working on this subtle addition to avoid that small (but important) frustration.</p><h2 id="call-em-up-2">Call 'em up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qHshpn5qs4ELLiMrZFzLQG" name="google-phone-app-call-current-screen-hero" alt="Incoming call UI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qHshpn5qs4ELLiMrZFzLQG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nickolas Diaz/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's been working on refining its Phone app this year, after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-apps-simpler-layout-is-now-hitting-more-devices">a beta version from the summer</a> showcased its simpler layout. The layout ditched the old Favorites tab in favor of displaying who you frequently like to contact at the top of "Recents." It's quite a large UI refresh that piles those Favorites into a slim horizontal row right above the recent calls. Additionally, the dedicated "Frequents" list was also dropped, meaning you'll have to favorite those you call regularly.</p><p>A deep dive into the Phone app recently showed that Google is looking to make sure you people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-app-may-soon-make-your-urgent-calls-hard-to-ignore">don't miss those urgent calls</a>.</p><p>In the name of "urgency," users would be able to mark such calls with a tag that brings more awareness to calls from people you can't afford to miss. There was another feature discovered called "Expressive Calling." When calling someone, you can pick a "call reason," like “It’s urgent!” or “Quick question."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thankfully, the online workout program finally debuted in the country this week, and Apple is once again being strategic around the pricing. Fitness+ costs just ₹149 ($1.65) a month in the country, and a yearly plan is just ₹999 ($11), which is a sheer fraction of what it costs in the U.S. ($79) and U.K. (£79).</p><p>I tried plenty of online workout programs over the last four years: I started out with India's Cult Fit, and while it has a strong content library, it wasn't engaging. I then switched over to Les Mills, and it was much more to my liking, and it had a wide variety of bike-related workouts. I moved to Peloton as I got a new bike, and it was the program I used the most — even though it was the costliest by far.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="D4zRYypPqeEgFhfmuWZCWZ" name="Apple Fitness Plus" alt="Apple Fitness Plus launch in India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D4zRYypPqeEgFhfmuWZCWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All this time, I just wanted Fitness+ to be available in India. I wear an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch/i-used-the-apple-watch-series-10-for-six-months-heres-why-its-still-the-best-smartwatch">Apple Watch</a> daily, and I cast workouts to the TV or use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, and it's great to be able to use Apple's workout program. Fitness+ has a vast selection of guided programs, including HIIT, cycling, yoga, strength training, and meditation, and it integrates seamlessly with Apple products — obviously.</p><p>The biggest factor with an online training program is the energy of the presenter, and this is one of the reasons why I stuck with Peloton for close to a year. Thankfully, Fitness+ does a great job in this regard, and it has a diverse set of presenters alongside great production quality. There are no live classes, but that isn't a big limitation for me.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZpSdCiXc2xrWW8o64hbiMY" name="Apple Fitness Plus" alt="Apple Fitness Plus launch in India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZpSdCiXc2xrWW8o64hbiMY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, I'm enjoying just how easy it is to use — it's integrated into the Fitness app, and you can pause workouts with your watch. The affordability is a big selling point, and this is where Apple is doing all the right things; all new users get a free month of Fitness+, giving you the ideal opportunity to try out the program and see if suits your needs.</p><p>If anything, the introduction of Fitness+ in India shows just how far Google still needs to go. While Fitbit Premium has been available in India, it is without a doubt the weakest offering of any online training program, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-update-makes-the-fitbit-app-unusable">Google's constant efforts to hobble it</a> over the last two years have made it a non-starter.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="NQ8zCx5Jv3jfcY9ELvXrbY" name="Apple Fitness Plus" alt="Apple Fitness Plus launch in India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NQ8zCx5Jv3jfcY9ELvXrbY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even though Apple took its time to bring Fitness+ to India, the service isn't limited in any way in the country, and you can easily access the entire content library, download workouts, create a custom training plan, and all the features you get in the global version. The only thing left to do is actually use the service consistently.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While stealth's golden age is squarely in the mid-2000s with releases like Metal Gear Solid 3, several banger Splinter Cell games, and the Thief series (I would even argue Deus Ex fits in there too), a crop of new releases on the Meta Quest platform have given the genre the reinvigoration I've been hoping for.</p><p>Thief VR needs little introduction. It's the first mainline Thief entry in over a decade, and it's created by a pair of veteran VR developers in collaboration with the original developers and voice crew at Eidos Montreal. This time around, you play a new protagonist with the familiar voice of Garrett guiding your way.</p><p>Meanwhile, Espire MR Missions is the mixed reality follow-up to Espire 2, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games/2">best Meta Quest games</a>. This Metal Gear Solid-inspired game distills that classic formula to its core and uses the power of mixed reality to transform it into something wholly unique.</p><h2 id="the-return-of-the-thief-2">The return of the Thief</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OnfkhaSyeKU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow is my single-player VR game of the year. I had high hopes for it, given that Maze Theory and Vertigo Games were behind its development — two names you'll be familiar with if you play VR games — and the final product is basically what I'd hoped for.</p><p>Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review">Assassin's Creed Nexus VR</a>, Thief VR feels like a proper return to the series' roots while still maintaining the fresh feeling that a change of perspective can deliver. It's not trying to add a massive world to immerse players in, change up the gameplay, or turn it into a roguelike or some mixed-reality playground. It's just Thief, in first-person, with a new playable character, and with the immersive nature of physically moving around rather than sitting on a couch. You can even set your mic to "immersive mode," and the guards can hear you talk or make noise!</p><p>You can, of course, play while seated, but it still requires some movement and interactivity not afforded by a controller. Take, for instance, one of the many times I found myself behind a door with guards on the other side. I'd slightly open the door to get a quick peek, then plan my attack by using the door, effectively making it a moving wall.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nCTLMRPosJfjiUM3m8QzYC" name="thief-vr-screenshot-sneaking" alt="A screenshot of Thief VR on Meta Quest 3 showing you sneaking up behind a guard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nCTLMRPosJfjiUM3m8QzYC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vertigo Games)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This feeling never got old, and the game doesn't drag on for 60 hours or somesuch nonsense. Most players will finish it in around 8 hours, which, for me, is the perfect game length. I'm 40, have a family and a full-time job, plus plenty of other activities, friend circles, and the like. I don't have time for 900-hour games anymore, and even when I do play them, I often stop between the 20 and 40-hour marks because I get bored.</p><p>Because it's this length, the mechanics never wear out their welcome. Opening a window to crawl through feels brilliant every time. Bopping a guard on the head and dragging his body into the shadows is always harrowing and fun, especially when you play on hard difficulty. It's even fun to use the Mechanical Eye to mark guards or see how the gates are wired up to sabotage them, Deus Ex or Batman Arkham style.</p><p>Shooting one of the half dozen arrow types to knock out a guard, put out a fire, or even grapple to a specific shortcut is generally a lot of fun. I say generally because there's an unnecessary learning curve to the bow's mechanics. It just feels weird to aim, but it's something you adjust to by the end of the third level.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ff349d6e-ac94-46be-b7f5-6aeb02a1d1df" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest" data-dimension48="Meta Quest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:554px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="WkaqdfY59yhRAP4GyLKEsL" name="thief-vr-logo-square" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WkaqdfY59yhRAP4GyLKEsL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="554" height="554" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow</strong></p><p>Harken back to the days of yore when you played the role of a simple thief who gets roped into doing some good in the world and making a little extra coin along the way.</p><p><strong>Get it at</strong> <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/thief-vr-legacy-of-shadow/6429437293824115/" data-dimension112="ff349d6e-ac94-46be-b7f5-6aeb02a1d1df" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest" data-dimension48="Meta Quest" data-dimension25="">Meta Quest</a> | <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010853/">PlayStation</a> | <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800080/Thief_VR_Legacy_of_Shadow/">Steam</a></p></div><p>I found myself dreaming about Thief's levels more than once. Because of their immersive nature, VR games tend to cause this effect more often than traditional games, and it's always fascinating to experience. The game is even quite nice visually on the Quest 3, and I found that the gamma and environments were nicely tweaked to work best on the Quest 3's LCD, while the SteamVR version was just too dark.</p><p>If you're a fan of classic stealth games, Thief VR may just be the revival you've been looking for. I certainly know it was for me, and I count myself fortunate for having been able to finally experience another proper Thief series game again after such a long, long wait.</p><h2 id="there-s-a-solid-snake-in-my-house-2">There's a Solid Snake in my house</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yn5hsuQeKKA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Once I finished Thief VR, I was craving more stealth. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/laser-dance-meta-quest">Laser Dance</a> certainly fulfilled the Mission Impossible laser-dodging aspect of that, but I was still looking for a game that let me sneak around and take out bad guys, Metal Gear Solid style. That's where Espire MR Missions came in.</p><p>The Espire series is <em>pure</em> Metal Gear Solid through and through. I'd say it fits almost perfectly within Metal Gear Solid 2's mechanics, including multiple playable characters. But the MR missions are a little bit different. It still follows the same stealth concepts, but the difference is that the level is now your home.</p><p>That probably sounds boring to some of you, particularly if you don't have a spacious place. My home is on the small side, but I found Espire MR Mission's mixed-reality gameplay was enough to keep me from feeling confined to my living and dining rooms the entire time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.00%;"><img id="saNVM7Ve4Da3BCnPVNVtCh" name="espire-mr-missions-stealth-gameplay" alt="Stealth gameplay of Espire MR Missions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saNVM7Ve4Da3BCnPVNVtCh.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="200" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Digital Lode)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Espire MR Missions uses the home scan your Meta Quest headset performs before entering mixed reality space.

Walls often become bay doors to the Espire universe, with enemies lurking just outside your walls, ready to burst in if you alert them to your presence.</p><p>Like Laser Dance, you'll dodge plenty of lasers and have to solve several puzzles to complete missions or make progress in one. These all require you to physically move around your room, giving the game a physicality that most simply lack. There's no virtual movement here, and that changes everything.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="866f76a7-4c3d-4742-8ea2-14bb019dae04" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest" data-dimension48="Meta Quest" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="j8b4nbcqPvsNHY8M84Uhf" name="espire-mr-missions-logo" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j8b4nbcqPvsNHY8M84Uhf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="1024" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Espire MR Missions</strong></p><p>Step into a mixed reality battleground as your home is transformed into the ultimate stealth mission using the power of mixed reality technology.</p><p><strong>Get it at</strong> <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/espire-mr-missions/23942166455393686/" data-dimension112="866f76a7-4c3d-4742-8ea2-14bb019dae04" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Meta Quest" data-dimension48="Meta Quest" data-dimension25="">Meta Quest</a></p></div><p>Since the game shifts and morphs to fit your play space, you can take your Meta Quest 3 anywhere you want, and it'll feel like a brand new game every time. That doesn't have to mean a park or someone else's house, either. It can just be moving to a different set of rooms in your house.</p><p>Twenty-one of the game's 29 missions can be played in any size space, while the remaining eight require a specific size to complete. The game is just $8.99 for new players, and Espire 2 owners receive it totally free. Plus, since it's early access, development is still ongoing, which means you'll get more content over the next few months and years. Now that's a real win!</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now you can realize that <em>and </em>see it right on your smartwatch.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/android-bot/">announced this morning</a> that it's bringing its wacky Androidify feature to its Wear OS software. The Androidify app uses Gemini and Imagen to take your selfie and transform it into a green bot. Google states that users can personalize their Android bot on their phone and transfer the final product onto their watch face "in seconds."</p><p>Users can download the recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.developers.androidify">relaunched Androidify app</a> from the Play Store to get started. After snapping a selfie and putting on the final touches, Google encourages users to follow the on-screen steps to transfer that to their watch face.</p><p>This is all a part of the "Watch Face Push," an API that the company detailed for developers in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/12/bringing-androidify-to-wear-os-with.html">a blog post today</a> (Dec 18).  To further facilitate user engagement and customization, Google says developers can get involved with the necessary Watch Face Push resources. For the end-user, what's awaiting you is the "highly-personalized" Android bot in a place that your eyes may frequently venture throughout the day.</p><p>With its upgrades, the post states, "Androidify now has the ability to generate a watch face dynamically within the phone app" before sending it to your watch "in seconds." Users can refer to their watch after sending the new Androidify creation to their watch face and "allow" the app to make changes to apply what they made.</p><h2 id="android-bots-for-all-2">Android bots for all</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="UA8BLtwiurTFLunxEDcCee" name="google-wear-os-androidify-watch-face-update" alt="Users can download the Androidify app on their phone to create a personalized bot using their selfie and transfer that onto their watch for a unique watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UA8BLtwiurTFLunxEDcCee.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Androidify was a part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/androids-september-update-brings-music-sharing-and-personalized-android-bots">a major drop Google announced</a> in September.

In September, Google explained the process, stating that Gemini 2.5 Flash handled the prompt, while Imagen took over for the custom photo.</p><p>Veo 3 is even involved, as users can receive a short animation.

This deal is for the non-360 model, which doesn't have the 2-in-1 design, though it still packs a punch in a traditional laptop body that also includes a touchscreen display.</p><p>The lineup includes an upgraded CPU model from previous generations, a wide range of connectivity, and a slim, lightweight housing that makes it easy to transport. While the price tag is perhaps the largest deterrent to the Galaxy Book 5 Pro, $450 in savings definitely doesn't hurt if you were already considering a $1,000-plus laptop.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,649.99" data-dimension48="$1,649.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-book5-pro-copilot-pc-16-3k-amoled-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-ultra-7-16gb-memory-1tb-ssd-gray/J3ZYG2FVQ7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="knuaKq9UTCJKoDL2FwRi4D" name="samsung-galaxy-book-5-pro-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/knuaKq9UTCJKoDL2FwRi4D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-book5-pro-copilot-pc-16-3k-amoled-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-ultra-7-16gb-memory-1tb-ssd-gray/J3ZYG2FVQ7" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,649.99" data-dimension48="$1,649.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,649.99</del> <strong>$1,199.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Best Buy's holiday deals include $450 off the price of the Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro, which is a top-notch premium laptop.

The original poster (OP) noticed that a second update hit their Pixel 10 Pro XL this week. The report states that they are on Verizon's cell network. Shortly after posting, the user discovered that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/support/google-pixel-10-update/">Verizon had updated</a> their Pixel 10 software patch notes with this second update.</p><p>The security patch is roughly 25MB, per user reports on Reddit, fixing a pair of frustrating issues for users who experienced them.</p><p>Verizon states the update brings a fix for a severe battery drain issue plaguing the Pixel 10 series. Devices that were experiencing sharper battery drains than normal should find that rectified in the current patch marked BP4A.251205.006.E1. Another fix is rolling in for "touch unresponsiveness." The changelog adds that this regards "Intermittent touch failures observed specifically on Pixel 10."</p><p>The final fix is for cached content, such as offline media or maps, after upgrading from Android 14 to Android 16. Users on Reddit continue to report that they're seeing this update appear on their Pixel 10 Pro XL, as well as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.

Shortly after Google rolled out its monthly security patch, users quickly noticed that their displays were flickering when the AOD (always-on display) was enabled. This problem seemingly only affected Pixel 10 devices. Reports explained that the flickering would appear when wirelessly charging.</p><p>Additionally, users also noticed it when the clock refreshed (during AOD) and when unlocking their device. The flicker was quite brutal, as users stated their phone's display would go completely black before returning a second later.</p><p>This second patch doesn't state that Google has solved this issue, so maybe users encountering it still have to shy away from the AOD. That first security update arrived at the top of December, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/decembers-google-update-boosts-pixel-security-and-fixes-33-bugs">bringing 33 bug fixes in its sleigh</a>.

Per the publication, the email features a "unique code" that Premium subscribers can input for a whopping 40% discount on a Pixel 10 series phone. The service highlights that users can "enjoy all the videos and music" they love, which is just a nod to its own online content.</p><p>The code that YouTube Premium is dishing out is to be used on the Google Store when checking out with a Pixel 10 series model in your cart.</p><p>According to 9to5's diligent math, this discount would knock the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/theres-one-key-reason-the-pixel-10-pro-is-my-main-camera-for-work">Pixel 10 Pro XL's</a> price down from $1,199 to ~$770. There are likely taxes involved there for your place of residence, so keep that in mind. That's not all, as YouTube Premium's holiday wishes come with a warning: this deal won't last for long. Subscribers only have until December 31 to take advantage of this 40% discount on Pixel 10 phones.</p><p>That leaves us with a week and six days to get to it. Furthermore, 9to5 reports that not all subscribers are receiving this email yet. It also seems that YouTube is focusing on those who are truly subscribed, potentially leaving out those on a free trial or something similar.</p><h2 id="get-those-premium-perks-2">Get those Premium perks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1013px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.56%;"><img id="5Di5sAmiR49LCZw7QkwAYU" name="youtube-premium-pixel-10-2025-discounts-offered" alt="YouTube Premium is emailing subscribers a unique code for a 40% discount on Pixel 10 models until December 31, 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Di5sAmiR49LCZw7QkwAYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1013" height="502" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the only Pixel 10 series-related discount to float around this December.

The additional discount knocked the device down to $549 on the Google Play Store. This deal, while appealing, was only gifted to "select" Play Points members. Users are able to check their eligibility via the Play Store Perks tab.</p><p>Much like this YouTube Premium discount, users shouldn't wait if they're interested. The Play Store Points deal runs from December 15 to December 27, 2025 at 11:59 p.m. PT.</p><p>In other news, Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-offers-free-repairs-for-faulty-pixel-9-pro-models-amid-growing-user-complaints">working on some damage control</a> for consumers with a Pixel 9 Pro. Some consumers encountered faulty displays with the model, so Google is offering free repairs through its extended repair program. This covers devices three years post-purchase date to mitigate the frustrations users have faced.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Not only is this the lowest price these headphones have ever reached, but the price cut also brings them to under $250, a price range where they're super competitive amongst rivaling options.</p><p>To be sure, these are last-generation headphones, but between their price point being substantially lower than the Sony WH-1000XM6 model, and their powerful audio quality, they still hold up quite well. With the WH-1000XM5s, you'll get active noise cancellation, a long battery life, several onboard mics for optimal call quality, and a large set of speaker cups that most buyers love.</p><p>This deal is available in Black, Midnight Blue, or White, while they all include a powerful processing module for adaptive noise cancellation using the microphone suite. They also feature fast charging, touch controls, and easy customization via Sony's mobile app.</p><p>If you don't need the pricey upgrades included on the next-gen WH-1000XM6 headphones, these are a worthy contender for  the discounted price point, with multiple immersive listening modes, wear detection, an included case, and more.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5/dp/B0BXYCS74H" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="rdySiDNHum7Zj77MVRogz6" name="Sony-WH-1000XM5-render-with-space.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rdySiDNHum7Zj77MVRogz6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5/dp/B0BXYCS74H" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$399.99</del> <strong>$248.00 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Just ahead of the holidays, Amazon has slashed 38% off the price of our favorite <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a>, the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones.

First and foremost, even their normal price point is a little more doable for most than the newer WH-1000XM6s, while they still offer powerful, adaptive ANC, spatial audio, and easy touch controls that make them a pleasure to use.</p><p>Sony says these will offer up to 30 hours of playback time per charge, while fast charging via the USB-C port can refill up to 3 hours of battery life in just a 3-minute charge. They also include easy customization and EQ settings via the Sony Sound Connect app, as well as 360 Reality Audio, and seamless access to digital voice assistants like Siri and Google Assistant.</p><p>Honestly, it seems pretty hard to go wrong with these, especially at the current price point.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The new software version for Samsung smartphones brings features like a redesigned Quick Settings panel, updates to Quick Share, the ability to see all your files across all your devices, redesigned app icons, and more. And it may be gatekeeping some of it exclusively for its new Galaxy S26 series.</p><p>One of the new Galaxy AI features debuting with One UI 8.5 is the upgraded Photo Assist in the Gallery app, which allows you to apply AI edits to images without saving each iteration. It, however, appears Samsung is hiding even more Galaxy AI features within the build.</p><h2 id="ai-notification-summaries-may-remain-exclusive-to-galaxy-s26-at-first-2">AI notification summaries may remain exclusive to Galaxy S26 at first</h2><p>According to reliable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1999404746608939214">@chunvn8888 on X</a>, "lots" of One UI 8.5 features are not available right now because Samsung is keeping them exclusive to the Galaxy S26 series at launch.</p><p>One of the features the leaker mentions is the AI notification summary feature. This tool is reportedly part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-testing-smarter-notifications-one-ui-8-5-beta">One UI 8.5</a> but currently disabled. It will use Samsung's in-house Gauss model to provide users with a summary of their notifications from the past 24 hours.</p><p>The leaker adds that the feature will support several languages at launch including English, Korean, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Polish, simplified Chinese (中国大陆), Japanese, Hindi, Vietnamese, and Thai.</p><p>The feature will likely remain exclusive to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-accidentally-leaks-s26-design-one-ui-8-5">Galaxy S26 series</a> at first, with Samsung eventually rolling it out to other Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S25 series, Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and more later.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sTrPFUQTZp4La3Zcff3vnS" name="Google Pixel AI Summaries" alt="Google Pixel AI Summaries" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sTrPFUQTZp4La3Zcff3vnS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If this feature sounds familiar, that's because it is.

This year, though, it also offers a look at global health trends.</p><p>The company has released its 2025 Year in Review, and while it still highlights individual wins inside the Oura app, the bigger story comes from combining data from millions of users. Some countries are sleeping better, some are walking more, and some seem more stressed than you might expect.</p><p>If you’ve worn an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring</a> for at least 60 days this year, your personal Year in Review is ready in the app under the Today tab or in Reports under Yearly.</p><p>That covers your personal stats. The more interesting angle, though, is the anonymized global data pulled from millions of members between mid-November 2024 and mid-November 2025.</p><p>Let’s start with sleep. Oura’s data shows that New Zealand and Australia lead the way. New Zealand members had an average Sleep Score of 80, with Australia close behind at 79.4. Europe also did well, with Austria, Denmark, Sweden, the UK, and Czechia all scoring in the high 70s.</p><h2 id="women-win-most-metrics-but-stress-tells-a-different-story-2">Women win most metrics, but stress tells a different story</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="GVzKg7iM98vDBLsdkxdDg6" name="Oura-Ring-4-ceramic" alt="Oura Ring 4 ceramic collection is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GVzKg7iM98vDBLsdkxdDg6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oura also broke down performance by gender, and the results aren’t subtle. Women averaged 7.24 hours of sleep per night compared to 6.8 hours for men. They also posted higher Sleep Scores (79.2 vs. 76), stronger Activity Scores, and a slightly better Cardiovascular Age (CVA).</p><p>But there is a tradeoff. On average, women recorded about 30 more stressed minutes per day than men. This isn’t just emotional stress. Oura’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">Daytime Stress feature</a> tracks physical signs like heart rate changes and temperature shifts, which can rise after exercise, caffeine, or intense work.</p><h2 id="europe-walks-it-out-2">Europe walks it out</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3869px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bgTkov3rMyNkYEJqxPoqYh" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-07.jpg" alt="Holding the Oura Ring 4 between two fingers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgTkov3rMyNkYEJqxPoqYh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3869" height="2176" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For daily movement, Europe comes out on top. Ireland led with an average of 8,924 steps per day, followed by Spain and Italy. Oura points out that regular walking is one of the best predictors of better sleep, less anxiety, and improved heart health.</p><p>The most surprising data might be stress-related. The United States ranked first, averaging 121.2 stressed minutes per day, but it wasn’t alone. The Netherlands, Norway, Austria, and Canada all landed in the top five.</p><p>That’s striking, especially since many of these countries regularly score high on happiness and quality-of-life indexes.</p><p>If there’s one region that looks untouchable, it’s Scandinavia. Sweden posted the lowest average Cardiovascular Age at -2.8, indicating that members’ hearts appeared nearly three years younger than their actual age. Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Denmark followed closely.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's for the exhausted parents, disordered eaters, and indoor types who <em>want</em> to get healthier but struggle with it.<br><br>I'm not a natural athlete. I was a chubby kid with asthma who got healthier with high school sports, then spent years slowly regressing despite <em>trying</em> to stay active. It's only in the last couple of years that I've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds" target="_blank">shed a few dozen pounds</a> and become as fast as I was a decade ago.<br><br>I fully credit this to two things: Following the advice of my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness" target="_blank">fitness smartwatch</a> and sticking religiously to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-years-resolutions-2026-five-tricks-to-actually-achieve-them" target="_blank">New Year's resolutions</a>. I set achievable goals at the start of the year and <em>make</em> myself stick to them.<br><br>This Fitness 101 guide is designed to help my fellow strugglers who need to grit and claw their way to success. I've collected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-years-resolutions-starter-kit" target="_blank">Starter Kits</a> that'll help motivate you to hit your fitness goals, as well as our best fitness guides for the technology you can trust to be accurate (and affordable).<br><br>More personally, I've gathered some of my favorite testing articles from my weekly fitness column for hitting my goals, like when I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month" target="_blank">walked 10,000 steps every day</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/stand-alerts-will-save-your-life-but-most-watch-brands-get-them-wrong" target="_blank">stood up every hour</a>.</p><p>By the time Quitter's Day arrives in mid-January, I think more people can stick to their New Year's fitness resolutions if they have the right tech, plan, and mindset. I hope this guide helps you with that!</p><p><strong>- Michael Hicks, Senior Editor, Wearables</strong></p><h2 id="your-new-year-s-resolution-starter-kit-2">Your New Year's Resolution Starter Kit</h2>

According to the discovery, Google is preparing to introduce better satellite connectivity management for apps and mobile services. Rahman states that Google's code alludes to a "Satellite apps" addition to the overall satellite connectivity settings.</p><p>While the standard (already supported) apps are listed here, Rahman clocked other apps like X (formerly Twitter), Snapchat, AccuWeather, and Google Weather.</p><p>Elsewhere, Rahman noticed that the Android Canary build is preparing a "Satellite" Quick Settings tile. The tile seems to function similarly to your internet or Bluetooth tile; however, Rahman's test displayed "Satellite" as "not available." While that's not entirely strange, considering the method it was discovered, a deeper dive into the early code suggests that this tile is representative of your mobile plan's support.</p><p>Rahman claims that Google will bring similar UI behavior to its satellite apps list, too. For this, the company will heavily consider LTE or NB-based satellite plans. The post states that the latter isn't as adept at supporting the bandwidth for texting and voice. Development is still ongoing, so we might not see this arrive until a future Android drop.</p><h2 id="connected-in-the-dark-2">Connected in the dark</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:262px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:229.01%;"><img id="QcQNN5cASitzV7KcpWMm2J" name="android-satellite-quick-settings-tile-leak" alt="Leaks claim that Google is working on a "Satellite" quick settings menu tile for Android users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QcQNN5cASitzV7KcpWMm2J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="262" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no getting around the fact that cell service providers have been getting in on the satellite game, like T-Mobile when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile/t-mobile-adds-mms-texting-t-satellite-network-test-reported">launched its T-Satellite service</a> this summer.

These projects were meant to show that Horizon OS could work on more than just Meta’s own devices.</p><h2 id="asus-and-lenovo-are-left-hanging-2">ASUS and Lenovo are left hanging</h2><p>That plan is now said to be on ice. Meta has confirmed to Road to VR that the third-party Horizon OS program is paused, with no clear timeline for when or if it will resume.</p><p>Meta says it wants to concentrate on delivering “world-class first-party hardware and software" before expanding Horizon OS to outside manufacturers. In November, the company also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-gets-top-level-firepower-to-combat-android-xr">reshuffled its metaverse efforts into two divisions</a>, one focused on Horizon OS and another on the Metaverse Product Group.</p><p>Creating an XR operating system involves more than just adding software to different headsets. Horizon OS is closely connected to Meta’s hardware design, sensor setup, tracking systems, and performance goals.</p><p>Supporting devices from other companies means dealing with many different hardware options, which can make it harder to optimize, support developers, and provide updates over time. By stepping back, Meta is likely trying to avoid the fragmentation issues that have caused problems for other platforms before.</p><p>A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-delays-new-mixed-reality-glasses-code-named-phoenix-2025-12" target="_blank">report</a> suggests Meta’s own next major mixed-reality headset may not arrive until 2027, putting extra pressure on the company to get its software foundation right.</p><h2 id="competitive-pressure-2">Competitive pressure</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-5" alt="Android XR prototype glasses and Pixel smartphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/83zuR5C9JNo8wg767MHyo8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, competition is growing. Apple is promoting its tightly controlled Vision Pro system, while Google is laying the groundwork for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>. In that context, Meta may see more value in refining Horizon OS internally before letting partners ship devices that define the platform’s early reputation.</p><p>For ASUS and Lenovo, the pause means their work is unfinished and their plans are now uncertain. Their Horizon OS headsets are not officially canceled, but they are no longer moving ahead as expected.</p><p>If you were looking forward to seeing non-Meta headsets with Horizon OS soon, that won’t happen. For now, Horizon OS will stay closely linked to Meta’s own Quest devices.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-briefly-shows-up-in-us">A9 Plus launched last year</a>, but it still holds up for packing a serious punch despite the low price tag.</p><p>Faster-than-expected performance speeds are backed by the Snapdragon 695 5G processor and 4GB of RAM, while the device also boasts a decent 90Hz, 11-inch LCD display. The A9 Plus also includes Dolby Atmos quad speakers, and a microSD port for up to 1TB of expanded storage, along with 5MP front and 8MP rear cameras. The unit also includes a massive 7,040mAh battery, paired with fast charging that can quickly replenish battery life.</p><p>Users also like the large screen size for its use when multi-tasking, as the Galaxy device will also let users open multiple active windows at once. This combined with the discounted price point makes it a good pick for anyone in need of a cheap tablet option that will still offer plenty of functionality.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Where I do excel is nerding out over accessories and gadgets, spending hours poring over specifications, and getting into the semantics of why something is the right fit for a certain type of user. Thus, Michael and I are collaborating on this week's Gadget Weekly to recommend the best fitness accessories to meet your workout goals in 2026.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-years-resolutions-2026-five-tricks-to-actually-achieve-them">New Year's resolutions</a> don't just materialize out of thin air. Setting goals requires a certain level of commitment, and fitness goals in particular need consistent work. Thanks to wearables and other smart gear, it's a lot easier to keep yourself motivated, log your progress, and coach yourself.</p><p>But how do you know where to start? Here's what Michael has to say about that...</p><p>Buying fitness accessories to hit your goals is a double-edged sword. You're putting your money where your mouth is, giving yourself motivation to work hard and justify the money you spent. But if you don't stick with it, your gear will end up shoved in a closet, and you'll be back where you started.</p><p>I originally wrote a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-years-resolutions-starter-kit">New Year's resolution starter kit</a> for useful tech, accessories, and apparel, but I'm happy to help out Namerah and lay out some more accessories that I'd personally recommend and will help you get fitter, faster, and stronger in 2026!

The tipster's post alleges an interesting scenario going forward, as Samsung may chase a dual aperture return to combat Apple. According to DCS (machine-translated), Samsung is "testing wide-angle folding screens and variable apertures in preparation for the 2026 iPhone."</p><p>The picture is painted in a way that suggests Apple is looking to deliver a dual aperture feature for its iPhone next year, and Samsung wants that magic back.</p><p>Currently, the tipster's Weibo post didn't state how Samsung's dual aperture could look, nor did it say in which series it might arrive. However, as the publication speculates, Samsung could bring back wide and narrow apertures for varying situations, as it did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review">Galaxy S9 series</a>. What we've come to now, especially with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, is a digitally altered aperture. There's nothing in its hardware that alters the camera's aperture.</p><p>If Samsung brings this back, a future Galaxy phone could feel a little more like a traditional, powerful camera. Lenses for cameras can, for example, reach lows of f/1.8 aperture and highs of around f/16. Applications are simple, as you'd use low apertures for low-light and the higher option for extreme light (to handle it). SamMobile theorizes that Samsung <em>could </em>drop this for the Galaxy S27 series, but we're still well off from knowing for sure.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-looking-to-make-some-moves-2">Samsung's looking to make some moves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7wV9QXDsgbVHoqyV52RjTK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-9" alt="Camera modes on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7wV9QXDsgbVHoqyV52RjTK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite not having many camera changes, aside from an upgraded 50MP ultrawide lens, the Galaxy S25 Ultra still fared well in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">Android Central's head-to-head</a> (to-head-to-head). We placed the device up against three of the top devices: iPhone 16 Pro Max, Pixel 9 Pro, and the S24 Ultra to see how it performed in a camera battle.

We've seen Flash models from Google before, and Gemini 3's version is no different, except for its power capabilities. The post states Gemini 3 Flash's main takeaway is that it features "raw speed" to outperform what was delivered through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-2-5-pro-and-flash-go-public-as-google-announces-new-flash-lite-model">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>, with three times the quickness. Google states Gemini 3 Flash features the following pricing: $0.50/1M input tokens and $3/1M output tokens.</p><p>This speed is nothing without the artificial brains to back it up. Google claims the newest Flash model boasts PhD-level reasoning and "knowledge benchmarks like GPQA Diamond (90.4%) and Humanity’s Last Exam (33.7% without tools)."</p><p>More importantly, Gemini 3 Flash considers quality, as well as cost and speed, when thinking. Google says its AI model can "modulate" its thinking. While this may result in longer thinking times for "complex" tasks, Gemini 3 Flash still uses 30% fewer tokens than its hefty 2.5 Pro model.</p><p>The swift AI model also blazed through the MMMU Pro test, achieving high performance marks with a score of 81.2%.</p><h2 id="thinking-in-a-flash-2">Thinking in a Flash</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rPXBDSf-Hwg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Speedy intelligence arrives for developers, too, as Gemini 3 Flash can reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-pro-googles-new-ai-model-aims-to-redefine-multimodal-understanding">outpace Google's Gemini 3 Pro</a> and the 2.5 series with an SWE-bench Verified score of 78%. "Reasoning, tool use, and multimodal capabilities" were credited for the Flash model's prowess in complex video analysis.</p><p>Gemini 3 Flash is said to perform well for in-game assistants and A/B test experiments.</p><p>Google delivers another example, stating Gemini 3 Flash's enhanced multimodal capabilities can assist users in "seeing, hearing, and understanding" information quickly. Gemini can "understand" a video or image you've given it and create "useful" content from that understanding to further your agenda. Users can also create apps using your written prompt or voice without needing prior coding knowledge for something small and fun.</p><p>Gemini 3 Flash is available globally today (Dec 17) for everyone in the Gemini app. Google adds that this Flash model has become the "default model" in AI Mode for Search, too. Developers using the Gemini API can find 3 Flash in Google AI Studio, Gemini CLI, and Google Antigravity.</p><p>Enterprise users will see Gemini 3 Flash in Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Do you need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-amazon-kindle">tablet for reading books</a> or streaming TV shows? Do you need a powerhouse of performance for gaming or heavy file management? Answering this question first is crucial to deciding which tablet is right for you.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-best-cheap-android-tablet-2">What is the best cheap Android tablet?</h2><p>If I had to pick one tablet around 200 bucks (or less), it'd be the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus. Regularly discounted to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Android-Speakers-Upgraded-Graphite/dp/B0CLF3VPMV"><strong>around $199.99,</strong></a> this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablet</a> boasts a lightweight aluminum build with great battery life and a few premium specs you don't usually get in this price range, such as stereo speakers and a microSD card slot.</p><p>If you want to spend even less, it's worth mentioning that the Amazon Fire line of tablets offers great bang for the buck. The Amazon Fire HD 8, for instance, is currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Display-designed-portable-entertainment/dp/B0CVDS6WFQ"><strong>chilling at just 70 bucks</strong></a> during Amazon's holiday sale.</p><h2 id="can-i-use-a-tablet-instead-of-a-laptop-2">Can I use a tablet instead of a laptop?</h2><p>Definitely! Many of the best Android tablets deliver as much performance as a modern laptop, and it's an easy way to have a dual-purpose device that you can take with you wherever you go. You can even pair your new device with a keyboard case for the full laptop experience. The only catch is that you should expect to pay a pretty penny for models that offer laptop-level performance.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, the device that landed at my desk is closer to the 10R, which was so bland and forgettable I didn't even bother reviewing it.</p><p>The second issue is with the launch itself — who launches a phone a week ahead of Christmas? I was looking forward to just cranking out end-of-year posts and taking a well-deserved break, but OnePlus obviously had other ideas, so I'll do my best to keep this as short as possible.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R is billed as the affordable alternative to the OnePlus 15, and it comes with a same design, even bigger 7,400mAh battery, and has the same software. And as with the OnePlus 15, the 15R costs more while giving you less, with the device retailing for ₹47,999 ($531) in India and $699 in the U.S. — a $100 increase over the 13R. The 12GB/512GB model costs ₹52,999 ($586) in India and $799 in the U.S., and there's no 16GB RAM, as is increasingly becoming the case.</p><h2 id="oneplus-settled-with-the-15r-design-2">OnePlus settled with the 15R design</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KXa6gKFXHg4JKtMa9pQd6T" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KXa6gKFXHg4JKtMa9pQd6T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don't like the OnePlus 15, and I like the OnePlus 15R even less; the design just doesn't do it for me, and I feel that this is a downgrade to what was arguably one of the best phone designs of 2024. Look, I like that it doesn't wobble when I'm using it on a desk, and the new ultrasonic module is pretty good. But other than that, there isn't anything remotely exciting about the 15R, and it is about as interesting as a middle seat on a 16-hour flight (trust me).</p><p>It's almost as if the designers had a month at an exotic location design inspiration journey to come up with the look of the phone, had a whale of a time, realized on the last day that they didn't get any actual work done, and just stretched out the 13s to "create" a new device.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Nj2iccdBjHgqR59mM9rZ6T" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nj2iccdBjHgqR59mM9rZ6T.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Xn4qQsrJmjFLdFvPyxKGXT" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xn4qQsrJmjFLdFvPyxKGXT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="r6fA6TUETLdjmKndmMMZ4T" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6fA6TUETLdjmKndmMMZ4T.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The only fun thing with the design is an Electric Violet color variant, but in characteristic OnePlus fashion, it is limited to India. Now, I would've had something to talk about the design had I got that variant, but there just isn't much to say about the black model other than it's mundane.</p><p>Thankfully, the device gets the same IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance as the OnePlus 15, so you can use it outdoors without any worries. That said, the phone uses the custom Panda glass, and it isn't quite as resilient to tumbles as Corning's solution.</p><h2 id="cameras-you-ll-be-embarrassed-to-use-in-public-2">Cameras you'll be embarrassed to use in public </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZS8ks88Dxp57PZb9kCs4vS" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZS8ks88Dxp57PZb9kCs4vS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest issue is with the camera; the OnePlus 15R doesn't have a telephoto lens, instead offering a 50MP main camera and an 8MP wide-angle lens. Last year's OnePlus 13R came with a 50MP telephoto (which was actually good!), so you're basically getting a phone that's not even as good as its predecessor.</p><p>Obviously, this was something I asked the manufacturer in a product briefing, and I got a truly ridiculous answer: OnePlus says that its DetailMax imaging engine is so good that it didn't see the need to fit a dedicated telephoto lens on the 15R.

The OnePlus 15R has objectively worse cameras than the 13R, and the lack of a telephoto lens is egregious enough to be a deal-breaker. But hey, OnePlus says the 15R has the best selfie camera of any of its phones, using the same module as last year's OnePlus 13s.</p><p>The main camera itself is decent — it uses the same Sony IMX906 module as the OnePlus 15, and it does a good enough job in challenging situations. I don't have an issue with the main camera, but it is annoying to see OnePlus once again intentionally hobble the device by not including a tele lens.</p><h2 id="you-get-great-internals-and-the-same-old-foibles-2">You get great internals — and the same old foibles</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus put a 6.83-inch 1.5K LTPS AMOLED panel on the 15R, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-display-review">and it is very good</a>. It has standout colors, gets bright, and is easy on the eyes. It doesn't go down to 1Hz, and while it is billed as a 165Hz panel, it doesn't use the 144Hz or 165Hz modes outside of six games. In all other scenarios, you get the same 120Hz refresh as all other devices in this category.</p><p>It's annoying that most games are still limited to 60fps, and although OnePlus says it is focusing on gaming, I don't see that in real-world use. The phone does a good job while gaming, and the bigger panel is particularly good in this regard, but I would've liked to see it hit its full potential.</p><p>On that note, the device is powered by the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, and I'm just as confused as you are when it comes to Qualcomm's naming convention. It isn't clocked as high as this year's Elite variant, and you get pretty good performance — it is similar to that of last year's iQOO 13. OnePlus says it added a new 360-degree cooling system on the device, but it doesn't do much to curtail overheating.</p><p>Another new feature OnePlus added is a G2 Wi-Fi module, noting that it delivers better connectivity. Having used the phone, I didn't see a difference in connectivity versus other devices that use Qualcomm's built-in Wi-Fi modem, and I don't really understand why OnePlus even bothered.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="eT22gWcWqhXXFvWWPMvtST" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eT22gWcWqhXXFvWWPMvtST.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus indicated that the DRAM situation isn't going to cause any bottlenecks, but it's clear that it is affected seeing as how there's no 16GB model this time: both the 256GB and 512GB storage variants come with 12GB of RAM as standard.</p><p>There's no doubt that the battery is the best feature on the 15R. The 7,400mAh battery is even bigger than that on the regular model, and it lasts up to two days without issues. Even with heavy use, you can easily get it to last a day and a half, and it uses 80W charging tech. It isn't a silicon battery, and you get a single-cell design to maximize density, but the battery life itself is among the best in this category.</p><h2 id="don-t-buy-the-oneplus-15r-2">Don't buy the OnePlus 15R</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uwZ2aATG2DUJ64LSXaEZyS" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uwZ2aATG2DUJ64LSXaEZyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don't usually recommend older phones, but I will do so wholeheartedly here.

After years of complaints, Google is finally signaling that a fix is on the way, so Pixel owners may soon see the end of the dreaded pocket dialing.</p><p>This problem has been around for a while, which makes the upcoming change important. Since the Pixel 6, users have often reported their phones registering touches while locked and in their pockets.</p><p>Unlike some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> that rely on proximity sensors and motion data to suppress touch input when a phone is pocketed, Pixel devices never shipped with a true accidental touch prevention or pocket mode.</p><p>As time went on, frustration grew in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/wlolb8/pixel_6_pro_pocket_dialing_emergency_contacts/" target="_blank">Reddit threads</a> and Google’s issue tracker. Owners shared stories of their phones dialing contacts without warning or waking the screen just enough to register unwanted touches.</p><h2 id="the-problem-runs-deep-2">The problem runs deep</h2><p>For some, the most worrying part was accidental emergency dialing, an issue that’s not just annoying but potentially serious. Google has recognized the problem before, but real solutions never arrived, so users had to rely on workarounds like turning off gesture-based wake features and giving up convenience to avoid pocket mishaps.</p><p>Now, things are changing. A Google engineer recently updated the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/322569341#comment7" target="_blank">official issue tracker</a>, marked the accidental touch prevention bug as “fixed,” and told users to look out for future software updates (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/12/16/google-pixel-accidental-touch-prevention-fix-coming-future-update/" target="_blank">PiunikaWeb</a>).</p><p>While the company hasn’t announced the feature publicly or detailed how it works, this status change strongly suggests that Google has implemented a system-level solution that better detects when a Pixel is in a pocket or enclosed space and suppresses touch input accordingly.</p><p>This fix isn’t included in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/decembers-google-update-boosts-pixel-security-and-fixes-33-bugs">December Pixel update</a>, and it hasn’t been released quietly through a server-side change. Instead, it looks like it will arrive in a future Android update or Pixel Feature Drop, possibly in early 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>OnePlus debuted the R series in the U.S. earlier this year with the OnePlus 13R, and now the OnePlus 15R makes its entrance at the tail-end with massive upgrades in tow. It's not only the first phone to sport the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 processor, but also one of the few to feature a 165Hz refresh rate OLED. That, combined with the 3200Hz touch sampling rate, makes this a truly superb gaming phone.</p><p>Not only that, but the OnePlus 15R churns out top-tier brightness levels and excellent outdoor visibility, all without compromising on eye care features. It's the first OnePlus phone with a 3840Hz PWM dimming rate, helping make it the most eye-friendly OLED we've tested to date.</p><p>It's the premium OLED experience we didn't expect in a $699 phone, and it not only rivals phones twice its price in every regard but eclipses them in eye safety features. Read on to find out all the nitty-gritty details!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-eye-comfort-brightness-and-colors"><span>Eye comfort, brightness, and colors</span></h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LarGpve2oSg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The OnePlus 15R's display represents the best of the best in OLED tech. It's extraordinarily bright when it needs to be, impressively dim in a dark room, and dims without flickering, unlike Samsung and Google Pixel phones. In fact, this phone sets a new bar for OLED flicker-free tech.</p><p>OLEDs differ from technologies like LCDs because each pixel emits its own light, producing beautiful contrast. But OLEDs have to adjust brightness on every frame, making them prone to flicker. Some phones use an additional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> layer on top of this, worsening the effect and making it impossible for some people to use them.</p><p>But the OnePlus 15R's display sets a new bar for flicker-free OLEDs. It sports the lowest modulation I've ever seen from an OLED. Modulation is the percentage difference between the brightest and dimmest points during the refresh cycle. Lower is always better. Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a> have 99% modulation, meaning they fully turn off before turning on again. The OnePlus 15R's brightness dip (modulation) is as low as 3.89%. That's not a typo, and it's a substantial advantage for OnePlus.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="epteUrD9DMSzJ79gHtA7gT" name="oneplus-15r-pwm-graph" alt="Display flicker measurements from the OnePlus 15R using a 1/6400 shutter speed camera and an Opple Light Master IV light meter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/epteUrD9DMSzJ79gHtA7gT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15R uses DC dimming above 25% brightness and 3840Hz PWM dimming below that. Samsung and Google use a mere 480Hz rate, which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">been shown to cause health issues</a> in studies. Not only is 3840Hz well within the safe range deemed by the IEEE PAR 1789 standard, but it's also the fastest rate we've seen yet on a OnePlus phone.</p><p>To make things even better, the modulation rate during the PWM cycle is a record low of under 10%. I've <strong>never</strong> seen that on any phone, regardless of the price. It's a monumental win for OnePlus and the flicker-sensitive community, and great news for anyone who regularly uses this phone at low brightness.</p><p>It's also a <em>true</em> 10-bit panel, ensuring the phone doesn't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">temporal dithering</a> to fake colors and add yet another layer of flickering to the experience. Like PWM dimming, dithering can cause headaches, nausea, or other health issues.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pXsTBCsAALGjDL92Hfanme" name="sunlight-visibility-oled-01" alt="Testing the outdoor sunlight visibility of the OnePlus 15R compared to other smartphones from 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pXsTBCsAALGjDL92Hfanme.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nyLXZYui6NBsEQaWjxTene" name="sunlight-visibility-anti-glare-02" alt="Testing the outdoor sunlight visibility of the OnePlus 15R compared to other smartphones from 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nyLXZYui6NBsEQaWjxTene.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WwHkoz6VK9ggRv8zB3Wqme" name="sunlight-visibility-anti-glare-01" alt="Testing the outdoor sunlight visibility of the OnePlus 15R compared to other smartphones from 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwHkoz6VK9ggRv8zB3Wqme.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Despite having so many great eye care features, the OnePlus 15R still gets plenty bright when it needs to. Sunlight visibility was as good as any other phone I've ever tested, including those twice the price (or more).</p><p>OnePlus doesn't use any anti-glare layer on the display, but while the glass won't reduce glare, the display itself is more than bright enough to offset the reflections. One of the comparison images above compares it to several other ultra-bright OLED phones. In contrast, the other two images compare it to two popular phones that use matte or anti-glare displays.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gaming-refresh-rate-and-resolution"><span>Gaming, refresh rate, and resolution</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="5Yxvqxb3irwcB7NnPFEHaM" name="oneplus-15r-165hz-gaming-call-of-duty-mobile" alt="Playing Call of Duty Mobile at 165Hz on a OnePlus 15R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Yxvqxb3irwcB7NnPFEHaM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15R's display uses the same horizontal resolution as the OnePlus 15 — a maximum of 1272 pixels at the "high" resolution setting. That's almost identical to even more expensive phones like the Honor Magic 8 Pro (1256 pixels), but slightly lower than some phones like the Galaxy S25 Ultra (1440 pixels). Regardless, this is a 450 ppi display, and it's unlikely you'll ever notice a difference, especially if you're using the high-resolution option.</p><p>The slightly lower resolution enables OnePlus to push 165Hz in a select few games, including popular shooters like Call of Duty Mobile, PUBG, and Battlegrounds Mobile India. Just select 165FPS from the game's settings menu, and you'll be blown away by how smooth things are. Here's the full list:</p><ul><li>Call of Duty Mobile</li><li>Clash of Clans</li><li>Brawl Stars</li><li>Real Racing 3</li><li>Standoff 2</li><li>Blood Strike-FPS</li><li>Battlegrounds Mobile India</li><li>PUBG</li></ul><p>To make things better, the phone features the same 3200Hz dedicated touch-response chip as the more expensive OnePlus 15. That means games feel notably more responsive, even if they don't support the  165Hz display refresh mode.</p><p>Since this uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 processor, it has plenty of power to run games at that frame rate, too. By default, games that support 165Hz drop details a bit, but it's usually just down to medium, not low. I prefer resolution over frame rate any time, but 165Hz modes don't reduce resolution; they only increase object detail.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R uses an LTPS OLED panel that supports only a handful of refresh rates: 60Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz, 144Hz, and 165Hz. An LTPO display, like the one on the OnePlus 15, can dynamically adjust from 1 to 165Hz. LTPO certainly looks better on paper, but LTPS displays are generally better for people with flicker sensitivity. That's because the refresh rate mathematically aligns more closely with the dimming rate than on LTPO displays.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-verdict"><span>Verdict</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QMXdmeTpA3yp26CJ4vYMLR" name="oneplus-15r-green-back-pine" alt="Holding a mint green OnePlus 15R in front of a pine tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QMXdmeTpA3yp26CJ4vYMLR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm beyond impressed with the OLED display on the OnePlus 15R. It's not just the most flicker-free OLED I've <em>ever</em> tested; it also features the fastest refresh rate I've seen on a phone this side of a dedicated gaming phone (or a more expensive model like the OnePlus 15).</p><p>It does all that without sacrificing outdoor visibility or low-light comfort and gets closer to perfecting OLEDs as we know them. It's funny, because I was impressed by the OnePlus 15's display just a few weeks ago, and now the 15R — a $200 cheaper phone — matches those brightness metrics with even better eye comfort.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R is an LTPS display, which means the main refresh rates are 60Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz, 144Hz, and 165Hz. The OnePlus 15's LTPO display can drop as low as 1Hz, which could offer better power savings in some situations, but I'm not convinced this will make a difference for most people.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R also lacks the OnePlus 15's video enhancement modes, which can convert SDR content to HDR or even upscale lower-resolution content on the fly. While I don't care much about these two settings, they're notable and might be worth choosing the more expensive model if they're important to you.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b3d2e778-25b1-4363-9844-e1684f623f3d">            <a href="https://www.oneplus.com" data-model-name="OnePlus 15R" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WWn46A3fgC235XpWdn9h3o.jpg' alt="An official product render of the OnePlus 15R"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>OnePlus</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">15R</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The OnePlus 15R has one of the best OLED displays of all time, with a 165Hz refresh rate, excellent peak brightness and outdoor visibility, the lowest flicker rate of any OLED we've tested to date, and a true 10-bit panel without color dithering.

That's the case with Google Opal, an AI-powered tool for creating custom mini apps available as a Google Labs experiment. Starting today, the technology behind Opal is available directly in the Gemini web app.</p><p>It's an experimental Gem from Google that lets you build "reusable mini apps" and "unlock even more customized Gemini experiments," according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/mini-apps-opal-gemini-app-experiment/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. For those unfamiliar, Gems are custom AI chatbots that are experts at a specific task. You might use a Gem to take the role of a coach or a chess champion, for example. In this case, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-let-you-share-custom-gems-for-gemini-in-the-mobile-app">Gems</a> created with Opal in Gemini are mini apps with visual interfaces and complex functions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.28%;"><img id="xsrcTr4tG5qGZmoNMUtHsg" name="Google-Opal-Gemini-1" alt="Screenshots from Gemini's mini app builder." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xsrcTr4tG5qGZmoNMUtHsg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1882" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Opal debuted in July 2024 as a way to build AI mini apps by stringing together "actions" to create "workflows." It's a simplified version of app building that anyone can understand, and it supports text-based prompts, too. Unlike Google AI Studio or Google Antigravity, Opal is considered a "no-code" development platform that's accessible to everyone.</p><p>Opal is not-so-secretly powering the enhanced Gems in the Gemini web app. However,  the feature isn't being branded as Opal in the Gemini app. Instead, a new banner in the Gems tab reads: "Build AI apps, a new kind of Gem from Google Labs." This makes sense, because Google Opal doesn't have brand recognition among average Gemini users, since it's still only a Labs experiment.</p><p>To create a mini app Gem, users can pick a suggested prompt or type one in the text box. For guidance, the Gem creation chat window starts with "an app or workflow that..." to steer users in the right direction. You'll want to describe in detail what you want your AI mini app to do, and Gemini and Opal will try to make it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2494px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.70%;"><img id="b8Aas5DbqSo79Fh9J77PLh" name="Google-Opal-Gemini-" alt="Screenshots from Gemini's mini app builder." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8Aas5DbqSo79Fh9J77PLh.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2494" height="1888" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can view a miniaturized and collapsed version of Opal's visual editor in the sidebar after your app is created.

The feature allows users to start a chat in NotebookLM, close it, and pick up where they left off another time. Previously, NotebookLM notebooks would forget a conversation after each session ended, unlike Gemini, which supports Gemini and chat history.</p><p>NotebookLM is a research and study tool that can help you aggregate data and learn more about a topic. You can create Audio Overviews, Mind Maps, Reports, Flashcards, Video Overviews, Quizzes, Infographics, and Slide Decks based on source material. However, a simpler way to engage with NotebookLM is through the chat feature. It can answer questions about your topics using the context provided by your sources.</p><p>Now, chat history is available on NotebookLM's web client and in the iOS and Android apps. Google says that chat history can be deleted at any time. You can delete a chat's history by opening the notebook and clicking the three-button menu. This will reveal a <strong>Delete chat history</strong> button, which you can use at any time to clear your data.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2470px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.03%;"><img id="b4XeCxfWSKRHEAQDJVwKFD" name="NotebookLM-Chat-History-1" alt="Chat history in NotebookLM." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b4XeCxfWSKRHEAQDJVwKFD.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2470" height="1878" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For shared notebooks, Google reminds users that only you can see your chat history. All of your chat history is "retained and kept private to you." That is, until you manually delete it.</p><p>Previously, the only way to save your chats in NotebookLM was to save a response as a note. Below the NotebookLM chatbot's response, there is a <strong>Save to note</strong> button that will add the response as a note in your notebook. This method came with a few limitations — saved responses are view only, and don't include your written prompts. You can still save NotebookLM chat responses to notes, but now there's chat history available as an alternative.</p><p>A disclaimer in the Chat window in NotebookLM explained that chat history was only saved on the web, but mobile app support was coming "soon." As of Dec. 17, that disclaimer has been removed, and Google says the rollout is 100% complete for both the web and mobile apps.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Chat history is officially rolled out to 100% of users across mobile and web!

The company says that its budget-friendly phone still leans on its DetailMax Engine, which excels at capturing smaller details in photos. The OnePlus 15R is also capable of Ultra Clear Mode when shooting. The press release states this is activated automatically during the day and works to "double the resolution of your photos."</p><p>For selfies, the phone is equipped with a 32MP lens with strong focusing features. The device's recording function provides users with a crisp 4K resolution and extremely smooth 120fps.</p><p>Handling all of your daily functions and apps on the OnePlus 15R is a massive 7,400mAh battery. This battery outshines its flagship counterpart this year. More importantly, OnePlus states that this is its biggest battery it's ever made, which is estimated to have roughly 80% capacity remaining after four years of use. The device is paired with 55W SUPERVOOC charging.</p><h2 id="oxygenos-16-and-years-of-support-2">OxygenOS 16 and years of support</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:899px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.74%;"><img id="c5xr9NRnnZDfnVPkJkHKCn" name="oneplus-15r-eye-comfort" alt="The OnePlus 15R in its black option in the hands of a model inside a vehicle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c5xr9NRnnZDfnVPkJkHKCn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="899" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus AI is a major part of its OxygenOS 16 software on the 15R. Much like the flagship variant, users will find an upgraded Plus Mind experience with AI Recorder and AI Writer. The latter helps to summarize lengthy articles and create "visual mind maps from your notes." AI Recorder's transcription capabilities for interviews are said to "distinguish between speakers" for a more consistent summary.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/mind-space-app-in-oxygenos-16-bridges-oneplus-ai-with-gemini-for-inspiration">Plus Mind now looks to Google's Gemini</a> to help with weather forecasts and more, as the AI can dip into your saved Mind Space content for additional aid. OxygenOS 16 also retains its clean and smooth scrolling/interactions that you'd find on the company's flagship model.</p><p>OnePlus announces that the 15R will be supported with four years of OS upgrades, beginning with OxygenOS 16. This is strengthened by six years of security updates.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R is available in two RAM/storage configurations: 12/256GB and 12/512GB. The device starts at $699, as pre-orders begin on December 17 at 8:30 am ET on oneplus.com. Those looking to pre-order the device through Amazon must wait until January 8. Users will find the OnePlus 15R in Charcoal Black and Mint Breeze.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It did not take over the full screen and instead showed your wallpaper in a translucent view, with a pull-down swipe gesture at the top to quickly close the search screen.</p><p>However, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/16/pixel-launcher-search-google-app/">9to5Google</a>, Google has started replacing this with what it calls an "upgraded home screen search bar." This new search bar is actually the older Google Search UI powered by the Google app.</p><p>Now, when you tap the search bar on your Pixel's home screen, you're greeted with a new search interface that takes up the full screen and looks identical to the Google app's search UI. It's essentially the same experience you get on other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphones</a> when you tap the Google Search bar on the home screen.</p><h2 id="pixel-s-home-screen-search-now-opens-the-google-app-instead-2">Pixel's home screen search now opens the Google app instead</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HYvHhrFimNQCkTaSDnJJfT" name="google-pixel-launcher-search" alt="Old vs. New Pixel Launcher search UI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HYvHhrFimNQCkTaSDnJJfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Old vs. new Pixel Launcher search UI </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You still get access to app shortcuts, but you can no longer search for contacts or quickly access device settings like toggling Wi-Fi or Bluetooth from this screen. Because of this, it feels like a downgraded experience.</p><p>Google says this new search experience is part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-owners-get-a-whole-host-of-new-features-with-the-november-pixel-drop">November 2025 Feature Drop</a> that rolled out recently for Pixel devices. The reason behind this change, as many would've guessed, is faster access to AI.</p><p>Google says the new search makes it easier to jump into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-search-live-conversations-in-ai-mode-are-now-more-fluid-and-expressive">AI Mode</a>. According to the company, it "lets you quickly start and resume AI Mode journeys, so you can dig deeper on the web. You'll also see more suggested apps in the top row, making it seamless to continue exploring on your device."</p><p>We're not sure how this qualifies as an upgraded experience, especially when it removes basic features like searching your phone's settings and contacts. But with Google pushing AI features with almost every update, we're not saying we didn't see this coming.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google is introducing users to CC, its latest AI agent that it crafted alongside Gemini to leverage data in Workspace apps like Gmail, Calendar, and Drive. According to the company, CC will deliver a briefing that "synthesizes your schedule, key tasks, and updates into one clear summary, so you know what needs to be done next."</p><p>All of this is compiled into a daily "Your Day Ahead" overview, which gets "delivered" to your Gmail every morning.</p><p>For example, when it comes to reminders, CC will display those in its briefing within the "Top of Mind" category. These are typically tasks that should get done before tackling the day. The AI agent will display additional reminders that are important, but aren't time sensitive for that particular day, under an "FYI" listing. Additionally, CC dives into your Calendar to surface important events that day, including the time, location, and potential duration of the event.</p><p>Google states that what CC surfaces is what's "important to you," as it uses what you've set in Calendar, Drive, or received through Gmail. The personalization side of CC is through emailing. Users can email CC, telling the AI agent to add a new event. CC is said to do so accordingly by throwing that event into the Calendar if necessary.</p><h2 id="cc-google-s-ai-2">CC Google's AI</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mxixh5rNqn8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google says users who email CC with custom requests are "teaching it things" about them. Moreover, users can email CC to remember "ideas and todos." Creating an overview isn't everything the AI can do, as Google highlights its ability to prepare email drafts for your morning brief. Similar to events mentioned in the daily brief, CC will offer direct links to your Calendar events "to help you take action quickly."</p><p>If interested, Google says users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google/cc">can sign up</a> for its CC waitlist via Labs. Early access starts today (Dec 16) for users 18 and older in the U.S. and Canada. However, Google AI Ultra and paid subscribers get in first.</p><p>Google Labs has been busy recently, as it also announced "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-disco-experiment-is-an-ai-browser-that-turns-your-tabs-into-mini-apps">Disco</a>," an AI-fueled browser that can create mini apps from your tabs. The feature is called GenTabs, which takes information previously given by the AI and turns it into an interactive experience. If you're researching meals to build muscle or adhere to a specific health requirement, Disco's GenTabs can turn that into a comprehensive app that shows what meals to make on specific days.</p><p>Users can plan trips with Disco's GenTabs, which can create a map based on the location you're going to with pins about places to eat, visit, and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you.

If this is something you might want or need, it's a great deal.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bypHukkTkraENuHJsvDmUN" name="Roku-sports-experience.jpg" alt="Roku sports experience" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bypHukkTkraENuHJsvDmUN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roku)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are many ways to stream media from the internet to your eyes, but most of them are extremely expensive, not so with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/roku-streaming-stick-4k-vs-chromecast-google">streaming sticks</a>. These tiny gadgets plug into the HDMI port on a television and connect through Wi-Fi to stream all sorts of live TV, sports, and movies. Here's what's great about the Roku.</p><p><strong>It's cheap</strong>. You're going to waste $30 this week on something. If you give up a couple of lattes or cook at home one extra evening, you can buy this instead.</p><p><strong>It's easy</strong>. Roku's interface seems cluttered at first, I'm not going to lie. But if you take just a minute and zip through it, everything is categorized nicely, and there is no Google or Amazon changing everything on your home screen to infuriate you.</p><p><strong>It works with everything</strong>. It simply sends an audio and video signal through HDMI. That means it works on every TV made in the last 20 years, and even a computer monitor. As long as you can get an unfettered Wi-Fi connection (more on that further down the page), it just works.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1365px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CHexkzQmP9dXHKZjxSTDkH" name="tp-link-archer-wi-fi-7-announcement.jpg" alt="TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 router announcement" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHexkzQmP9dXHKZjxSTDkH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1365" height="768" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TP-Link)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing is perfect, and there are some things to think about before you fork over your money. Everything works that way.</p><p><strong>It's not very powerful</strong>. I have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-shield-tv-pro-still-worth-buying">Nvidia Shield Pro</a> and an old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-tv-cube-2019-vs-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k">Amazon Fire TV</a>. One is really fast when scrolling through menus or getting a stream to start, while the other is ass. This Roku is right in the middle. It will show you what you want to see, but it might take an extra few seconds to get there.</p><p><strong>It's Wi-Fi only</strong>. We all have that spot in our home where the Wi-Fi isn't as fast as it is everywhere else. I happen to have a television in one of those spots, and because my Shield Pro can use Ethernet, it works fast. If I were forced to use Wi-Fi, I'd see some buffering, or the picture would suffer.</p><p><strong>It needs "open" Wi-Fi. </strong>No, not the public and unsafe kind of Wi-Fi, but a connection without a captive portal. Ever use Wi-Fi on a plane or in a hotel and have to start on a specific page or enter some sort of code? This isn;t going to work there. That's kinda bad because this gadget is the perfect price and size to carry with you on a business trip or vacation. There are workarounds, or you could tether from your phone's connection, though.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>So, should you buy the Roku Streaming Stick 4K?</p><p>If you want a cheap and easy way to stream videos and still get great video quality, the Roku is 4K (of course, it's in the name) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-hdr10-and-why-does-it-make-galaxy-s10-screen-better">HDR10</a>. It will look as good as the screen it's attached to.</p><p>If you want Google or Amazon in the picture, so you can use apps or decent voice commands, pass on this one.</p><p>Finally, if you're looking for something to bring along on a business trip, check out the different ways to use a Roku with Hotel Wi-Fi and decide if you can live with them. if so, $30 gets you some entertainment instead of paying for PPV hotel movies.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6ddd924d-8741-4694-997c-455b80fa9255" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="For just 30 bucks during Walmart's holiday sale, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K gives you instant access to all of your favorite streaming services with free live TV channels, Dolby Vision, and HDR10+ support.

Google officially added Qi2 support with built-in magnets to the Pixel 10 series via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>, and Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-accessories-leak">rumored to do the same</a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 series</a>.</p><p>When it's time to upgrade your phone, it'll also be a good idea to upgrade your wireless charger. There are a few first-party options from Google, but for the most part, Android users are looking to third-party accessory makers to fill the gap. Your next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2-supported wireless charger</a> might come from an unlikely brand: Ikea.</p><p>That's right — the Swedish home goods and furniture store that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ikea-launches-affordable-smart-sensors">also dabbles in smart home tech</a> now has a new lineup of official Qi2 chargers. The Ikea Västmärke is a donut-shaped Qi2 wireless charger with a few tricks up its sleeve. You shouldn't write it off as a gimmick, because it might be the best Qi2 charger for Android users on the market, and it's certainly the best value.</p><h2 id="wait-ikea-is-making-an-affordable-qi2-charger-2">Wait, Ikea is making an affordable Qi2 charger?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2ajRJShdUMPZ4kAmjUmFPG" name="Ikea-Qi2-Charger-3" alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ajRJShdUMPZ4kAmjUmFPG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ikea)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ikea's Västmärke wireless charger is available for just $10 in select stores, with delivery available as well. From a design standpoint, it's thicker than most other Qi2 wireless chargers. The product has a hybrid design, functioning as a portable wireless charging solution or a flat charging base for use on a desk or nightstand.</p><p>The donut shape is certainly striking, but it fits right in with Ikea's modern design language. It doesn't look like a tech product in the best way, complete with a "happy red color." There are no bland white, gray, or black color options that we're all too used to seeing in the tech space. It's available only in this intriguing circular shape and only in "happy" red.</p><p>The charging pad has a built-in cable that spans 47 inches, or just under four feet. It's a solid charging length that'll work for stationary desk setups but won't be too cumbersome on the go. The charging cable is made out of silicone. There's no power adapter in the box — you can use a 20W USB-C power adapter you already own or add one on from Ikea for an extra $4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VwfpWfxkEhUQvbfCC5BSWF" name="Ikea-Qi2-Charger-5" alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VwfpWfxkEhUQvbfCC5BSWF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ikea)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's fully certified by the Wireless Power Consortium, supporting both the Qi2 Baseline Power Profile and Magnetic Power Profile. This means it'll work with older Qi devices without magnets, and it'll also support snap connection with newer Qi2 ones. Notably, Ikea's Västmärke supports Power Deliver 3.0 and Quick Charge 2.0.</p><p>In other words, the Ikea Västmärke is more than just a gimmick — it provides everything you might need from a Qi2 charger.</p><h2 id="ikea-s-charger-solves-a-few-problems-with-qi2-cables-2">Ikea's charger solves a few problems with Qi2 cables</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bw2pTSLeJPGyApApbg2tVF" name="Ikea-Qi2-Charger-2" alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bw2pTSLeJPGyApApbg2tVF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ikea)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wireless charging is somewhat controversial among tech enthusiasts due to a few of its downsides. It's less efficient, slower, and hotter than charging over a cable. However, I find it hard to build out a wireless charging ecosystem for a different reason. Wireless chargers are only useful if they're where you need them, and most of the Qi2 chargers on the market would look sorely out of place in a living room.</p><p>Ikea's Västmärke addresses the issue of wireless chargers blending in, and it does it while making a fashion statement. The bright red color and silicone exterior look great, but there's more to it than that. The Västmärke design serves a functional purpose, too. The 47-inch cable can be coiled and stashed within the donut-shaped charger for cleaner storage and peak portability.</p><p>What's more, the donut's silicone surface actually pops outward to reveal a phone grip. It's like having a built-in PopSocket in your wireless charger. That's helpful because any Qi2 wireless charger adds bulk to your phone, and Ikea's Västmärke lets you keep using it while charging.</p><h2 id="i-m-buying-this-donut-shaped-ikea-charger-immediately-2">I'm buying this donut-shaped Ikea charger immediately</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="i8ByCNqnPZwRh8FooLnKwF" name="Ikea-Qi2-Charger-1" alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i8ByCNqnPZwRh8FooLnKwF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ikea)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If it wasn't for the price, I probably wouldn't have given the Ikea Västmärke another look. But the official Google Pixelsnap Charger is $40 and is relatively uninteresting, save for the fact that it can charge <em>only</em> the Pixel 10 Pro XL at 25W speeds. Instead, I can get four Ikea Västmärke chargers for the same price to cover my home with wireless charging pads.</p><p>With the cable stashed away, this Qi2 wireless-charging "donut" looks more like a modern art piece than a charger. For only $10 each, this clever, quirky wireless charger is one I think almost every Android user should consider adding to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">magnetic charging ecosystem</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="4a1b6596-0f26-4ab8-ba00-ba67dd3e5411">            <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/vaestmaerke-wireless-charger-30618425/" data-model-name="Västmärke" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SufAQ7UvCFRcCSENQBVmaE.jpg' alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Ikea</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Västmärke</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Standing out</strong></em></p><p>In a crowded wireless charger market littered with similar options, Ikea's Västmärke stands out with Qi2 support, a fun and colorful design, and a built-in phone grip.
