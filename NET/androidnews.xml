The internal 7-inch display is a tad larger than the Razr Plus 2025 while the cover screen is the same size, 4 inches.</p><p>To prevent accidental damage to either display, it's important to invest in some of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> screen protectors.

<h2 id="these-are-the-best-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-screen-protectors-2">These are the best Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 screen protectors</h2>
<p>Motorola does not recommend peeling off the factory-installed screen protector, especially the one on the inside. These are glad tidings as there are no 7-inch Razr Ultra 2025 screen protectors available to purchase for now. First and third-party options are sure to launch in the coming weeks. In the meantime, focus on the external cover display instead as that's always exposed and therefore more vulnerable anyway.</p><p>There are a handful of front screen protectors for the 4-inch front display of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 for sale right now. Happily, this includes both tempered glass and flexible plastic film options. On top of that, you can get privacy screen guards in both materials too.</p><p>The MOOISVS 2+2packs Screen Protector Moto Razr Ultra 2025 is the best overall choice when looking for a robust shatter-proof tempered glass front screen protector set. The kit includes two units of the front screen protector as well as two more units of camera lens protectors. However, the lens screen guards don't offer full coverage.</p><p>If you're worried about the lenses, I recommend the Zeking 2 Set Motorola Razr 60 Ultra Camera Lens Protector. It includes two pieces of durable tempered glass camera lens protectors with metal rims reinforcing the impact resistance. Plus, you can color match the metal rim to the shade of your Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 or your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-cases">Razr Ultra 2025's phone case</a>.</p>

<p>Arguably the best Garmin smartwatch on the market today, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> boasts an epic suite of 24/7 health and fitness tracking tools with an AMOLED display, NFC/GPS support, and up to 14 hours of battery life on a single charge. </p>
<p>Thanks to the current Amazon sale, you can grab this watch for $100 off. That's a return to the Venu 3's lowest price ever!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDC6LH5W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6bc89a23-f0b8-484e-9709-2b3942645e25" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$449.99" data-dimension48="$449.99">View Deal</a></p></div>

<h2 id="high-quality-screen-protectors-elongate-your-motorola-razr-plus-2025-s-lifespan-2">High-quality screen protectors elongate your Motorola Razr Plus 2025's lifespan</h2>
<p>The best quality Motorola Razr Plus 2025 screen protectors prevent scratches, cracks, and shatters on both screens, thereby extending its lifespan. It also helps to have a mint condition phone when you trade it in later on for a newer release. With that being said, here are the top picks you should consider.</p><p>Our best overall selection is the highly-rated Ruiheshiyi Motorola Razr Plus 2024 2025 Screen Protector 2 Pack. It's priced below $20, making it fairly reasonable and you get a lot of value for your money. The set includes two pieces of screen protectors as well as an assistive installation frame in the box. So even if you install it by yourself at home, you will achieve a clean result without running the risk of ruining the spare. The external screen protector is made of sturdy 9H tempered glass whereas the internal film is made of a robust TPU material.</p><p>If you don't like the glossy finish of glass or plastic films, Diacube sells a matte screen protector three-pack that's just nice. It costs almost the same as our first choice, but you get three screen protectors instead of two each for both displays. Although this three-pack is made for the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 — also known as the Motorola Razr 50 Ultra in some markets — it fits the Motorola Razr Plus 2025. As explained earlier in the article, both models share the same screen dimensions to make this possible.</p><p>Now that you've settled on a screen protector, consider purchasing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-motorola-razr-plus-2025-cases">case for your Motorola Razr Plus 2025</a> too. There are tons of excellent options available.</p>

For the first time, the Razr Ultra 2025 features a flagship processor, helping to make the smartphone a complete package.</p><p>However, Motorola is charging a pretty penny for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr Ultra 2025</a>. It retails for $1,299, which is the same price as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and $200 more expensive than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is also more expensive than the highest-end Razr available last year.</p><p>That means, regardless of whether you're considering an upgrade from an existing foldable or are trying one for the first time, the high price of the latest Razr could be an obstacle. The good news is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025#section-motorola-razr-2025-specs-cameras">Razr Ultra 2025</a> is jam-packed with hardware upgrades and improvements. If you can look past the price hike, this is arguably the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best clamshell foldable</a> on the market.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-upgrade-to-the-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-from-an-older-razr-2">Should you upgrade to the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 from an older Razr?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is a solid buy for most Razr owners, as long as you don't have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>. If you do have a last-generation flagship, the answer is a bit trickier. The newer model has a faster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</a>, a slightly larger 7-inch pOLED foldable display, and a bigger 4,700mAh battery. Those are tangible upgrades, with the improved battery life being the most likely to impact daily use.</p><p>With that being said, it still doesn't seem like enough to convince users to pay $1,299 for a Razr Ultra 2025, less than a year after paying $999 for a Razr Plus 2024. Even with trade-in deals or accessory promotions, the value simply isn't there. That's especially true when considering that the Razr Plus 2024 has a telephoto camera capable of 2x zoom, which some could consider a better option than the Razr Ultra 2025's ultrawide camera, although Android Central's Derrek Lee <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">thinks the ultrawide camera is the way to go</a>.</p><p>For those reasons, if you own a Razr Plus 2024, it isn't worthwhile to upgrade to a newer model so soon, no matter how tempting the upgrades might be.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gESYfYoXS2QaPatrbU5U2Y" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-closed-cover-screen-01" alt="Holding a Motorola Razr Plus 2024 while it's closed with the cover screen illuminated and unlocked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gESYfYoXS2QaPatrbU5U2Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Holding a Motorola Razr Plus 2024 while it's closed with the cover screen illuminated and unlocked. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While there are too many similarities between the Razr Plus 2024 and the Razr Ultra 2025, that's not true of the other Razr models.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a> feature the older clamshell design with smaller cover screens that aren't edge-to-edge. It might not jump out to you on the spec sheet, but the difference between the 3.6-inch pOLED cover screens on those models will feel a lot smaller than the 4-inch pOLED cover screen on the Razr Ultra 2025. That extra space makes using any app on the cover screen more manageable.</p><p>There's no question that the Razr Ultra 2025 will feel like a completely different device compared to even older models, like the Razr 2023, Razr 2022, and Razr 5G. It's worth the upgrade if you still enjoy the flip-style foldable form factor. Aside from all the aforementioned improvements, the latest model's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 16GB of RAM will help it thrive with intensive tasks, including everything from gaming to AI.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-05" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The build quality improvements available on the Razr Ultra 2025 are hard to understate, too. The hinge is expected to feel smoother than older models, in part due to a new design with titanium reinforcements. The smartphone also has an IP48 water an dust-resistance rating, and stronger Gorilla Glass Ceramic covering the outer screen.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-upgrade-to-a-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-from-a-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-2">Should you upgrade to a Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 from a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-and-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-cover-screen" alt="YouTube Music on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola already had an edge on Samsung's foldables, since it offers an unrestricted cover screen experience. Meanwhile, the smaller cover screen on even the latest Galaxy Z Flip models can't be fully taken advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">without using Good Lock</a>. If you own the newest Galaxy Z Flip 6, the Motorola Razr Ultra might be worth the upgrade.</p><p>There are a few key things to consider before you take the leap from a Samsung to a Motorola foldable, though. For starters, remember that Samsung is gearing up to launch a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> in just a few months. It might be tempting to look at the Razr Ultra 2025's chip upgrade as a reason to switch sides, but the next Galaxy foldable could have a similar improvement.</p><p>More importantly, know that the software support experience on the Razr Ultra 2025 will be wildly different from the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and older models. Motorola has notoriously poor software support, with Android OS upgrades taking a long time to become available, and experiencing major bugs after the fact. You're only guaranteed three Android OS upgrades if you buy a Razr Ultra 2025, compared to seven on the current Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9vaER3KiFVQ4ztkTpo7gag" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Gemini-cover-screen.jpg" alt="Gemini on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9vaER3KiFVQ4ztkTpo7gag.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung notably didn't have the best time rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> to Galaxy Z Flip 6 owners, but it does still have a solid track record for software support. Plus, Galaxy foldables generally offer a more polished experience than Motorola foldables — even if the latter can be more useful and customizable.</p><p>Those that are disenfranchised with Galaxy Z Flip devices might enjoy the upgrade to the Razr Ultra 2025, but the grass isn't always greener on the other side. Generally weaker cameras and worse software support are real cons to switching from a Galaxy foldable. But the bigger, unrestricted cover screen and powerful hardware could be enough to overlook all that and pick up a Razr Ultra.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="RohBotZnfQzj9EcAas6UNc" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-09" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with a ring around the cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RohBotZnfQzj9EcAas6UNc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, if you're in the market for a new foldable, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is an excellent place to start. It's expensive, sure, but not by a massive margin compared to flagships like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. With a truly flagship-caliber processor and a Motorola software experience that's quite similar to stock Android, the transition from a traditional smartphone to a Razr Ultra 2025 should be smooth.</p><p>It's also a neat upgrade from older Razr or Galaxy foldables, as the form factor really does get more durable and polished every year. However, foldable progress is slowing down a bit, so year-to-year upgrades aren't as impressive. Waiting a few years between foldable upgrades is certainly the right call, and those still rocking a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review">Galaxy Z Flip 4</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2023">Razr Plus 2023</a> or older are sure to feel the Razr Ultra 2025's improvements in a big way.</p><p>But beyond the Razr Ultra, Motorola also launched two cheaper Razr models for 2025, and we've quickly broken down each device to help you determine <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">which Razr 2025 model you should buy</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced that it's using its AI to detect and combat new online scams on Chrome, Search, and Android.</li><li>The tech giant claims that these advancements in AI technology have enabled Google to catch 20 times the number of scammy pages.</li><li>For Chrome, users will see the browser spamming unwanted or malicious notifications from a scam website, and they will be given the option to either unsubscribe or view the content that was blocked.</li><li>Google is using Gemini's Nano, an on-device approach that even spots scams that haven't been seen before. </li></ul>

<p>Google detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/how-were-using-ai-to-combat-the-latest-scams/">Keyword</a> post how it is currently keeping new online scams at bay with the help of Gemini. It released a report on how the tech giant has been working on detecting scams on Search, Chrome, and Android.</p><p>To start, the company says it has used Gemini's algorithms will quickly identify scammers' patterns and linguistic cues that are indicative of fraudulent activity, considering that scammers keep switching around their techniques, and don't stick to one pattern to get into people's online accounts and sensitive data.</p><p>Google says it's using Gemini to stay one step ahead of them: "Large language models have also helped us to scale our protections across languages to protect more people around the world," Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/documents/Search-Scam-Report-0508.pdf">report</a> stated.</p><p>With these improvements, the tech giant says it's been able to sieve through vast quantities of text on the web, identify coordinated scam campaigns, and detect emerging threats on Search.</p>

<p>For instance, Google says it was able to reduce fake airline customer service scams by 80% this past year on Search. Making it less likely for users to accidentally call a scam airline number.</p><p>Additionally, even though it spotted a rise in misleading pages mimicking official visa or government services, the new AI protection "decreased scams impersonating official sites by more than 70%," the company added.</p><p>As for Chrome, even though its "Enhanced Protection" setting detects and takes down spam websites, Google says that Chrome is using Gemini Nano, directly on the computer, to make this protection even better.</p><p>Gemini Nano's algorithm is trained to spot dangerous websites instantly, even when the scams are new. Gemini Nano's LLM is good at understanding how scam websites look, which helps Chrome keep up with new tricks.</p><p>"We're already using this new AI-powered approach to protect users from remote tech support scams, one of the biggest online threats facing users today."</p><p>Google says it will train Gemini to spot a wide range of scams in the future.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's next clamshell foldable might finally add a larger, more useful cover screen.</li><li>Leaked animation files from One UI 8 reveal the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will offer an edge-to-edge cover screen, like premium Motorola Razr models.</li><li>A revised report from earlier this month regarding the Galaxy Z Flip 7's design also points to a new cover screen.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr Ultra 2025</a> announced and hitting shelves shortly, Motorola has been using edge-to-edge cover screens on clamshell foldables for two generations now. To date, Samsung has moved incredibly slowly in growing the cover screen of its Galaxy Z Flip competitor. The Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 both had a cover screen with a cutout for the rear camera lenses, but that might be finally changing with the Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will sport an edge-to-edge cover screen that wraps around the rear camera lenses for additional space, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-design-leak-apk-teardown-3556568/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. The publication dissected leaked One UI 8 firmware and uncovered animation files for Galaxy Z Flip models, including the unannounced Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p><p>These animation files reveal tidbits about each model's design differences, as they're custom to the model they represent. For instance, the render for the Galaxy Z Flip 5 shows the pill-shaped rear camera housing and folder-style cover screen. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> animation file, on the other hand, shows the split rear camera lens arrangement and the same cover screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2982px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:23.00%;"><img id="GNZdmC6ebNaratfRQkcAoA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Leaked-Icons" alt="The prior two generations of Z Flip icons beside the new Z Flip 7 icon." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNZdmC6ebNaratfRQkcAoA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2982" height="686" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then, there's the leaked animation file for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, which clearly shows an expanded cover screen that extends all the way to the hinge and wraps around the rear cameras. This is a good of a sign as any that Samsung indeed plans to equip its next flip-style foldable with a new cover screen, matching the capabilities of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> and Razr Ultra 2025.</p><p>While the exact specifications of the new display are unclear, we can expect a cover screen measuring roughly four inches in size to debut on the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Aside from these leaked animation files, a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-leak" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> was revised earlier this month to also state that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will get a larger cover screen.</p><p>Paired with the leaked animation files, which come straight from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/someone-with-a-galaxy-s25-ended-up-getting-an-alleged-one-ui-8-update">One UI 8 firmware</a>, it seems safe to expect the next Samsung clamshell foldable to feature a fresh cover screen.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<ul><li>A Nemko Platform listing has reportedly picked up Samsung's next FE series earbuds, which will reportedly go by the "Galaxy Buds Core."</li><li>Little information is known about them, other than the inclusion of a 500mAh battery charging case and 200mAh batteries for the buds.</li><li>The Galaxy Buds 3 series launched last summer with a radical design shift that makes them feel more like Apple's AirPods.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's next FE earbuds are supposedly on the way, and with a few changes beyond their name.</p><p>A discovery by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-buds-core-bis-battery-details/">91Mobiles</a> via the Nemko Platform database suggests that a device with model number SM-R410<strong> </strong>is the next Galaxy Buds FE (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-buds-core-battery-capacity-3556632/">Android Authority</a>). Interestingly, the listing states the device will be called the "Galaxy Buds Core," which echoes a previous Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-2-buds-core-fcc/">FCC listing</a> found by the publication. According to Nemko, the earbuds' charging case was found with model number "EP-QR410."</p><p>The listing suggests the case could provide a 500mAh battery for charging bursts while on the go.</p><p>Moreover, the earbuds themselves could pack a 200mAh battery for music, calls, and more. Other listed information isn't too surprising, but it states the buds will carry Bluetooth connectivity, as usual. The publication reiterates its FCC findings, adding the device is expected to see Bluetooth 5.0 Plus support, as well as "dual-band Wi-Fi, up to 5.8GHz."</p>

<p>In 2023, Samsung launched several devices under its Galaxy FE umbrella, and one of those products was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-launch">Galaxy Buds FE</a>. These earbuds were based on the Galaxy Buds, but were seen more as a successor. The Buds FE offer immersive audio quality, three mics on each bud, Active Noise Cancellation, and Ambient Sound. Additionally, Samsung outfitted the device with 8.5 hours of playback, which jumped to 30 hours if you had your case on hand.</p><p>This is where things get interesting because the Galaxy Buds FE featured an "ergonomic" design like the Galaxy Buds. This was produced via its bulbous, wing-tip design.</p><p>If Samsung is truly looking at a return to the Galaxy Buds FE, and calling it the "Galaxy Buds Core," we might have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-and-galaxy-buds-3-go-official">an idea about its design</a>. Typically, Samsung's FE devices play off the design of the flagship version, and we have the Galaxy Buds 3 series to look at. Those offered a more radical design change, looking more like Apple AirPods with a long stem.</p><p>The company said the change "enables a more intuitive physical experience by allowing you to control the device by simply pinching or swiping up or down on the blade" for controls. However, there's also a chance Samsung will resurrect that old wing-tip design to differentiate the "Galaxy Buds Core" from its flagship models.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

Then Lenovo did something unexpected when announcing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo/lenovo-legion-tab-fourth-gen-social-media-teasers">Y700 4th Gen</a> — it also introduced a dedicated controller. But this isn't like anything you've ever seen.</p><p>Instead of adding another expandable controller to a market that's already saturated, Lenovo introduced a dedicated "controller shell." Basically, you're able to remove the backplate, slot in the Y700, reattach the back, and be ready to go.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XQZHtkBGo6MY3ixGjHAy4f" name="lenovo-y700-gen-4-press-render" alt="Lenovo Y700 Gen 4 Press Render (Translated)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XQZHtkBGo6MY3ixGjHAy4f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1520" height="855" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo / Google Translate)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few reasons why this is so exciting, starting with the fact that it basically turns your tablet into an Android-powered Legion Go handheld. In case you weren't aware, the Lenovo Y700 2nd Gen actually uses the same screen as the original Legion Go that was released in 2023. And while I'm not 100% positive, I'm fairly certain it's the same screen that's found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/lenovo/lenovo-legion-go-s-review">Legion Go S</a> that was announced at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovos-trio-of-new-tablets-have-something-for-everyone">CES 2025</a>.</p><p>After translating some of the material shared during the announcement, it appears that Lenovo is actually set to release two versions of the "Controller G9." Most of the features look to be the same for both, with at least one notable exception, as the G9 Pro features a different speaker system.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1921px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="qUt4Bv664Exqud5wNEcDAf" name="lenovo-g9-tablet-controller-overview" alt="Lenovo G9 Controller feature overview" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qUt4Bv664Exqud5wNEcDAf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1921" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you were to spend a bit of time on either <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sbcgaming/">r/SBCGaming</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/">r/EmulationOnAndroid</a>, I would be shocked if you didn't come across a post about the previous Y700 models. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablet</a> has become a darling in the emulation and gaming community, as the 2nd Gen has a compact design and a microSD card slot. The 3rd Gen fell off a bit in popularity, not because of its functionality, but mainly because Lenovo decided to ditch the expandable storage.</p><p>It seems that Lenovo is listening to the community, as the Y700 4th Gen brings back the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot. Plus, it's powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, which has been a mixed bag in terms of emulation but is still a powerhouse chip.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ozntGWzhmbrJDgm4zJu8TX" name="gamesir-gamehub-home-screen" alt="Emulation on Android devices with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, AYANEO Pocket DMG, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozntGWzhmbrJDgm4zJu8TX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it might seem counterintuitive to use a tablet inside a controller shell, to me, it just adds another layer of flexibility. Instead of trying to get the tablet to connect to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">external controller</a>, I can just pop it into the shell and start playing. But it comes with the added convenience of being a "regular" tablet when the situation suits me.</p><p>Lenovo has yet to confirm whether the Y700 4th Gen will actually make its way to this side of the world. For one, the Legion Tab was only just recently released, which is basically a Y700 Gen 3 with different branding. It will seem a bit odd if we see a new iteration, less than six months after the previous one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="CjCr5eNKxfhQwiNe3MDvFj" name="lenovo-legion-tab-2024-lifestyle-render.jpg" alt="Lenovo Legion Tab (2024) lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CjCr5eNKxfhQwiNe3MDvFj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other thing holding Lenovo back from bringing this to the States is the current economic and political climate. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/things-arent-looking-good-for-gaming-handhelds" target="_blank">back-and-forth tariff situation</a> between the U.S. and Chinese governments has been wreaking havoc on everything, not just electronics. Because of that, a number of companies raised prices, whether on devices or accessories.</p><p>With that in mind, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://item.lenovo.com.cn/product/1045696.html">Y700 Gen 4</a> is priced at either 3299 CNY for the 12GB/256GB model or 3799 CNY for the 16GB/512GB variant. That works out to around $455 and $525, respectively, with the G9 controller priced at $69. In total, you're looking at about $600 for everything, which doesn't sound completely terrible compared to the Legion Tab and its $549 price tag.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:114.35%;"><img id="9HqHk6g5wiMGSVMfbtJqV" name="lenovo-legion-g9-controller-features" alt="Breakdown of different features found on the Lenovo G9 controller for the Y700 Gen 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9HqHk6g5wiMGSVMfbtJqV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="690" height="789" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo / Google Translate)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, it's highly unlikely that we would see Lenovo offer similar prices if it were to release the tablet and controller here in the U.S., but we'll see as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/12/business/us-china-trade-deal-announcement-intl-hnk">the tariff situation progresses</a>.</p><p>Despite Lenovo seemingly having a difficult time keeping the Legion Tab stocked, I'm not sure that the same would be true if it were more expensive. With that in mind, I'm not holding my breath for the latest Y700 and its controller to actually come to the States, but who knows what will happen. It's just awesome to see a company think outside of the box for once.</p>

<hr>
<p>Extremely early rumors surface about the next OnePlus flagship and its potential changes from the 13 model.</p><p>Rumors stem from a post by the Chinese Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.weibo.com/6048569942/PrrSQrdd0?pagetype=profilefeed">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS), which alleges a new OnePlus phone is already in development (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-15-key-specifications-tipped/">91Mobiles</a>). While not stated explicitly, the phone is suspected to be the successor to the OnePlus 13, the OnePlus 15. This is due to the tipster's alleged discovery of the SM8850 SoC, which is suspected to be Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite 2.</p><p>A few other specifications suggest the OnePlus 15 could debut with a large, flat 6.7-inch LTPO display with 1.5K resolution.</p><p>The tipster also mentions the use of the LIPO packaging process, which the publication states may aid in further reducing its bezels. Lastly, the front of the device is said to feature a "symmetrical front" and likens it to the feel of an iPhone. On the flip side, the OnePlus 15 could boast a (machine-translated) 50MP periscope lens for its purported triple array.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that the number "4" is associated with bad luck, thus the reason behind OnePlus' expected number 14 skip.</p>

<p>Theories around the OnePlus 15's cameras seem to conflict, as the publication taps tipster Smart Pikachu. Per their information, the device could feature a wildly upgraded 200MP periscope lens, not 50MP.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-13r-launch">OnePlus 13 and the 13R</a> debuted on January 7 with a large amount of AI software and a refined camera system. The key aspect we're concerned with is the OnePlus 13's display, which is a 6.8-inch QHD+ screen at 2K resolution. The current rumors suggest consumers could be in for a slightly smaller display and a downgrade in resolution for the next flagship.</p><p>Additionally, the triple camera array for its soon-to-be predecessor included a 50MP primary lens, a 50MP ultrawide camera, and a 50MP 3x Triprism telephoto. Thanks to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery tech</a>, the OnePlus 13 features a 6,000mAh battery. This may continue into the 15 edition, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 mention is interesting, considering there are rumors Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/early-snapdragon-8-elite-2-quicker-summit-phone-launch-rumors">could release it earlier this year</a>. Such rumors suggest Qualcomm's next Elite could launch at the end of September, which would roll right into phones expected to rock the SoC in early October. Speed-wise, the main core of the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 could reach 5GHz due to "enhanced Pegasus cores."</p><p>OnePlus usually releases its phones in China first before a global debut, and that may see a slight shift on the calendar this year.</p>

<h2 id="expect-a-long-road-of-os-and-security-updates-for-the-galaxy-z-flip-7-2">Expect a long road of OS and security updates for the Galaxy Z Flip 7</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> is not expected to launch till July 2025, but all the rumors surrounding it so far point towards it being a pretty sizable upgrade. Samsung may finally have an offering that can go toe-to-toe with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-2025-series-emulates-samsungs-three-product-strategy">Motorola's Razr Ultra 2025</a> flagship foldable.</p><p>The outer display of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is finally expected to go edge-to-edge, enveloping the outer cameras. It's nothing that we haven't seen before, but it's high time Samsung delivered such an outer display. A few leaks have also suggested we could see a slightly larger folding screen thanks to reduced bezels. All these changes could truly make it earn the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable</a> title, if Samsung follows through.</p><p>Software will most likely be new, with Samsung debuting One UI 8 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> in all likelihood. We have no idea what this will look like and what new features are going to be present, so we'll have to wait and see. If that's the case, then if Samsung sticks to its same update promise afforded to its other flagships, the phone may receive as many as seven years of updates, likely up to Android 23.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the specs of the Flip 7, it will most likely sport Samsung's custom '<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>' SoC, 12GB of RAM, and a base storage of 256GB. The cameras on the upcoming Flip are expected to be more or less the same, but the battery is expected to be a tiny bit larger. We hope to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-charging-speed">charging speed being bumped up to 45W</a> as well.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><u><em>Ultimate Guide</em></u><em>.</em></p>

<p>Just two years ago, the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 was one of the best clamshell foldables money could buy, but a lot has changed about Motorola flip phones over that span. Now, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is here, and it couldn't be more different from the Razr Plus 2023. The newer model is faster, has a bigger cover and inner screen, and sports a better camera system.</p><p>So, is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr Ultra 2025</a> worth upgrading to if you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>? With a high price tag, the better specs and polished experience might be enough to justify an upgrade. Additionally, the Razr Plus 2023's discounted prices might make it a sleeper option as an ultra-budget foldable in 2025. Let's break down how these two Motorola flagships, one current and one former, compare.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2023-pricing-and-availability-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Razr Plus 2023: Pricing and availability</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4182px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tKsMgt6w3cLLWByePA9ebY" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-vs-Razr-Plus-2023-5" alt="The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 and Razr Plus 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tKsMgt6w3cLLWByePA9ebY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4182" height="2352" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is available to purchase as of May 15 at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola's online store. It costs $1,299.99 for the 512GB variant and $1,499.99 for the 1TB storage configuration. You can get it in Pantone Rio Red, Pantone Scarab, Pantone Mountain Trail, and Pantone Cabaret colorways.</p><p>While the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 is two years old, it's still available from trusted retailers in new condition. For example, you can get a Razr Plus 2023 in Infinite Black from Best Buy for just $349.99, and that drops to only $249.99 with cellular activation. Considering the latter price is over $1,000 cheaper than a new Razr Ultra 2025, the Razr Plus 2023 might be a sneaky budget option.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2023-design-and-display-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Razr Plus 2023: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-05" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a lot of physical similarities compared to its predecessor, but the differences start to pile up against the Razr Plus 2023. The newer model is bigger and heavier by nearly every measure, with dimensions of 73.99 x 171.48 x 7.29mm when open, compared to 73.95 x 170.83 x 6.99mm for the Razr Plus 2023. It weighs 199 grams, compared to the Razr Plus 2023's weight of 188.5 grams  — which could be a noticeable difference in your pocket.</p><p>The durability changes are interesting because the Razr Plus 2023 has better dust protection but weaker water resistance, thanks to its IP52 certification. By comparison, the Razr Ultra 2025 has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">IP48 dust and water resistance rating</a>. In simpler terms, the Razr Ultra 2025 can handle splashes and submersion in shallow freshwater for brief periods, whereas the Razr Plus 2023 cannot.</p><p>Additionally, the Razr Ultra 2025's hinge is stronger and sturdier, with titanium reinforcements within. The cover screen is protected by Gorilla Glass Ceramic, whereas the Razr Plus 2023 only has Gorilla Glass Victus.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AGhva8Br3mE9YRczDTadyM" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-1" alt="The Motorola Plus 2023 showing the display and hinge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGhva8Br3mE9YRczDTadyM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the first thing you'll notice by looking at the Razr Ultra 2025 and Razr Plus 2023 side-by-side is that the newer model sports much larger displays. The cover screen on the Ultra model goes edge-to-edge, measuring 4 inches. The Razr Plus 2023's cover screen is no slouch at 3.6 inches, but it's not as immersive or capable due to size limitations.</p><p>Both cover screens are pOLED panels, with the Razr Ultra 2025 offering a slightly higher 165Hz refresh rate. Since the Razr Plus 2023 still offers a 144Hz refresh rate, this isn't likely to be noticeable in daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sc9eyUbUzHfkfEH5dC2uPN" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-3" alt="The Motorola Plus 2023 showing the display and hinge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sc9eyUbUzHfkfEH5dC2uPN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the Razr Ultra 2025's main display, it's a 7-inch foldable pOLED screen with a "Super HD" moniker and 4,500 nits of peak brightness. In terms of size and display technology, this isn't a massive improvement over the Razr Plus 2023 and its 6.9-inch pOLED panel. However, the Razr Plus 2023 can only hit 1,400 nits of brightness, so the newer model will be much easier to see outdoors. Brightness matters more with foldable displays due to their glossy, plasticky coverings.</p><p>Colors are a bit subjective, but there is more room for personalization on the Razr Ultra 2025. The Razr Plus 2023 was offered in Infinite Black and Glacier Blue colorways, with a special Viva Magenta vegan leather option also available and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-special-edition-peach-fuzz-color">Peach Fuzz</a> option that was announced later. With that being said, it seems like only the Infinite Black model is widely available in new condition in 2025.</p><p>That makes the Razr Ultra 2025, which is offered in four colorways at launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">with wood and Alcantara fabric materials</a> also available, the better choice for style.</p>

<p>The glaring problem with the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 is that its processor and software support window are hardly future-proofed. The foldable has a Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chip that isn't nearly as powerful as modern-day successors, and it shipped with Android 13.</p><p>While you can upgrade the Razr Plus 2023 to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> right now, it was only guaranteed three Android OS upgrades and four years os security updates. That means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> could be its last, although we'll see how long it takes Motorola to ready the update for the Razr Plus 2023.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Razr Ultra 2025 is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, which is the best mobile chip you'll find on an Android phone. It also has 16GB of memory and a RAM Boost feature, particularly helpful for AI tasks.</p>

<p>Both the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 and the Razr Plus 2023 have dual-camera systems, but the former is much more advanced. It features dual 50MP sensors, including a main and ultrawide lens. While the Razr Plus 2023 has the same lens types, it only offers a 12P main camera sensor and a 13MP ultrawide sensor. As such, the Razr Ultra 2025 will offer more detail and clarity than the Razr Plus 2023.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2023 has a solid 32MP front-facing camera, but the Razr Ultra 2025 has an even better 50MP lens. Of course, you can use the rear cameras as selfie cameras by simply using the cover screen.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2023 is by no means perfect, with an underpowered processor, waning software support, and potential durability concerns in 2025. But its discounted price makes this two-year-old flagship worth at least a look as modern offerings continue to get more expensive. While the Razr Ultra 2025 is obviously better than the Razr Plus 2023 in almost every way, it's hard to argue that the former is $1,000 better than the latter.</p><p>Looking at the 2025 lineup, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025</a> might each be better upgrade paths for Razr Plus 2023 owners. They're cheaper and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-2025-makes-me-and-my-razr-plus-2023-jealous">still offer enough upgrades to make current Razr Plus 2023 users jealous</a>. However, there's no doubt that the Razr Ultra 2025 is the best foldable Motorola has ever made. If you can stomach the price, it's likely you'll enjoy the experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> reveal creeping up, a fresh leak may have jumped the gun and uncovered the full size specs for what could be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">top foldables</a> hitting the market this year.</p><p>Fresh off the launch of the Galaxy S25 earlier this year, Samsung is now setting its sights on another big launch just a couple months out. Everyone pretty much knows it’s Samsung foldable season. And while plenty of leaks have floated around before, the latest scoop drops the full size rundown on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><p>Based on all the buzz so far, the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 is shaping up to be Samsung’s slimmest foldable yet. It’s not confirmed, but seasoned leaker @UniverseIce is backing it up, laying down the exact numbers on just how slim, wide, and massive this device is going to be.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-s-next-big-flex-2">Samsung’s next big flex</h2>
<p>According to this latest leak, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 measures 158.4mm tall, 143.1mm wide, and just 3.9mm thick when unfolded. If that checks out, it’ll be Samsung’s tallest, widest, and thinnest foldable yet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2107px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.93%;"><img id="Jq5bDECNwUdcpjeEQucAg7" name="Galaxy-Z-Fold-7-dimensions" alt="dimension comparison for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jq5bDECNwUdcpjeEQucAg7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2107" height="715" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @UniverseIce / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For comparison, the Z Fold 6 clocks in at 153.5 x 132.6 x 5.6mm, and the Fold SE hits 157.9 x 142.6 x 4.9mm (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/11/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-thinner-bezels-dimensions-leak/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Another tidbit from @UniverseIce claims that the Galaxy Z Fold 7’s bezels are getting shaved down.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7' s inner screen bezel is narrow. In the picture, it is Fold6, and the width of the bezel pointed by the arrow is 1.9mm. The Fold7 is directly dried to 1.0mm, and the outer screen bezel of the Flip7 is also very narrow, only 1.2 mm. pic.twitter.com/FCdLLdzWls<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1920820304193916934">May 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>We’re talking just 1mm around the inner screen, compared to 1.9mm on the last model. Even the outer display’s border is going skinny, sitting at just 1.2mm.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:563px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.21%;"><img id="qony4bLZ9UxFgqeTPNYFKM" name="Galaxy-Z-Fold-7-bezels" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 7 bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qony4bLZ9UxFgqeTPNYFKM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="563" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @UniverseIce / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Trimming those bezels isn't just for show, it also makes the screen feel more immersive and give the whole device a cleaner, more premium look. It might seem like a small tweak, but on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it’s a big deal.</p><p>If this leak is on point, don’t be shocked if the Fold 6 ends up looking a little old-school next to its sharper, cleaner follow-up.</p>

<p>You might be confused to see some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-2024-screen-protectors">Razr 2024 screen guards</a> listed among the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr 2025</a> screen protectors. Don't be, because both phones share measurements and are identical twins. The screen sizes are exactly the same, 6.9 inches on the inside and 3.6 inches on the outside.</p><p>For those of you who aren't aware, all new phones ship with factory-installed screen protectors. When it comes to foldables, it is not recommended to peel off the pre-installed screen protector unless absolutely necessary. This rule is particularly important for the folding internal display, but can be disregarded for the regular external screen.</p><p>If you aren't happy with the pre-installed internal screen protector, do your research and change it very carefully. Getting an expert to change it for you if you lack confidence is a good idea. I highly recommend waiting it out to see whether you can use your folding phone as is for a few weeks before making this decision.</p><p>Should you choose to only swap the external screen guard, the Supershieldz kit is the best overall screen protector for the Razr 2025. This is a well-known brand with consistently great reviews. The price is very reasonable and you get premium features like hydrophobic and oleophobic properties to repel dirt, fingerprints, oil, and other debris. Supershieldz includes two tempered glass screen protectors for the Motorola Razr 2025's cover display in the box, each with curved edges to achieve maximum coverage.</p><p>Alternatively, Deekeewe is another cheap option. This two-pack includes two tempered glass screen protectors for the front display as well as two flexible TPU films for the internal screen. The $12 price is undeniably a fantastic bargain and customer reviews are decent overall.</p>

Buyers like their overall comfort and sweat resistance, while they also come in four color varieties: black and gold, cosmic silver, ivory, and my personal favorite, the particularly unique-looking transparent option.</p>

They feature simple, easy-to-use button controls, and up to 36 hours of battery life with the use of the charging case, or up to nine with just the earbuds. Most buyers also find them particularly comfortable, along with featuring IPX4 water and sweat resistance, making them a good pick for those who hope to use them when working out.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Beats is Apple-owned, so not all of the features made for iOS can be used with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. These also do not include their own customizable EQ features, though most Android and Apple devices will also have their own EQ suite, so that shouldn't be an issue for most users.</p>

The best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> cases are pretty limited for now, which is a stark contrast compared to the Razr 2025 and the Razr Plus 2025. This is probably in part because the latter models <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/can-i-use-a-motorola-razr-2024-case-on-a-razr-2025">can fit their last-gen counterparts' cases</a>, so there's a huge variety of cases to choose from.</p><p>But don't sweat it too much. Even if the official Razr Ultra 2025 case isn't available to buy in the U.S. yet, there are some outstanding brands like Clicks doing God's work. You can even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/this-is-not-a-drill-best-buy-bundled-up-the-new-motorola-razr-with-a-free-clicks-case">grab a Clicks Keyboard case for free</a> if you've pre-ordered the Razr 2025.</p><p>For now, here are the handful of decent phone cases available for the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025.</p>

<p>Clamshell foldables like the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 fold neatly into half and fit easily in pockets and bags. Small phones are easier to hold so you're less likely to drop them. Plus, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">Razr Ultra 2025 comes with some unique finishes</a> like vegan leather, Alcantara, and wood. This is why I believe it's okay if you choose to forgo getting a case for the Razr Ultra altogether. Still, if you're adamant about getting a cover for safety, that's okay too.</p><p>As there aren't many options on the market just yet, your choices are narrower when buying a Razr Ultra 2025 phone cover. The best overall case you can buy is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/your-favorite-android-phones-are-finally-getting-these-once-iphone-only-nostalgic-cases">Clicks Keyboard</a> because it removes the onscreen keyboard and adds a physical one instead. It's a superb accessory that adds scratch-proofing and a useful feature. The price, however, is a tough pill to swallow. If you pre-ordered the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 though, you can bypass the paywall and score one <strong>free of cost</strong>!</p><p>If you missed out on this offer, there are cheaper alternatives to consider. ARMOR-X has two neat cases for the Razr Ultra and they're both priced about $20 or less. Then there's the transparent FNTCASE Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 Magnetic Case which is even cheaper and adds a magnetic ring on the back. The choice is yours, depending on whether you want to prioritize drop protection, extra features, or thinness.</p><p>For those readers who are still mulling over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">which Motorola Razr 2025 model to buy</a>, we've got a handy guide to assist your selection process.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is rumored to be working on a new privacy feature for the Gallery app—a "Private album" to hide photos and videos.</li><li>The update is still in beta, and while it might not be in the final release, it's in the hidden “Labs” section for now.</li><li>The Private album could be a simpler version of Secure Folder, focused just on photos and videos.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like Samsung is planning to beef up privacy in the One UI 8 Gallery app by adding a new way to keep your photos and videos out of sight.</p><p>While Samsung is still rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> in the U.S., early buzz around its follow-up is already starting to pop up. One UI 8, built on the upcoming Android 16, is already being tested behind the scenes. If all goes to plan, we’ll see it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-might-drop-the-one-ui-8-beta-way-earlier-than-we-think">drop sometime after Android 16 goes stable in June</a>, bringing some smart tweaks and smoother overall user experience.</p><p>X user @DalgleishGX spotted something interesting in the latest One UI 8 beta, namely a new “Private album” tucked right into the Samsung Gallery app. The leaker thinks it’s a simpler spin on Secure Folder, built just for hiding photos and videos without leaving the Gallery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:582px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:93.81%;"><img id="cNmQZLXgk43uPtJuynN2YB" name="Private-album-Gallery-app-One-UI-8" alt="a private album in the Samsung Gallery app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cNmQZLXgk43uPtJuynN2YB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="582" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @DalgleishGX / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">👀 Seems the latest leaked build of One UI 8 adds a Private Album feature to Samsung Gallery.This feature will most likely work like Secure folder but exclusively for photos and videos. pic.twitter.com/cFXegOLqht<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1920446883392053702">May 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Meanwhile, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-8-private-album-gallery-hide-images-leak/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, this “Private Album” feature might not come standard in the final One UI 8 rollout. Turns out, it lives in the hidden “Labs” section of the Gallery app. It's basically Samsung’s testing ground for experimental stuff that’s not meant for everyone just yet.</p><p>Some earlier guesses figured Samsung would use Android 15’s new Private Space API for this feature. That made sense, especially with talk of Secure Folder also jumping on board in One UI 8. Basically, it’d help make sure your hidden stuff stays hidden, and doesn’t randomly pop up where it shouldn’t.</p>
<h2 id="secure-folder-s-glow-up-2">Secure Folder’s glow-up</h2>
<p>Secure Folder is great if you want full-on lockdown for your apps and files, but it can feel a bit overkill for just hiding a few pictures. A built-in Private album sounds like an easier way to stash specific photos or videos without jumping through all those extra hoops.</p><p>Apart from Private album in Gallery, One UI 8 might step up how your phone handles background tasks, making everything run smoother. There’s talk of smarter app suggestions, better battery management, and more AI baked into the system.</p><p>Other leaks and rumors point to some cool new features in One UI 8, like video summarization in Samsung Internet and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-secure-folder-private-spaces-upgrade-rumored">upgrade to Secure Folder</a>.</p>

<p>This weekend, I flew to Plano, Texas, to check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-promises-100-percent-texas-manufacturing-ultrafactory-despite-oura-challenges">Ultrahuman's new factory</a>. After they walked me through every official step of manufacturing a smart ring, I had the chance to do every non-automated part myself. And it gave me a new appreciation for my own smart ring.</p><p>Smart rings aren't designed to be taken apart and put back together like other tech. You might know what sensors are inside, but you probably don't know what else is sitting inside all that titanium, resin, and ceramic, and what determines how thick these rings are.</p><p>But with Ultrahuman's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ring Air</a> in a sales and patent war with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring</a>, the company decided to show off its new American factory. This had the nice side effect of finally sating our curiosity about how smart rings are made, something other brands have been reluctant to talk to us about.</p><p>Plus, now I get to say that I helped make a smart ring that <em>someone</em> in the U.S. will buy!</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RCQFMYNFkbS4R4QqoM6CHa" name="UltraFactory-press-photo-1" alt="A press photo of the SVTronics "UltraFactory" manufacturing facility in Plano, Texas, with an UltraFactory banner above the workers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RCQFMYNFkbS4R4QqoM6CHa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The photo galleries below show nearly every step of Ultrahuman's smart ring-making process, starting with the creation of printed circuit boards (PCBs), which contain the SoC, PPG, IMU, temperature, and Bluetooth components.</p><p>These components are mass-producible — an engineer suggested one machine could produce 10,000 PCBs in a day — and made of fiberglass, polyamide, and ceramic materials, chosen to make them bendable enough to slide naturally into the rounded ring shape.</p><p>But the "UltraFactory" currently only makes about 400 smart rings per day, though Ultrahuman has promised to hit about 1,350 per day or 500,000 per year by the end of 2025. There are several pain points, starting with the fact that the other mass-produced components have to be soldered onto the PCB by hand.</p>

<p>After they create the PCBs, do internal and external spot checks for any flaws, and program each PCB with the requisite software, they're ready for the next step: soldering.</p><p>First, the Rx coil is soldered onto the PCB; then, the battery is soldered onto the coil. They brush off the excess alloy, leaving one seamless, bendable component ready to be inserted into the ring.</p>

<p>With a 3D-printed part, the welded-together PCB is curved into a proper J shape. The workers then apply glue to the titanium-carbon ring you're familiar with, remove the cover for the PCB's adhesive layer, and finally shove the component into place.</p><p>They do a software check — since technically, you could wear the ring at this point — and then place the ring inside a silicone mold. One mold with 12 rings is brought to the casting station, which is one part of the factory where they wouldn't let us photograph or record.</p><p>There, they inject epoxy resin into the ring from the thickest portion — the PPG — inside a vacuum-sealed chamber to prevent any resin bubbles. The process takes 24 hours, because heating the resin to harden it faster would damage the components. Ultrahuman said this casting process is one of the big pain points that slows down the ring process.</p>

<p>At this point, the smart ring is almost ready to be worn, but the resin will look rough and have hard edges that'll hurt your finger. They spend about 30 minutes cleaning and polishing it into consumer-ready form.</p><p>Once that's done, they do one more software check to ensure everything is up to code. Then, they place the ring on a 3D-printed part to check its size; if it won't fit or slides all the way down the cylinder, they know it's not to code. Otherwise, the Ultrahuman Ring Air is ready to be sold!</p>

<p>If you've been paying attention, you'll note that I couldn't make a smart ring from start to finish during this tour. The 24-hour resin process made that impossible. So it's more accurate to say that I got halfway through making a smart ring and then returned a different smart ring for the final part of the process. Nor did I get to handle any software or hardware QC.</p><p>I'm still going to say I made a smart ring, though. They told me my halfway-done smart ring <em>would</em> eventually be sold to someone, and that's pretty neat.</p>

<p>Following the steps above, I soldered the receiver coil onto the PCB by scraping some adhesive onto the coil and then stepping on a switch to trigger the machine (without burning off my thumbnail, thankfully). I then had to solder two separate points to attach the battery before brushing away the excess adhesive.</p><p>I curved the Ring Air components so they would fit inside, ripped off the adhesive with tweezers, shoved them inside the ring, and then pressed hard on the sensors to make them stick.</p><p>I was sure my clumsy, shaking fingers would break something, but it turned out my only issue was being too gentle. One portion came loose as I started to shove my smart ring into the casting mold, but I got it reattached and waved farewell to my ring.</p><p>Then they gave me another ring further along in the process and had me clean off the resin, using an electric spinning brush, sandpaper, and some 3M buffing fluid. I didn't get to finish the full 15+ minutes before Ultrahuman staff hustled me along to my interview, but I can honestly say I got that Ring Air into good enough shape that the resin wouldn't cut any fingers or look unsightly.</p>

<p>I asked Ultrahuman's CEO, Mohit Kumar, and chief business officer, Bhuvan Srinivasan, about smart ring repairability, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-are-disposable-tech" target="_blank">major issue with all smart rings</a>. The resin that keeps components in place and protected also makes it all but impossible to take rings apart for repair, and there are no visible buttons for resetting a malfunctioning ring.</p><p>They explained that they hope to add a tiny, hidden button to their smart rings. If a Ring Air is sent in for repair, they'll be able to remove a tiny bit of resin to hold down that button and reboot the ring into a mode where it can receive firmware updates.</p><p>I asked if they had any hopes for a more modular design that would let them remove and replace a battery, since smart ring batteries are so small and susceptible to losing capacity after a couple of years. Kumar replied that they're interested in it, but I got the sense that it's more of a pie-in-the-sky goal than something they're actively pursuing at the moment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YBixJGMPUduATKvadXrW8Q" name="Ultrahuman-factory-tour-ring-components-and-chart" alt="The different components of the Ultrahuman Ring Air in an dark, open-top felt box, with a diagram of ring components next to it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YBixJGMPUduATKvadXrW8Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For now, they're more focused on optimization. Because American labor costs are higher than in their Indian facility, they're looking to make the process more efficient; for example, they found a new casting machine that would inject resin into four times as many rings at once, breaking open that bottleneck in the factory line.</p><p>As for me, I'm curious how the manufacturing processes of other smart rings differ from those of Ultrahuman and how they are evolving as the tech improves. But proprietary differences aside, the UltraFactory experience gave me respect for the amount of quality control that goes into making a smart ring — while also surprising me that someone like me with no industrial experience can go through the steps with enough hand-holding and patience.</p>

While this information is interesting, the good news is that, as an Android user, you don't need to know or care about it at all.</p><p>Still, it's a significant change. Software can't stay backward compatible forever, and as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101811/0104/Translation-granule" target="_blank">hardware it powers advances</a>, things have to be adapted. A 16 KB page size means the system can spend more resources keeping everything smooth instead of writing table entries, and we all want things to run smoothly.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD" name="Google-services.jpg" alt="Google apps in a single folder on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In case you're wondering, Android currently uses a 4 KB page size. Inside a processor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit" target="_blank">memory management units</a> keep track of the physical location of all data in your phone's memory on a "page size" basis. Making that page size four times bigger means the system needs to make these translations four times less often. That's it. That's the whole enchilada.</p><p>For us, this means that possible bottlenecks can be avoided. We've all seen our phones stop doing anything for a second or two. This could be when opening or closing an app or loading a large app in the background. It can and does happen, but with this new change, this is less likely to be a problem in the future.</p><p>According to Google, the move to 16 KB page sizes means faster app launches from 3% to 30%, improved battery usage, quicker camera startup time, and speedier system boot-ups. Many of the changes may seem small, but the point is that things should cumulatively get better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5NibDvY72Uz7W65cCXUraB" name="64-bit" alt="Android is a 64-bit OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5NibDvY72Uz7W65cCXUraB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Memory management is very intricate and finicky. Small hiccups can cascade into something that we notice, though usually, it's all pretty seamless. Sometimes, a larger page size is part of the solution. Anything that is both future-proof and has the potential to improve performance is a welcome change.</p><p>Remember when Android started requiring all apps to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-releases-64-bit-android-l-emulator-intel-processors">support 64-bit processors</a>? I don't blame you if you don't. I think it's safe to say that none of us really noticed the difference. The change was needed to make sure that Android was ready for hardware advancements, but the change most likely made very little difference once it all trickled down to the user.</p><p>When there is better performance, everyone is happy, so the requirements are changing to support it all. This is the same sort of change. The page size on your phone has grown to a bigger size. With a bigger page size, there can be better performance.</p>
<div><blockquote><p>Starting November 1st, 2025, all new apps and updates to existing apps submitted to Google Play and targeting Android 15+ devices must support 16 KB page sizes.</p><p>Dan Brown, Google Play product manager</p></blockquote></div>
<p>You don't need to understand what a 16 KB page size is any more than you need to know what a 64-bit OS means. It's interesting and important all the same, so you'll see people talking about it.</p><p>Feel free to ignore all the jargon and complicated stuff in the article, or just think of it as Google doing what needs to be done to keep Android relevant in 2025 and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-32">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy S25 FE is on the horizon, and it might ditch Exynos 2400e for the Dimensity 9400 processor.</li><li>The upcoming device is originally planned with Samsung's in-house chip to keep costs down, but production issues may force a backup plan.</li><li>The Dimensity 9400 is no slouch: it's a 3nm powerhouse, but it’s also pricier since Samsung has to buy it from MediaTek.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is expected to land later this year, and while it's previously rumored to run on the Exynos 2400e, a new report claims Samsung might swap in the Dimensity 9400 instead.</p><p>Samsung's next Fan Edition model is shaping up to be one of the most talked-about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a> of the year, and for good reason. It’s expected to hit the sweet spot between solid performance and a wallet-friendly price.</p><p>To keep things balanced, Samsung needs to cut a few corners strategically. One way it could pull that off is by dropping in its own in-house chip to keep costs down without totally skimping on power.</p><p>Rumor has it that Samsung has already started cranking out Exynos 2400e chips, supposedly for the Galaxy S25 FE. That tracks, since most of the past Fan Edition phones have stuck with Samsung’s own chips.</p><p>However, a fresh scoop from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Galaxy-S25-FE-might-launch-with-a-Dimensity-9400-instead-of-an-Exynos-2400e.1013100.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a> suggests Samsung might have to pivot to MediaTek’s Dimensity 9400, thanks to some hiccups in its current chip production.</p>
<h2 id="chip-production-is-likely-getting-messy-2">Chip production is likely getting messy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ignmNpbWJn3Strf6Xggao3" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-ai-generated-wallpaper-flower" alt="A Samsung Galaxy 24 FE in the sun with High Brightness Mode enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ignmNpbWJn3Strf6Xggao3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notebookcheck has floated the idea that Samsung might be splitting chip production between the Galaxy S25 FE and the upcoming Z Flip FE, which has stirred up some concern. Earlier this year, word got out that Samsung Foundry was cutting its chip output by half to tackle quality issues. All these bumps in the road have fans wondering if Samsung can keep up with demand when these new devices finally arrive.</p><p>According to the outlet, switching to the MediaTek chip is more of a backup plan, something Samsung might pull the trigger on if it can’t pump out enough Exynos 2400e chips in time for the next Fan Edition release.</p><p>Samsung is no stranger to using MediaTek chips, but swapping in the Dimensity 9400 for the S25 FE isn’t without drawbacks. While the 9400 packs more power, it also comes with a bigger price tag since Samsung would have to buy it from MediaTek. On the flip side, sticking with the Exynos 2400e helps to save costs.</p>
<h2 id="don-t-expect-a-price-hike-2">Don’t expect a price hike</h2>
<p>The Dimensity 9400 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">turned heads last year as the first 3nm chip to land in an Android phone</a>. Meanwhile, the Exynos 2400e, built on a slightly older 4nm process, doesn’t quite hit the same performance highs as MediaTek’s fresh new silicon.</p><p>Even with a beefier chip, Samsung is probably not going to raise the price of the Galaxy S25 FE. It wants to keep it affordable and competitive, so if it does switch to the Dimensity 9400, it'll likely absorb the extra cost rather than pass it on to buyers.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Moto Watch Fit is a fascinating case study. Motorola left smartwatches behind for years, licensing out its watches to another company. Now Motorola seems to be stepping back into the fray with the Moto Watch Fit. But it needs more than the Moto Watch name to make its budget squircle watch stand out in a crowded field.</p><p>Long-time Android fans still think fondly about the Moto 360, which was ahead of its time with its cool gesture controls and seamless design in 2014. I wrote in March that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-doesnt-motorola-make-another-wear-os-watch">Motorola should return to Wear OS</a> with a spiritual successor to the 360.</p><p>Instead, a month later, we got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-buds-loop-watch-fit-spotlight-details-launch">budget Moto Watch Fit</a>, with its 1.9-inch squircle display, 16-day battery life, 100 sports modes, and "real-time fitness stats and intelligent sleep tracking."</p><p>It's the fifth Moto Watch tracker after the Watch 40, 70, 100, and 120, a mix of circular and squircle watches with the same basic fitness software and Google Fit integration.</p><p>Two weeks ago, I sent Motorola a series of questions. I wanted to know how the Watch Fit's "advanced fitness and wellness assistance features," how the companion app would work, and other basic questions. I'm still waiting on answers, and the more I research the Moto Watch brand, the more confused I get.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-unclear-how-involved-motorola-is-in-its-own-watches-2">It's unclear how involved Motorola is in its own watches</h2>

<p>The Moto Watch Fit isn't on sale yet, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/gb/en/p/motoaccessories/moto-watch-fit-smartwatch-1/pg38c07182">Motorola UK site</a> says this new model is "designed and manufactured by/for Motorola Mobility LLC."</p><p>Given the Moto branding, that should be obvious, right? But the official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motowatch.com/" target="_blank">Moto Watch site</a> lists Calgary-based CE Brands, Inc. as an "official brand licensee of Motorola" that "ensures global sales and support for the products found on this site," like the Moto Watch 120, 70, and 40.</p><p>CE Brands, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vitalist.co/">Vitalist</a>, says on its site that it "designs, manufactures, and sells" wearables, and lists Moto Watch as "our brand." And this 2024 Vitalist <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vitalist.co/press-releases/ce-brands-expands-motorola-smartwatch-lineup-with-all-new-moto-watch-120">press release</a> explicitly says the Moto Watch 120 is "the latest addition to [CE Brands'] line of Motorola smartwatches" as Motorola's "strategic brand partner."</p><p>If you look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.cebrands.motowatch&hl=en_US">Moto Watch 100 app</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ebuynow.motowatchlite&hl=en_US">Moto Watch 70 app</a> on the Play Store, both are managed by CE Brands, Inc. These apps have some pretty brutal ratings too, with many users calling them "barely functional" because they stopped syncing with Google Fit or allowing phone notifications on the watch without constant resets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fCzFsKodcSRNtdXXNW7QL8" name="moto-watch-100-app" alt="Screenshots of the Moto Watch 100 companion app showing the fitness features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCzFsKodcSRNtdXXNW7QL8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A CE Brands-made Moto Watch app (rated 2.2/5 on the Play Store) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CE Brands)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After a little digging, I realized that CE Brands owned eBuyNow, the subsidiary that made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-360-2020-gets-performance-boost-with-first-major-wearos-update">Moto 360 (3rd Gen)</a> in 2020. CE Brands <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/06/26/2694386/0/en/CE-Brands-Announces-Voluntary-Bankruptcy-of-Subsidiary-and-Resignation-of-CFO.html">went bankrupt in 2023</a> before rebranding eBuyNow as Vitalist in 2023, promising to "deliver biometric and biomarker insights to consumers."</p><p>The Moto Watch Fit <em>isn't</em> listed on the Moto Watch site, and Vitalist didn't write a press release about this model, either. That suggests Motorola may have taken over the brand, while ditching the numbered names for a Moto Watch revamp.</p><p>But it's also possible that Motorola Mobility designed the old Moto Watches, while CE Brands handled the health and software tools. It's hard to say, as the licensing deal makes it nebulous. Maybe Vitalist will make the Watch Fit health software, too?</p><p>Regardless, that's really all besides the point. My main point is that Motorola is best known for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-reminds-me-that-i-dont-need-the-best">making flagship phones from everyone else look overpriced</a> by offering similar perks in cheaper packages. However, the Moto Watch lineup has never really stood out against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> <em>or</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>, and Motorola has a lot to prove with the Watch Fit when it launches.</p>
<h2 id="how-will-the-moto-watch-live-up-to-the-moto-name-2">How will the Moto Watch live up to the Moto name?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="7JxfeTWgpfRjw9tPqDhDng" name="motorola-watch-fit-rendering-official" alt="The Motorola Watch Fit in its Trekking Green band color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7JxfeTWgpfRjw9tPqDhDng.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Look at the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitness-trackers">fitness trackers</a> out there: companies like Amazfit and Xiaomi have put intense effort into full-fledged health suites, AI coaching, and dedicated fitness tools in an affordable package. And you have bigger names like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-fit-3-tracker-finally-comes-to-us">Galaxy Fit 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> that sync directly with the biggest health apps, with their own AI insights and (for Fitbit) Google apps.</p><p>Motorola phone fans will see the Moto Watch branding and look for something affordable, long-lasting, and straightforward. However, the Watch Fit needs <em>some</em> kind of signature feature to stand out and keep these users happy.</p><p>CE Brands had an interesting Effort Points system that, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-cardio-load-and-target-load-explained">Fitbit Cardio Load</a>, scored your all-day effort based on your time in HR zones. But the Moto Watch Fit might use an entirely different system, and it'll have to compete with watch brands that invest huge amounts of money in health & fitness R&D.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="LSUEJejvdLNuNjidXvgLMQ" name="Moto-Watch-Fit-frame" alt="Moto Watch Fit frame" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LSUEJejvdLNuNjidXvgLMQ.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One sign of Motorola taking more direct ownership is how the Watch Fit can use Moto AI text prompts to generate watch faces. That's a unique trick, one I'm hoping Google emulates on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> this year. We'll see if people see it as a highlight or a five-minute gimmick; however, it'll depend on how good these AI-made faces are.</p><p>Otherwise, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/motorola-expands-its-device-ecosystem-with-the-new-moto-watch-fit-and-moto-buds-loop-featuring-sound-by-bose-technology-and-swarovski-crystals/">press release</a> mentions "seamless smartphone integration," but only mentions notifications, music controls, and camera controls. An RTOS watch can rarely do much more than that, even though many people will buy a Moto Watch hoping for actionable notifications and replies. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-balance-review">Amazfit Balance</a> pulls this off with text-to-speech and a keyboard, but I don't expect it from the Moto Watch Fit.</p><p>Ultimately, aside from the Moto AI gimmick, the Moto Watch Fit sounds pretty generic. The built-in GPS on a cheap tracker is a nice perk, but it's not uncommon these days — see the $99 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-active-2-announced-ces-2025">Amazfit Active 2</a> — and most fitness trackers have 100+ sports modes and IP68 water resistance.</p><p>That said, we've reached out to Motorola for more information about the Watch Fit, and we will update this article when we hear back.</p>

<p>The Moto Watch brand is like a time capsule to an early smartwatch era when they didn't try to squeeze dozens of features and a full AI-backed health suite into a device. Some people will appreciate its simplicity, affordability, and longevity; others will be frustrated by the lack of Motorola flair they've come to expect from its foldable phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025</a>.</p><p>It will ultimately come down to whether this Motorola-made wearable delivers a higher standard of quality than past Moto Watches.</p><p>I'm not sure why Motorola has been so hands-off with wearables up until this point, selling budget trackers through its licensee for years while spending R&D on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/motorola-adaptive-display-concept-best-for-sci-fi-not-real-life-use">wearable phone concepts</a> like the one above.</p><p>Maybe Motorola was truly so burned by its Android Wear experience that it never wanted to go back; clearly, Lenovo phone sales are strong enough despite not having a full "ecosystem" of devices. Or maybe it isn't willing to spend the money on health & fitness necessary to compete with Samsung Health and Fitbit.</p><p>Whatever the reason, the Moto Watch Fit needs to be a stepping stone to bigger and better things if Motorola wants to make an impact in the wearable space.</p>

<p>I'm an absolute sucker for new hardware, especially if it's paired with something else new and shiny, such as a recently launched processor. That same passion has trickled beyond the confines of phones, tablets, and Chromebooks and into the world of dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>. They come in all shapes and sizes, with varying levels of emulation power and form factors.</p><p>While I've written about why I prefer using gaming handhelds over my phone, recent events have, <em>ahem,</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-tariffs-are-a-great-reason-to-keep-the-phone-you-have-as-long-as-you-can">affected the market</a>. Even Linux-driven handhelds that were once cheap are seeing price increases that don't exactly justify a recommendation. With that in mind, I figured now would be a great time to revisit emulation and gaming on your phone.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dbAKUeZNXmEx9Rkj6cedji" name="gamesir-g8-plus-11.jpg" alt="GameSir G8 Plus controller with Vivo X100 Ultra slotted in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbAKUeZNXmEx9Rkj6cedji.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If we're going to go all out, you'll need one more piece before turning your phone into a mobile gaming station. Gone are the days when we had to <em>only</em> rely on console controllers, as there are so many different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">phone controllers</a>, it's enough to make your head spin.</p><p>With so many options, it can be difficult to actually make a decision on what to get, so you'll want to figure out the features and options that you want. If you don't care about bulk or have a device with a larger screen, then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-plus-review">GameSir G8 Plus</a> is my first recommendation. It relies on Bluetooth, but can be expanded to fit the 14.6-inch Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, without much hassle.</p><p>Do you need something that is more compact? Check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS ROG Tessen</a>, which is one that I keep in my bag whenever I'm going to be away from home for more than just a day or two. It connects via USB-C, offers passthrough charging, and features programmable rear paddle buttons.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Py2DiNxKJ8Vt8kxJ4inRG3" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-39.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Py2DiNxKJ8Vt8kxJ4inRG3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>More recently, I've fallen back in love with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gaming-accessories/we-need-more-accessories-like-the-new-backbone-one-xbox-edition">Backbone One</a>, but more specifically, the Xbox Edition. It's not quite as ergonomic as the others, but it simply looks awesome, and I like the way that the buttons feel. That being said, I'm definitely keen on checking out the new Backbone One Pro, which was just recently announced and has a few unique tricks up its sleeve.</p><p>What if you're on a budget or just don't want to spend a bunch of money on a phone controller? There are plenty of options there, too, starting with just getting a phone clip for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OIVO-Controller-Mobile-Playstation-Dualsense/dp/B08QZC4G25">DualSense</a> or Xbox controller. Until fairly recently, the only options we had were to clip onto the controller on one end and phones on the other. However, we're starting to see more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Mechanism-Controller-Xbox-Wireless-Android-Core/dp/B0D8826FTP/">magnetic mounts</a>, which is excellent.</p><p>But if you like the idea of having a dedicated controller for your phone, then something like the budget-friendly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-Controller-Lightweight-Ergonomic-Controller/dp/B0DXPMVCWC">GameSir X5 Lite</a> will be up your alley. It's priced at just $35, connects via USB-C, and is designed to work with devices like the iPad Mini, with its 8.3-inch display.</p>

<h2 id="don-t-sleep-on-the-play-store-specifically-play-pass-2">Don't sleep on the Play Store, specifically, Play Pass</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EWhvh7FUSaHBrtsrkQQgF5" name="play-pass-halls-of-torment-pokemon-silver-s25-ultra-odin-2-pocket-dmg" alt="Play Pass on the S25 Ultra with Halls of Torment on the Odin 2 and Pokemon Silver on the Pocket DMG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EWhvh7FUSaHBrtsrkQQgF5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've been pretty critical about the Play Store when it comes to how it functions as a central place to discover and download new apps on Android. However, I don't share that same sentiment in regards to games, even if the top charts are overflowing with "Gacha" games. Thankfully, I very rarely ever actually look at the top charts, and it's all thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-games-google-play-pass">Google Play Pass</a>.</p><p>It helps that there's a dedicated tab at the bottom of the app, which lets me avoid the wasteland of regular Play Store games. That's not to say that every game available through Play Pass is a banger. But I will say that if Google separated it out of my Google One plan, I'd add another monthly subscription to my bills.</p><p>Seriously, Play Pass includes Stardew Valley, Dead Cells, Terraria, and Thimbleweed Park, just to name a few. If I were to buy just those four games, it'd cost me almost $30. Which just so happens to be what it costs to sign up for Play Pass for an entire year. Plus, if you have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a>, there's a chance that you can get six months for free, and you didn't even know it.</p>
<h2 id="play-pc-xbox-and-ps5-games-on-your-phone-2">Play PC, Xbox, and PS5 games on your phone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VdveuQoL5dprWD8Ptm9NGF" name="viture-x-8bitdo-ultimate-controller-oneplus-13-monster-hunter-01" alt="Playing Monster Hunter Wilds via GeForce Now on a OnePlus 13 with a Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller without the glasses plugged in" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VdveuQoL5dprWD8Ptm9NGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before getting to my favorite part, what if you're a console or PC gamer, and want to be able to play from anywhere? There are actually quite a few options, starting off with the obvious ones like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-play-xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-on-chromebooks">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>, PlayStation Plus Premium, and Amazon Luna. While dedicated first-party apps are available for those services, you might want to take <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studio08.xbgamestream&hl=en_US">XBPlay</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng">chiaki-ng</a> for a spin, as I've found these to offer much better experiences.</p><p>From there, we have the likes of GeForce Now and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://boosteroid.com/">Boosteroid</a>, which tie into multiple platforms and make your games accessible over the cloud. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/geforce-now">GeForce Now</a> is another one of those subscriptions that you'll have to rip from me, as I've been signed up for as long as I can remember. It's been the best cloud gaming service that I've ever used, and quickly filled the void left when Stadia was retired.</p><p>While I have no plans to ditch my GeForce Now subscription, there is another solution that has been slowly becoming a favorite of mine. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo">Apollo</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/moonlight-android">Artemis</a> are community-built forks for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android">Moonlight</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine">Sunshine</a>. Basically, think of it like GeForce Now, but with ALL of your games. Instead of relying on NVIDIA's servers, which do have various restraints, Apollo and Artemis have no limitations, as <em>you</em> can install and manage everything.</p>
<h2 id="get-the-right-emulators-2">Get the right emulators</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qS4S6qu2AzE725VricXni8" name="lenovo-tab-p12-pro-review-aethersx2.jpg" alt="Lenovo Tab P12 Pro playing AetherSX2 PS2 emulator" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qS4S6qu2AzE725VricXni8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now for the fun part — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulation</a>. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best budget phones</a> are more capable than you might think. For example, the Snapdragon 865, which is now more than five years old, is still capable of emulating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/this-is-how-nintendo-aims-to-stop-switch-2-emulation">Switch</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3</a> games on Android. That's probably more of an outlier than a rule, but it still proves my point.</p><p>When it comes to the emulators that make all of this possible, there are a couple of different routes to take. The first of which is to download a separate emulator for each console that you want to play. However, that can be annoying and cumbersome on a good day, so it's not really something that I'd recommend.</p><p>Instead, I've compiled a list of the various emulators that I would recommend, starting with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a>. This single app can handle all the way up to PS2, and includes a bunch of extra features such as built-in shader support and the ability to rack up your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://retroachievements.org/">RetroAchievements</a>. Another great aspect of RetroArch is that it can run on basically anything besides a literal potato, but even then, you might find some luck.</p>

<p>You'll also notice that I've listed a few options for different consoles. Much of this can simply be attributed to some emulators working better with certain processors and devices than others. It's really just about doing a bit of trial runs to see what doesn't work while having alternatives if you need them.</p>

<p>It's great that you have all of your games, streaming apps, and emulators downloaded. But even if you throw everything into one folder, it doesn't really give you that true gaming experience. That's where launchers come into play, of which I rotate between three different ones.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://es-de.org/" target="_blank">ES-DE</a> is the Android version of the popular EmulationStation launcher available on x86 devices. It includes support for more than 150 different systems and makes it easy to scrape your games to show the artwork and download different themes based on your style.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/likeich/console-launcher" target="_blank">Console Launcher</a> is a newcomer to my arsenal, but I've been using it on and off for the six months or so. While ES-DE might seem a bit more polished, Console Launcher feels better suited for Android, designed for the platform from the ground up. There are a bunch of features, including a dedicated "Samsung DeX" mode, which avoids any potential issues faced by Samsung's limitations on launchers.</p><p>Although this isn't the definitive list, the last one that I've primarily used is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magneticchen.daijishou" target="_blank">Daijisho</a>. It has most, if not all, of the same features as the other two but simply offers a different design. Like ES-DE or Console Launcher, there are a variety of themes that you can download and apply if you want to change things up.</p>

<p>As I said before, you don't <em>need </em>a dedicated gaming handheld just to play games on the go. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phone in your pocket</a> is more than capable of playing thousands upon thousands of games. And that includes those who want to dip their toes into the world of emulation, provided that you understand the potential limitations.</p><p>Nevertheless, I hope this has helped give you some sense of direction as to how you can set up a phone or tablet to become the mobile gaming beast that it's capable of being. It'll definitely take a bit of time to get everything set up, but that hard work will pay off when you can just turn on your phone and start playing.</p>

After LG's departure, it was one of the only other smartphones to carry a built-in stylus, aside from Samsung's premium S phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. So naturally, with the Moto G Stylus 2025, there's a bit of pressure to really entice customers away from a flagship phone that costs more than three times as much.</p><p>Fortunately, I think Motorola has nailed it. The Stylus 2025 improves on last year's model in ways I didn't think the company was ready for, with specs that easily rival some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. And while the $400 price tag means you won't get all the capabilities of a premium Android smartphone, the Moto G Stylus 2025 has just about everything you'd need without all the superfluous bells and whistles that end up costing you $1000 or more.</p>

<p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-launch-details">announced</a> on April 8 and went on sale in the United States on April 17. The phone retails for $399 when purchased unlocked from Motorola and retailers like Amazon and Best Buy.</p><p>Color options include Gibraltar Sea and Surf the Web, although availability may depend on the carrier. Depending on where you buy it, you get 128GB or 256GB of storage, but it'll come with 8GB of RAM either way.</p>

<p>I've previously noted how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-hands-on">there are a lot of things to like about the Moto G Stylus 2025</a>, and after spending more time with the phone, all of that still rings true. The phone has a wonderfully simple yet effective design that mirrors some of last year's flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-ultra-launch">Edge 50 Ultra</a>. The camera housing has evolved to a more stove-like design, while the vegan leather encases the entire back nicely. It's a soft and very comfortable phone to hold.</p><p>It's a pretty large phone, with a display at 6.7 inches, but the bezels are smaller than you'd expect for a phone at this price point. The phone is also a hair thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a>, but the battery capacity is still the same, which is nice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wUFx5mDHqDckDJ4HDBFuTD" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-8" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wUFx5mDHqDckDJ4HDBFuTD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola did something I didn't expect with the Stylus display, pushing it beyond what many midrange (and most flagships) offer by giving it a Super HD resolution. It's not a resolution I've seen much on a smartphone, but it makes the OLED display appear incredibly crisp.</p><p>It's surprising, given how Motorola is pushing a higher resolution than the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, while increasing brightness to 3,000 nits. The result is a sharp, bright display that's almost as good as the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr Ultra 2025</a>, and frankly, I would love to see more flagship phones with this resolution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JKoxYYDWmWfPYVPEEMTgmZ" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-review-11" alt="A video playing on the Moto G Stylus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKoxYYDWmWfPYVPEEMTgmZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is powered by a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3, coupled with 8GB of RAM. I would've loved to see a more powerful chip, maybe something in the 7 series, but after using the phone over the past few weeks, I can happily report that the phone performs quite well. The software is snappy, apps open quickly, and games play quite well.</p><p>You may experience some dropped frames if you're playing something graphically heavy like Honkai: Star Rail on the highest settings, but the phone is more than capable of smooth gameplay on high settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4189px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gXztokz46NhGh3KzZN6R2Z" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-review-12" alt="Honkai: Star Rail on the Moto G Stylus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gXztokz46NhGh3KzZN6R2Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4189" height="2356" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box. It's not much different from Android 14, and Motorola's Hello UX is a mostly inoffensive take on Android. There's not much built-in customization, at least on the levels you'll find on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>, for example, but I don't see this as a downside, especially if you want to keep things simple. After all, it's a $400 phone, so anyone buying this most likely isn't a power user.</p><p>I appreciate the noticeable lack of bloatware. Aside from a random gaming folder that you can easily disable and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/glance-reportedly-us-bound-later-2024">Glance screen</a> that's turned off by default, Motorola has done a great job minimizing unnecessary software on its midrange and budget phones.</p><p>I also appreciate that Motorola is improving its software update promise, even by a little. The phone is set to receive two OS upgrades and three years of bi-weekly software updates. Last year's Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 has been receiving updates pretty consistently, and the Moto G Stylus 2023 received Android 14 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-14-is-finally-coming-to-the-motorola-razr-and-razr-plus-and-it-only-took-a-year">before the Razr Plus 2023 did</a>, so I'm hoping Motorola can keep this up.</p>

<p>There is some AI here, but don't expect a Pixel 9a here. Motorola's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> features are mostly reserved for higher-end phones, but there are still some goodies here worth pointing out. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> is one of my favorite features, and it's great to see it on this phone.</p><p>In addition to the usual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> AI editing capabilities, Motorola also included a new Sketch to Image feature that generates images in different styles based on what you draw. It's a neat feature and works fairly similarly to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">feature of the same name</a>, although not as fully featured.

<p>Another way Motorola applies AI is to the camera experience. The company upgraded the Moto G Stylus 2025 to a 50MP Sony LYTIA 700C sensor, and while last year's phone took pretty respectable photos, I've not been disappointed with the photo quality from this camera either. For the most part, images are crisp and vibrant, particularly in good lighting.</p><p>You can get some pretty good natural-looking bokeh from images, and the macro shots from the ultrawide camera are also surprisingly good for those of you who like to take close-up shots of nature.</p>

<p>Compared to last year's model, the Stylus 2025 doesn't attempt to brighten shadows nearly as much. On the other hand, images from the Stylus 2024 can sometimes appear a bit artificial and have flatter colors.</p>
<iframe allow="" height="470" width="100%" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=2991b150-2d15-11f0-bb23-0936e1cb08fb"></iframe>

<p>Where the AI comes in is with Action Shot, which can capture very high-speed images of moving subjects to reduce blur and ensure the subject is in focus. You can see from the images below how the Stylus 2025 does a much better job of capturing running water or a train in motion, although it may come at the expense of some dynamic range.</p><p>Basically, this is a nice feature to have if you own pets or have kids.</p>

<p>Battery life is pretty great, which is par for the course for Motorola's G series. I could easily get a day of use from the Stylus 2025, and you'll likely get the same or more, depending on your use.</p><p>Motorola also managed to get 68W charging on a $400 phone, which feels too good to be true for North America, but it really is incredible. From 1%, the phone will reach 50% in 20 minutes and 100% in 39 minutes. Someone tell Samsung.</p>

<p>Like last year's model, the Moto G Stylus 2025 utilizes an in-display fingerprint sensor. Frankly, it's not bad, but it's not my favorite either. It takes a second to register, and it's placed uncomfortably low on the display. This is the same issue I had with the Stylus 5G 2024, so it's annoying to see here, too.</p><p>Furthermore, the sensor flashes a very bright white when you use it, which is particularly jarring, especially when using the phone in dark spaces.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BMTnKb3KZxobYAXp3acZp7" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-review-3" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 fingerprint sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BMTnKb3KZxobYAXp3acZp7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera also has a few quirks, which I hope Motorola can tweak or fix with future updates. The phone does well in good lighting conditions, and post-processing can sometimes nicely enhance images beyond what is captured, but it doesn't seem to do too well in trickier lighting situations. As a result, some images can appear too dark or heavy in contrast. Again, it's about preference, but I would like to see at least some improvements with how it handles darker scenes.</p><p>It seems funny that this is even an issue, given Motorola's curious and seemingly pointless inclusion of a 3-in-1 light sensor (that third "camera" on the back).</p><p>Furthermore, while video can be pretty decent and stable up to 1080p at 60fps, things will start to crap out once you hit 4K30. The camera would often crap out and completely crash when trying to record a 4K video, which is kind of a bummer.</p>

<p>On the software front, it would have been nice to see Motorola give the phone more Moto AI features, even if they're cloud-based, although at $400, this isn't really something we should expect from a device at this price point.</p><p>Similarly, with Motorola's software promise, which admittedly could be better. We've seen the company offer a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/motorola-moto-g75-5g-rugged-phone-review">mid-range G-series phone</a> five OS upgrades and six years of software updates, and it would be nice to see that level of support on what could be considered the company's "hero" Moto G phone in North America.</p>

<p>Finally, while its nice to still have a stylus phone other than Samsung's premium Galaxy S25 Ultra, it feels a bit laggy, even after Motorola alleged to improve responsiveness by 4X.</p><p>I do like that Motorola finally gave it some purpose by adding the Sketch to Image feature, but I can't help but wonder if Motorola would be better off including an active stylus like an S Pen for potentially better usability or just doing away with it altogether and giving us a bigger battery or something.</p>

<p>At this price point, the closest competitor for the Moto G Stylus 2025 would be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Samsung Galaxy A36</a>. Because it's Samsung, you're getting a much better software promise and some fun built-in AI features like Object Eraser. However, charging speed is still slower, the screen isn't as sharp, there's less base RAM, and you don't get expandable storage.</p><p>You could also spring for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> if you don't mind spending a little more. This way, you could get a better software promise, more color options, and tons of AI features. However, it costs $100 more, and you'll miss out on the faster charging speeds.</p><p>You could also go for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a or Phone 3a Pro</a>, both of which are similarly priced and have impressive specs. However, they may also be hard to get a hold of as they're only available through Nothing's beta program, and carrier support isn't as robust or reliable.</p>

<p>Think about a phone that you know is coming but hasn't been announced just yet. Whether you're thinking of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-google-pixel-10-rumor-hints-at-pricing-changes">Pixel 10</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Z Fold 7</a>, or any other phone, one of the specifications you'll see people asking about is how fast it charges. Why?</p><p>The obvious answer is so we get more use out of it. We all know the battery isn't going to last the promised amount of time because it never does, and to keep using the phone we're going to need to charge the battery. If we can do that faster, we're able to do more.</p>
<p>But the real answer isn't as simple: it's the only way phone makers can address the problem right now. Monkeying around with a smarter charging circuit is easier — and cheaper — than fixing the root cause: we need batteries to get "better."</p>
<p>That means what you think it means and what you probably aren’t thinking of. Ideally, a phone manufacturer would find a way to build a device that looks good, is waterproof, and has a way to easily change the battery when it goes dead. That’s never going to happen, and maybe it shouldn’t — sealed “soft” batteries are safer and have higher capacity than older hard and removable batteries.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Q9TmqfkQgaSaymw3FWzGQ" name="Anker-Prime-battery-plugged-in.jpg" alt="An Anker Prime 27500mAh battery pack charging up multiple devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Q9TmqfkQgaSaymw3FWzGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The next best solution would be a battery that's simply a lot bigger. We see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">these unicorn devices</a> every once in a while, packing a battery that's big enough to last all day for everyone. Those devices are also usually thicker, so they're not proposed as the most premium flagship design from the manufacturer. Maybe they should be.</p>
<p>Finally, you have the battery technology itself. The types of batteries used in most phones today are designed to be high capacity compared to their small size, charge quickly, and are relatively long-lasting. They're good — way better than older stuff, and if you've been using battery-powered devices for a long time, you know it firsthand. But technology has improved, and it's possible to build a battery that's a lot better in the ways that matter. It's also more expensive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ViNkhhFKCSzyoztkyqLXoQ" name="oneplus-13-battery-life-02" alt="OnePlus 13 battery life at 70% charge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ViNkhhFKCSzyoztkyqLXoQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The easy fix comes from companies that spend a little money to find ways to charge faster while still being safe. Thankfully, people haven't stopped looking into better ways to fix it all.</p>
<p>Developing better ways to manage power consumption and optimize charging is part of that. Faster charging is a good thing as long as the side effects (battery degradation and efficiency) are hit too hard. Current battery technology is also something companies are fiddling with, altering the liquid used inside of them and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/stories/oppo-find-x8-series-battery/" target="_blank">the materials used</a> for the anode and cathode, and this can help.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ViJ2uokj2nwsGnQXfcdk8n" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-11" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 with a charging cable attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ViJ2uokj2nwsGnQXfcdk8n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3962" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Batteries in 2025 are a lot better than they were in 2015. That's good because the devices are also a lot more power-hungry than they were in 2015. But it does create a situation where it seems like battery development is stagnant. If you develop a battery that has double the density (ability to store a set amount of power), you can cut its size in half to get the same result. Companies don't want to build a phone that's a brick, and a battery that's physically smaller makes that easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fanz2BcmypJMCMbjNNavfL" name="OPPO-Find-N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fanz2BcmypJMCMbjNNavfL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2400" height="1350" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OPPO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One day, a company will build mainstream consumer devices that use something different. It might be a graphene-based battery, or use sodium instead of lithium, or even a solid-state battery. There are even companies exploring the use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/gadgets/article/3253660/how-samsung-apple-honor-and-more-are-pushing-smartphone-battery-tech-next-level">nuclear power to build a battery that lasts 50 years</a> once it's charged.</p><p>I am fascinated by all this, and I love to nerd out reading about advances in battery density and efficiency. I can't wait until we see technology like solid-state battery development for small devices that makes our current tech look terrible in comparison.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.23%;"><img id="hmUwSUDCqugmHHEDKrv9eb" name="radionuclide-battery.jpg" alt="Nuclear battery schematics" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hmUwSUDCqugmHHEDKrv9eb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="864" height="434" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Betavolt Technology)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also know that none of us wants to pay even more for a phone. They are already expensive, with some models hitting that $2,000 price point, so adding another $100 because of the R&D costs of a new battery type will never fly.</p><p>Unfortunately, faster charging is the best solution we have right now. It won't always be that way because EV companies will usher in some sort of new battery tech that lasts longer and isn't cost-prohibitive. Until then, we want to spend less time with a cord hanging off the end of our phone, so faster charging speeds are what we get.</p><p>As long as everything is done in a way that's safe, this isn't a problem, though in the long run, it does shorten the lifespan of the battery itself.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s AI department has roped in Mark D’Arcy, a seasoned marketing executive who cut his teeth at Meta and Time Warner, to help shape the future of Copilot AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-hires-former-meta-marketing-exec-work-copilot-ai" target="_blank">The Information</a> reports.</p><p>The move signals Microsoft’s push to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-default-assistant-beta-rollout">make Copilot not just smart</a>, but also the kind of AI assistant you’d actually want to shoot the breeze with.</p><p>D’Arcy has spent a decade at Meta helping big brands create eye-catching campaigns across Facebook, Instagram, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a>. Before that, he was the chief creative officer at Time Warner.</p>
<h2 id="from-ads-to-ai-2">From ads to AI</h2>
<p>Now he is rolling up his sleeves at Microsoft, reporting directly to Mustafa Suleyman, who is in charge of the company’s consumer AI division.</p><p>Suleyman has been vocal about crafting an AI that’s more empathetic than your average cold, calculating bot. Microsoft’s Copilot might not be as famous as ChatGPT (yet), but the software giant has been making moves. You can find it built into Windows, Bing, and Edge, and Microsoft even dropped a Super Bowl ad last year to get it on people’s radar.</p><p>Still, Copilot’s market share is sitting under 5%, while OpenAI’s ChatGPT is dominating with over 80%, based on Similarweb's data, as noted by The Information.</p><p>That’s where D’Arcy comes in. His mission is to make Copilot more relatable.</p>

<p>D’Arcy is stepping in to get Microsoft’s engineers, designers, and ad folks rowing in the same direction. At the top of his list is giving Copilot the marketing juice it needs to really take off.</p><p>Last month, Microsoft rolled out some fresh upgrades to Copilot, including a new feature that remembers key stuff from your past chats.</p><p>D’Arcy hasn’t said much publicly, but behind the scenes, he’s expected to work closely with designers and engineers to help Copilot find its voice. It’s a big bet, but with all the tech giants racing to win the AI race, Microsoft is clearly hoping that giving Copilot some heart and style will help it stand out in the crowd.</p>

Although the precise timing of the update notification remains unclear, the image hints that the update came along with this month's security patch.</p><p>The tipster also posted screenshots of new watch faces with the UI update that allows users to change fonts and other complications on them. They also shared a video of the improved interface with the One UI 8 update, showing apps like the Weather app opening and closing much faster and smoother.</p><p>Beyond that, a blur effect appeared when the user attempted to access media, revealing options for viewing it.

This pushes the need for users to update their phones immediately to avoid possible hacking or security breaches on their devices.</p><p>Another important aspect of this patch is that it updates the device's bootloader to include anti-rollback measures, which will not allow users to revert to older versions of Android 15 on their devices, possibly due to the above-mentioned security exploit.</p><p>The tech giant says that the rollout of the update will continue over the next week, varying based on carrier and device model.</p>

<ul><li>The Onn 4K Plus is an upcoming Google TV-powered streaming device priced under $30, as revealed by a leaked Walmart listing.</li><li>The key features of the device include a quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, Wi-Fi 6, Dolby Vision Atmos, Google Assistant, Google Cast, and smart home control capabilities.</li><li>This affordable device appears to be a viable replacement for the discontinued Chromecast with Google TV (4K), potentially undercutting competitors.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Walmart has some decent replacements for Google’s Chromecasts with its set of Onn streaming devices. Now, a new listing (now removed) revealed a supposedly upcoming streaming device dubbed Onn 4K Plus.</p><p>The pulled-out listing (spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/07/walmart-onn-4k-plus-google-tv-listing-price/">9to5Google</a>) showcases the upcoming Onn 4K Plus streaming device, which features Google TV and has an attractive price retailing just under $30. The publication further notes that the same streaming device was leaked through some photos early last month, as it was accidentally posted on a review site.</p>

<p>However, the new Walmart listing reveals the device in full, including pricing, and more of what to expect. The Onn 4K Plus features a quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of storage. It further provides Wi-Fi 6 support. Additionally, the streaming device supports Google Assistant, Google Cast, Dolby Vision Atmos certification, and HDMI.</p><p>Users will be able to perform smart home control tasks like handling lights and thermostats connected to the same network, as it appears the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/chromecast/chromecast-with-google-tv-home-panel-feature-rollout">Google Home panel</a> is a highlighted feature.</p>
<h2 id="an-affordable-4k-streaming-device-2">An affordable 4K streaming device</h2>
<p>Since it's Google TV, one can find dedicated buttons on the remote to trigger Google Assistant and Free TV, as well as launch buttons for streaming services like YouTube, Netflix, Disney Plus, and Paramount Plus.</p><p>The new Onn 4K Plus joins the other two 4K <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-devices">streaming devices</a> the company already provides — the Onn 4K streaming (2023) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/walmart-onn-google-tv-4k-pro-review">4K Pro streaming (2024)</a>.

<hr>
<p>The highly anticipated Galaxy S25 Edge finally got a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-gearing-up-to-launch-the-galaxy-s25-edge-next-week">launch date</a>, and it is coming next week. However, it still isn’t stopping the leaks, as marketing materials for the upcoming slim phone have now surfaced.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge">Android Headlines</a> has managed to grab official-looking marketing material of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> alongside renders of its official accessories, which gives us a clear picture of what to expect. While we have already seen the actual device at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series launch and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC 2025</a>, very little about the device is known until now.</p>

<p>The leaked materials indicate a slimmer design, which is said to be “ultra sleek and premium,” and at least three colorways are expected: black, silver, and a possible blue hue. Even with the slimmer form factor, the device boasts a durable design with a titanium finish and features an ultra-tough glass protection on both sides of the handset. The durability here also includes an IP68 rating, which means it should notably feature solid dust and water resistance.</p><p>On the back, the S25 Edge marks a departure from the conventional triple camera array as seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">S25 Plus</a> models. It comes with a new dual camera visor, and the latest leak showcases that it is a 200MP primary lens, which is a wide-angle camera with 2x optical quality zoom paired with a 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens. For selfies, the device will have a 12MP shooter.</p><p>The materials, however, still don't specify the processor and the battery capacity, but instead hint at them being a powerful processor and an all-day battery promise despite being the slimmest Galaxy phone.</p>

<p>Alongside the specs, the accessories accompanying the upcoming Galaxy S25 Edge may include silicone cases in black, blue, and gray color variants. Additionally, users can also expect Samsung’s popular Kindsuit cases in blue, light gray, and gray color options. Lastly, there’s also a transparent case that could go with the Galaxy S25 Edge next to an anti-reflective screen protector as well.</p><p>As mentioned, the Galaxy S25 Edge will be launched early next week, May 12 at 8 p.m. ET, to be precise. It will be a virtual Galaxy Unpacked event, and consumers can already reserve the Galaxy S25 Edge. Those who opt in will receive a $50 Samsung credit.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I was excited when I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k9-pro-ess-review">started using the K9 Pro</a> three years ago; the high-end DAC had everything I needed, and it did a great job driving my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-lcd-x-review">Audeze LCD-X</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/massdrop-x-focal-elex-review">Focal Elex</a>. With the flagship K19, Fiio proved that it could deliver something that held its own against the best in this category.</p><p>Now we have the K17. This is billed as the upgrade to the K9 Pro, and it comes with AKM's latest AK4191EX and AK4499EQ DACs, along with a custom amp that delivers 4000mW of power, and all the analog and digital connectors you need. The K17 costs $899, but because of the tariffs, the price has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-K17-Headphone-Amplifier-AK4499EX/dp/B0DTJ86XF6">increased to $949 on Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>While it's good to see the internals get a refresh, what I like the most about the K17 is the design; Fiio went with retro styling, and the DAC looks absolutely stunning. It has a white color scheme with chunky dials and knobs, and a 3.93-inch color LCD panel with a 240x1020 resolution, and LED lights on the knobs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="UFKDJozy5b5RSYr77WvwSE" name="Fiio K17" alt="Fiio K17 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UFKDJozy5b5RSYr77WvwSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio rolled out utilitarian designs in the past, and while the K9 Pro had plenty to offer, it doesn't hold a candle to the K17 in terms of the design aesthetic. Fiio did a fantastic job in this regard, and I like the K17's design better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">K19</a>. There are vents at the sides as well as the top, and you get better cooling — this was an issue on the K9 Pro.</p>

<p>The dials at the front let you change modes and adjust gain easily, and the menu system is significantly easier to navigate this time around. You get the usual 6.35mm, 4.4mm, and XLR connectors, and there's a USB-C in up front that allows you to easily connect to source devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kWZ6aGK8vkraSMbX49ZA4E" name="Fiio K17" alt="Fiio K17 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kWZ6aGK8vkraSMbX49ZA4E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's something about the tactility that you get with using large buttons and dials that's just missing digitally; this is a clear point of differentiation with the K17, and a big reason why I like the DAC so much. Just like the K19, you get a remote control that makes it easier to change modes, adjust volume, tweak EQ, and mute the device. The remote itself is identical, with the only difference being that the Bluetooth button is missing in spite of the unit having the same Bluetooth 5.1 modem.</p>

<p>Round the back, there's USB-C in, USB-A, Gigabit Ethernet, line in and line out, balanced XLR out, coaxial in and out along with optical in/out. There really isn't anything missing when it comes to connectivity, and Fiio deserves credit in this area. Similar to the K9 Pro, you get a voltage toggle at the back that lets you switch between 110V and 230V (I used the latter as I'm in India).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="h2wviDYyG8ifE7PCQMWnQE" name="Fiio K17" alt="Fiio K17 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2wviDYyG8ifE7PCQMWnQE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio is once again offering the 31-band PEQ feature that debuted on the K19, and it is just as effective. It uses an M21586Q DSP and ES9821Q ADC, and you get granular control when it comes to tweaking the sound. It has the same QCC5125 Bluetooth modem, and this time, Fiio went with a discrete amp solution that's driven by the Onsemi MJE243G and MJE253G.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="EuPZmKE2Dig45RhDHxpM7E" name="Fiio K17" alt="Fiio K17 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EuPZmKE2Dig45RhDHxpM7E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5016" height="2825" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Clearly, a lot of thought went into the design and internals of the K17, and the final result is a DAC that's much better than the K9 Pro. A cool feature is the ability to play music when you connect a USB drive or HDD to the DAC — no other source needed. The DAC handles PCM up to 768kHz/32-bit and DSD512 natively, and 384kHz/32-bit and DSD256 when using a local source. Oh, and it is Roon ready, making it a great choice if you use the platform.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="iFmmTKABZph7b2Rsvonw7E" name="Fiio K17" alt="Fiio K17 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iFmmTKABZph7b2Rsvonw7E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5105" height="2875" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the ability to deliver 4000mW of power at 32Ω over the balanced 4.4mm connector and 1850mW at 32Ω via the single-ended 6.35mm port, the K17 is able to drive any headset with relative ease. I didn't see any issues with the Audeze LCD-X, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze MM-500</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">Fiio FT5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fa19-review">Fiio FA19 IEMs</a>, and the Focal Elex.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Jtka9gCFnygVaNfUc68KoE" name="Fiio K17" alt="Fiio K17 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jtka9gCFnygVaNfUc68KoE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the K19, the K17 has a neutral soundstage that doesn't add any dynamics to the sound, allowing headsets and IEMs to shine. It was delightful to use the DAC with the FT5 and the recent FT1 Pro, with both delivering an energetic bass, clearly-defined mids, and a smooth treble. The K17 nails the technicalities, and you get accurate imaging and great resolution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4861px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MP6LvXKJfi4HUfBMJ2d36E" name="Fiio K17" alt="Fiio K17 DAC review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MP6LvXKJfi4HUfBMJ2d36E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4861" height="2738" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After testing over a dozen Fiio DACs, I can safely say that the K17 is its best yet. I like the design better than the K19, and if anything, the K17 sounds better when using the same headsets. Overall, this is an excellent upgrade to the K9 Pro, and if you need a DAC that looks as good as it sounds, this is definitely the one to get.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-52">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung is fast-tracking Galaxy S25 production, adding 800,000 more units this May, mostly the Ultra model.</li><li>There are 1.5 million units planned for the S25 Ultra, with the regular S25 and Plus at 1.3 million and 500,000, respectively.</li><li>Samsung is racing to ship these units before the Trump administration could impose tariffs on smartphones, though the government hasn't confirmed this.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung isn't waiting around to see what Washington cooks up next. The company is firing up production lines to crank out an extra 800,000 Galaxy S25s this month, with a big focus on the top-tier S25 Ultra.</p><p>Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=5258" target="_blank">The Elec</a> reports that Samsung is hitting the gas on smartphone production (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-increases-galaxy-s25-production-tariffs-3555681/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). The company has reportedly told suppliers that it is aiming to build 15.8 million smartphones, including 3.3 million <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> units, up from 2.5 million last month.</p><p>For May’s Galaxy S25 lineup, Samsung is putting the spotlight on the Ultra, with 1.5 million units in the pipeline. The regular S25 follows with 1.3 million, and the Plus rounds things out with 500,000.</p>
<h2 id="tariff-talk-is-heating-up-2">Tariff talk is heating up</h2>
<p>Lately, talk around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/donald-trump-exempts-phones-chips-from-new-tariffs">tariffs and trade rules has been heating up</a>, indicating major shifts in how imports are handled in the U.S. In response, companies are raising prices, moving production around, and rushing shipments to beat any new deadlines.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hn8GRZomrhbxLDNov8YUS7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-12" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hn8GRZomrhbxLDNov8YUS7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the moment, there’s a 90-day window giving companies a breather from these tariffs, and Samsung is wasting no time. The company is clearly trying to get as much out the door as possible before the break ends and the costs kick in.</p><p>The real headache with the whole tariff mess is how unpredictable it is. After months of trade tension bubbling over, we’ve seen some serious tariffs hit, especially targeting Asian countries that do a lot of the world’s manufacturing.</p><p>Some of these charges are light-ish at 10%, but others skyrocket up to a wild 145% on certain Chinese goods. That kind of rollercoaster makes it nearly impossible for companies to plan ahead.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-is-playing-it-smart-2">Samsung is playing it smart</h2>
<p>When the rules keep shifting with no warning, it’s less about smart strategy and more about staying on your toes. Samsung’s current scramble to pump out and ship devices while the coast is clear is a classic example.</p><p>Right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung devices</a> are still in the clear. But with trade rules changing at the drop of a hat, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-tariffs-are-a-great-reason-to-keep-the-phone-you-have-as-long-as-you-can">playing it safe makes a lot of sense</a>.</p><p>According to The Elec, Samsung is aiming to roll out a hefty 16.2 million smartphones and tablets this May alone.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qGD8Fn8ecjU6sko2Pt7Ny8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-13" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qGD8Fn8ecjU6sko2Pt7Ny8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the FT1 Pro, it's clear that Fiio took all of its learnings in the last two years to create a product that truly stands out. The headphones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-FT1-Pro-Headphones-Sensitivity/dp/B0DM61CHW6">cost $279 on Amazon</a>, with the regular FT1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-FT1-Closed-Back-Headphones-Detachable/dp/B0D9QD4Y2P">going up to $209</a> on the retailer due to the ongoing tariffs situation. Even then, they're a decent value when you consider just how good they sound.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="tkNsJ8zGyQXAarBThRVkU8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-4" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tkNsJ8zGyQXAarBThRVkU8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The FT1 Pro share a similar aesthetic as the rest of their siblings, and while you don't get a wood-backed design like the FT1, they're comfortable to wear, and don't cause any fatigue even with extended use. Coming in at 374g, they're not heavy, and Fiio did a good job with the suede headband lining and liberal usage of steel in the construction of the headphones.</p>

<p>The headband allows for a good rotation, and I didn't see any issues in getting a comfortable fit. The protein leather pads come with a fabric lining, and the breathable design ensures there's no hot spot while using the FT1 Pro. The pads are slightly angled, and they fit well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EEfFJ6uE2d5DwqXbaDtuU8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-11" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EEfFJ6uE2d5DwqXbaDtuU8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The FT1 Pro connect via 3.5mm jacks, and Fiio bundles two cables in the box; one with a 3.5mm plug, and the other being a balanced 4.4mm cable. Like the FT1, you get a high-quality storage box that makes it easy to take the FT1 Pro anywhere.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YUUp9xY9eGPevdnJEQZiz8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-14" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YUUp9xY9eGPevdnJEQZiz8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the FT1 Pro use Fiio's custom planar drivers, and combined wit the open-back nature of the headphones, you get a distinctly different sound to the regular model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rFDxfQKC5d95yprqNkfkh8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-17" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rFDxfQKC5d95yprqNkfkh8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The FT1 have a clearly exaggerated bass with a distinct rumble and energy, and the FT1 Pro have a better balance; the bass isn't quite as vibrant, but you still get plenty of vigor, and the switch to planar drivers means the bass transient is faster. If you predominantly listen to bass-heavy music, I'd still suggest the FT1 — they're designed to have a weighty low-end — but if you want a neutral sound while still getting decent bass, the FT1 Pro are the way to go.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kNRGtinLMTEF5GCzB5CJP8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-6" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kNRGtinLMTEF5GCzB5CJP8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mid-bass is tight and focused, and you get a clean mid-range where the vocals are detailed and full-bodied. Instruments have good tonality, and there's a bit of warmth to the sound that makes using the headphones highly enjoyable. This is where the FT1 Pro come into their own, and the sound quality is similar to the HD6XX but with the benefit of planar drivers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7cFxKPk2YLc9gMDhS7Rts8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-3" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cFxKPk2YLc9gMDhS7Rts8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a good sense of airiness with the treble, but you don't get any harshness or sibilance, which is good. The soundstage is definitely wider than the FT1 (as you'd imagine), and there's better imaging as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5174px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="eqgRykZURmZWgFvYMZcUJ8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-1" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eqgRykZURmZWgFvYMZcUJ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5174" height="2914" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The one thing to note is that the FT1 Pro need a powerful source — I tested them with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">Fiio K19</a> — and there was a noticeable difference in imaging when I switched to a portable source. So if you're eyeing these, I'd suggest using an amp that has a decent amount of power. It's not that they're hard to drive, but you'll need to good source to unlock the full potential of the sound.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7YQwmecaSmYGK79VpjZue8" name="fiio-ft1-pro-12" alt="Fiio FT1 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7YQwmecaSmYGK79VpjZue8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, Fiio did a magnificent job with the FT1 Pro. They have a neutral sound that lends itself well to diverse genres, and you get a comfortable fit. While they're costlier in the U.S. because of the tariffs, they're still a good option if you want a planar headset on a budget.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini Live is rolling out for work and school users on Google Workspace domains.</li><li>The feature is automatically enabled when Gemini access is available, and Gemini Apps Activity must remain turned on.</li><li>Workspaces with the Gemini Apps add-on will share their data with Google to help improve AI features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Gemini Live first rolled out for personal Google accounts last year, but users with Google Workspace accounts for work or school couldn't access the handy feature. That's changing, as Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/05/gemini-live-in-depth-two-way-conversations.html" target="_blank">announced</a> today, May 9, that Gemini Live's conversation features are reaching the Gemini mobile app for Workspace customers. Users can now have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">multimodal conversations with Gemini Live</a> in real time, using their voice, camera, or screen.</p><p>Notably, administrators can't individually restrict access to Gemini Live for their employees or students. It is available by default when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> app access is enabled, with no admin control for Live specifically. Gemini Apps Activity is also automatically enabled when Gemini app access is permitted by a Workspace, and users can't manually delete their activity.</p><p>Gemini Live is restricted to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Workspace</a> users who are 18 years or older, so some student accounts may be unable to use it due to age requirements. For personal Google accounts, the minimum age to use Gemini is 13 years old.</p>

<p>Google outlines the differences in Gemini's privacy and data collection policies for work and school accounts in the blog post.</p><p>"Currently, if you use the Gemini web app or mobile app with your work or school account, your Gemini Apps Activity is turned on and your conversation history is retained for 18 months," the post explains.</p><p>Even if you delete Gemini chats, the data is still saved in your Gemini Apps Activity on Google servers.</p><p>"For work users who have access to Gemini Apps as an additional service, while Gemini Apps Activity is on, Google collects your Gemini Apps conversations and other information you provide to improve and develop Google products and services and machine-learning technologies," the post continues.</p><p>The rollout is beginning today for all Google Workspace domains, but it could take up to 15 days for full feature visibility. It's available for the following Google Workspace plans and add-ons:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Business</strong> Starter, Standard, Plus</li><li><strong>Enterprise </strong>Starter, Standard, Plus</li><li><strong>Education</strong> Fundamentals, Standard, and Plus</li><li><strong>Frontline</strong> Starter and Standard</li><li><strong>Nonprofits</strong></li><li><strong>Essentials, Enterprise Essentials, and Enterprise Essentials Plus</strong></li><li><strong>Gemini Add-ons</strong><ul><li>Gemini <strong>Business</strong></li><li>Gemini <strong>Enterprise</strong></li><li>Gemini <strong>Education</strong></li><li>Gemini <strong>Education Premium</strong></li></ul></li></ul>
<p>The expanded Gemini Live availability comes ahead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O 2025</a>, a developer conference happening this month that will surely involve AI and Workspace features.</p>

<ul><li>The U.S. DOJ won its antitrust case against Google, but the two sides recently finished their remedies hearing, where each made their case as to what changes Google should have to make to its business.</li><li>The DOJ wants Google to cease promotional deals involving Google Search and to divest the Chrome browser.</li><li>Google is responding to the government's proposals by calling them "extreme," and saying they would "hurt consumers."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A U.S. District Court judge ruled in August 2024 that Google's search engine dominance was attributed to antitrust violations, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-pulse-google-is-now-a-monopoly-but-nothing-will-really-change">saying that "Google is a monopolist."</a> That isn't the end of the high-profile antitrust case between the U.S. government and Google, however.</p><p>Now, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Google are both sharing proposed remedies with Judge Amit Mehta, who will eventually decide what measures the company will need to take to correct its monopoly. Following the weeks-long remedies hearing, the DOJ recommended the court <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-be-forced-to-split-up-chrome-and-android-over-antitrust-concerns">require Google to divest Chrome</a> — its browser with close ties to Google Search — and cease promotional agreements that put Search in the hands of users.</p><p>Google now has a public response to the DOJ's proposed remedies. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-may-2025/" target="_blank">blog post</a> published today, May 9, the company called the government's remedies "extreme." Google claims being forced to sell Chrome and stop creating promotional agreements for Search would "hurt consumers and America's tech leadership."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we wrapped our case in the DOJ search remedies trial. Some key points from court this week ⬇️<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1920613963244372406">May 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Specifically, Google pushes back on the concept that promotional agreements for Search are inherently anti-competitive. This is largely in reference to Google's deal with Apple, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-seeks-to-defend-google-search-distribution-deal">was brought up during the trial</a>. This promotional agreement in particular pays Apple $20 billion annually to make Google Search the default browser on iPhone.</p><p>The DOJ wants these payments to stop, but Google says these kinds of deals are simply part of the evolving nature of competition. The company cites Apple's deal with OpenAI and Motorola's deal with Perplexity and Microsoft as evidence of other brands taking similar steps to get their products in the hands of users.</p>

<p>During the trial and remedies hearings, brands paid by Google to make Search the default search engine took defense of the Mountain View-based company. Apple's Senior Vice President of Services Eddy Cue told the court that AI is already making Google less of an antitrust threat. Additionally, Mozilla executives said that without Google's search payments, Firefox would be "put out of business"</p><p>Meanwhile, the blog post claims divesting Chrome "would break it" and make it "a shadow of the current Chrome," in Google's view.</p><p>The conclusion of the remedies hearing in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">United States of America v. Google</a> means that we're one step closer to learning what changes Google will have to make to its business. Judge Mehta has now heard arguments from both the DOJ and Google as to what those measures will be, and is expected to order remedies this summer.</p>

<hr>
<p>The streaming service, Max, is reportedly preparing to officially kick off its crackdown on users who are sharing passwords.</p><p>In a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/max-password-sharing-more-assertive-blocking-users-1236390795/">Variety</a>, the publication cites Warner Bros. Discovery CEO and president of global streaming and games, JB Perrette, when stating 2025 is the year for its strong crackdown on password sharing. During the company's Q1 report, Perrette reportedly stated its efforts against sharing accounts will be gradual.</p><p>Perrette said Max will begin displaying messages to users "softly" before becoming more "visible to subscribers over the months to come." What's more, the company states Max will become "more assertive" in its urge to push users away from password sharing "over the course of the back half of the year and really into ’26."</p><p>As the publication also notes, Max's CEO (and the service in general) is encouraging users into its recently launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.max.com/us/Answer/Detail/000002598">Extra Members add-on</a>.</p><p>Account owners can pay an additional $7.99 per month to share their subscription with someone who doesn't live in their household. Those who do not comply will face repercussions, such as disabled features. More importantly, WBD's Perrette states the full crackdown on password sharing will take anywhere from a year to 18 months to complete.</p>

<p>WBD's Max first highlighted its interest in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/max-prepares-password-sharing-crackdown">password sharing crackdown</a> early last year. Perrette was a part of those formal announcements in 2024, stating, "We think, relative to the scale of our business, it’s a meaningful opportunity." At its core, Max saw the success <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix/netflix-stock-plummet-password-sharing">services like Netflix</a> had with its crackdown and eventual implementation of extra members.</p><p>Those details came off the back of Max's striking loss of $55 million in Q4 2023.</p><p>A few months later, in December 2024, Perrette <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/max-password-sharing-crackdown-to-begin-details">returned to tease</a> a much stronger crackdown in 2025. Much of what's been confirmed by Perrette through Variety echoes what was said late last year. Max's interest in starting gently before becoming more "assertive" and its Netflix-like extra members add-on, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/max/max-launches-extra-member-add-799mo-across-subscription-tiers-us">debuted last month</a>. We've seen much of the same roll in for the likes of Disney Plus and Hulu, as well, so Max following the trend hasn't been a surprise.</p><p>Generating more revenue can be seen a core driver for this, given Max has stated such outright in the past. However, Variety highlights its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-adds-5-3-million-streaming-subscribers-q1-loss-1236390685/">Q1 2025 analytics</a>, which shows Max gained over 5 million subscribers, helping it cut down on its major losses.</p>

<ul><li>Google recently highlighted the launch of AI-powered warnings in Chrome for Android.</li><li>Thanks to Gemini's intelligence and on-device machine learning, Google says Android users will receive alerts about potential scams through notifications.</li><li>Google updated Chrome's Safety Check on Android last September, giving it improved background tasks and an early version of notification alerts.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's starting to rollout a new security feature on Android that'll help ward off malicious threats when browsing.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/how-were-using-ai-to-combat-the-latest-scams/">Keyword post</a>, Google highlighted the new lengths it's going to protect its Chrome for Android users, thanks to machine learning. Its software will now hone in on "scams, spam, and unwanted notifications" from malicious websites. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.chromium.org/2025/05/fighting-unwanted-notifications-with.html">subsequent blog post</a> explains Chrome will soon leverage a local, on-device machine learning model to "analyze" website notifications.</p><p>Much of this model's prowess comes from Gemini. Essentially, Google states the model's available synthetic data, which it used for training, was "evaluated against real notifications Chrome security team collected by subscribing to a variety of websites."</p><p>If Chrome on Android has flagged a notification as malicious, users will see the site's name, a caution icon, and a message warning them against interacting with it. Chrome will then offer two options: Unsubscribe and Show Notification.</p><p>Chrome's AI-backed intelligence could've gotten things wrong, which is the reason behind the Show Notification option. Users can still see what it deems malicious and tell it otherwise if the alert is fine.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:572px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:104.90%;"><img id="ELnUDkaAtMGEWoXdBGBGQd" name="google-chrome-android-malicious-notification-alert-gemini" alt="An example of Google Chrome on Android's malicious notification alert, fueled by Gemini and machine learning intelligence." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ELnUDkaAtMGEWoXdBGBGQd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="572" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>These malicious notification protections hit Android (mobile) first; however, Google says it will look into expanding its coverage in the future.</p><p>Additionally, Google highlighted Gemini Nano's assistance with Chrome's Enhanced Protection mode on desktop. The company states it's already using the AI to help protect users from tech support scams when browsing. Gemini Nano gives users "instant" insight into risky websites, which enables the browser to better protect users.</p><p>Google adds that it will look into bringing these capabilities to Android, as well as the ability to combat more scam types.</p><p>Last September, Google announced a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-safety-check-defense-boost-android">major Safety Check update</a> for its Android Chrome users. Safety Check's background tasks were updated to ensure you're running the latest browser software and the ability to scan your passwords for potential security risks. Moreover, Safety Check will consider your installed extensions (on desktop) and warn you if any of them are working against you.</p><p>Interestingly, the company previously highlighted Chrome's ability on Android to check for potentially dangerous notifications. However, given the recent updates to the function with Gemini and the inclusion of on-device machine learning, this ability is picking up a noteworthy enhancement to combat scams and more types of spam.</p>

<hr>
<p>Rumors end the week with speculation on Samsung's supposed changes for the Galaxy Watch 8 series.</p><p>Alongside tipster AssembleDebug, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-squircle-design-quick-button-apk-teardown-3555946/">Android Authority</a> states Samsung's early One UI 8 code holds clues about the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series. Specifically, the post highlights the current animation images within the software, which showcase the addition of a "Quick" button for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Watch 8</a> Classic. This change reportedly takes the Classic's physical button tally to three, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>.</p><p>While the leaked graphics don't show this button for the base Watch 8, the imagery highlights another significant change: an Ultra-like redesign.</p><p>The tipster discovered that the Galaxy Watch 8 (codename "Fresh 8") and the Watch 8 Classic ("Wise 8") feature a squircle design similar to Samsung's 2024 Ultra model. "Squircle" concerns a watch's square base with a circular watch face on top. While both models reportedly sport this new shape, they're not equal.</p><p>The leaked image suggests the Watch 8 could have slimmer bezels, while the Watch 8 Classic could be slightly thicker. This is something we've seen happen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 and 6 Classic</a>. Moreover, it's unclear if Samsung has retained the rotating bezels on the Classic (though there's hope).</p>

<p>Lastly, the publication purports the 8 Classic could get an upgrade to its vibration pattern support. In short, this might make its vibrations a little stronger, furthering suspicions around a more Ultra-like model.</p><p>The latest leak is pretty substantial in terms of the Watch 8 series' outlook; however, in early April, the pair reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/new-leak-hints-at-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8s-existence">showed up in SafetyKorea's database</a>. Samsung was reportedly spotted passing its next series through its certification loops, which brought the existence of a pair of watches to our attention. The battery model numbers in the database were EB-BL330ABY and EB-BL505ABY for the Watch 8 and 8 Classic, respectively.</p><p>The reported battery size of the former is 435mAh, leaving the capacity of the other unknown for now.</p><p>A recent leak from earlier this week touched on the expected Gemini integration in Wear OS, but through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/alleged-one-ui-8-watch-leak-samsung-gemini-actions">eyes of One UI 8 Watch</a>. A teardown showed Google is preparing to bring Gemini "Actions" to its wearable software, which will likely wind up on Samsung's next-generation watches. Several strings suggest Gemini can help users move items on their calendars, summarize emails, and more.</p><p>Samsung is expected to debut its Galaxy Watch 8 series during its summer Unpacked.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>When you look at the Galaxy S25 lineup, Samsung has pretty much reached the peak. It's partially why I think the company is even venturing down a "new" path with the upcoming Galaxy S25 Edge; there's nowhere else to go. However, the same can't be said about either the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold or Z Flip lineups</a>.</p><p>We still don't have flagship cameras in a phone that costs around $2,000, plus battery life is good for a couple of months and then becomes fear-inducing. Not to mention that the paltry battery takes forever to charge, because Samsung is still seemingly afraid of offering charging speeds faster than 25W. That's despite the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> supporting up to 45W chargers, which is still far behind much of the competition.</p>

<p>Oh, and that same competition already figured out how to ditch the crease, while Samsung continues acting like having the Grand Canyon in the middle of a screen is okay. At the same time, it's making appearances at different events and conferences to showcase the kinds of upgrades that I've been begging for.</p><p>That pretty much covers the meat and potatoes of my frustrations with what Samsung has done, or really hasn't done, over the past couple of years. So, with all of that in mind, I've been finding it increasingly difficult to get even remotely excited about the prospect of a tri-fold (bi-fold?) from Samsung.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uxXRHZUDqc8RXw9JWFUXtH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uxXRHZUDqc8RXw9JWFUXtH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Every time I see a picture or video of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>, I'm immediately put in a sort of trance, just because it looks absolutely beautiful. Then, reality sets in, and I'm forced to be reminded of where I live and that the Mate XT isn't actually viable for me.</p><p>Frankly, I don't know if I have the confidence that Samsung can come anywhere near what the Mate XT offers. Well, I take that back. I believe that Samsung is fully capable of designing a phone that's even better than Huawei, but would only do so as a limited release (i.e., the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="5w4UFrBYVuRungQLtvcQc5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-promo-render.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5w4UFrBYVuRungQLtvcQc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="506" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm suspecting that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-teases-a-wild-new-foldable-phone-dropping-in-late-2025">Galaxy "G" Fold</a> will look fairly similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Z Fold 6</a>, just with an extra hinge and wider screen. That's to say it'll be awkward, chunky, and while the software will probably be pretty solid, the hardware will leave a bit to be desired.</p><p>It's pretty obvious that Samsung has become complacent. It made massive leaps and improvements before some companies even got started, only to follow that up with a series of iterative updates, following the same cadence that we see with traditional slab phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.00%;"><img id="5aYjNxDSmKsCaigNapZpbF" name="Samsung-Flex-G" alt="Samsung Flex G" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5aYjNxDSmKsCaigNapZpbF.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="392" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Etnews)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, it's not like Samsung doesn't have an opportunity here to reassert its position as a leader in the foldable space. And what better way to do so than with the launch of a completely new product?</p><p>There have been a few leaks that give us an idea of what to expect from the Galaxy G Fold, much of which suggests it will share some DNA with the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PandaFlashPro">@PandaFlashPro</a>, the hinge mechanism is "similar," while the "speakers drivers are the exact same."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8yVVWui3NnjnCSU96atTn4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8yVVWui3NnjnCSU96atTn4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, there is one thing that won't be the same, supposedly, and that's the crease. Samsung is rumored to finally give us an almost-crease-less display with the Fold 7 that matches up with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a>. Unfortunately, rumors point to this not being the case with the Galaxy G Fold, leaving me to assume that it will look more like the Fold 6. This will probably have an impact on potential sales for a phone that already has a steep hill to climb.</p><p>As for the software, if we ignore the debacle that has been the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-launch-messy">One UI 7 rollout</a>, I'm actually not worried about that. It might miss out on a few things here and there, but by and large, Samsung <em>arguably</em> offers the best foldable software experience. I'm sure there will be bugs and quirks, but it likely (hopefully) won't have many growing pains as we've seen in the past.</p>

<p>What I would <em>love</em> for Samsung to do is shock the world and put all of its available resources into designing the "ultimate" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>. A phone that truly has no compromises, meaning flagship camera hardware, a crease-less and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-friendly</a> tri-fold display, a larger and thinner battery that also charges faster, and hell, figure out a way to get the S Pen in there.</p><p>I have little doubt that there isn't already such a device hidden away in the depths of Samsung's R&D department. Such a phone will probably never see the light of day, as it doesn't make financial sense for Samsung to release a phone that will lose the company money. But if there's one company that <em>could</em> do something like that without worrying about many repercussions, it's Samsung.</p>

Where One UI 6 Watch felt relatively minor, One UI 8 Watch already feels like it's packing two years' worth of changes into one, and it has me really excited about what's to come for Samsung's Galaxy smartwatches.</p><p>While we can probably look forward to some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-squircle-design-quick-button-apk-teardown-3555946/">alleged design changes</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Watch 8 series</a>, Samsung may be focusing as much effort on software to help give its watches an edge this year. And after a relatively safe One UI 6 Watch update, this feels like the push it needs to shake things up..</p><p>Here's a relatively brief rundown of everything that has been rumored or leaked thus far regarding One UI 8 Watch:</p>
<h2 id="what-we-know-so-far-about-one-ui-8-watch-2">What we know so far about One UI 8 Watch</h2>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Wear OS Weekly</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o8KRGSTt4mbFxn3wdtWvtU" name="lloyd-wear-os-weekly.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot Lloyd wearing a Galaxy Watch and Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8KRGSTt4mbFxn3wdtWvtU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/wear-os-weekly">weekly column</a> focuses on the state of Wear OS, from new developments and updates to the latest apps and features we want to highlight.</p></div></div>
<p>First, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-one-ui-6-watch-to-one-ui-8-watch/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> reported that we'd skip from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5#section-one-ui-6-watch" target="_blank">One UI 6 Watch</a>, which focused on AI and health tools but made very few system-level changes, to One UI 8 Watch to align it with Galaxy phones' One UI 8.</p><p>Then we started seeing the real meat of the update. We knew Gemini was coming to Wear OS, but a leaked One UI 8 Watch build showed the option to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/alleged-one-ui-8-watch-leak-samsung-gemini-actions">add Gemini actions</a> linked to other apps like Gmail, Calendar, and Weather — beyond Assistant's current capabilities.</p><p>After that, Android Authority dove into this build's AFK and found evidence of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-now-bar-now-brief-galaxy-watch-3555509/">Now Bar and Now Brief coming to Wear OS</a>. It would default as a blank placeholder icon on your watch face until you use a "double-pinch" gesture to expand it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1901px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Fsutg9wGqLoKo8tMvXEvW3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Now-Bar" alt="An extracted image from One UI 8 Watch showing what the Now Bar on a Galaxy Watch will look like." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fsutg9wGqLoKo8tMvXEvW3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1901" height="1069" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An extracted image of the Now Bar in One UI 8 Watch </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung / Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to the code, the Now Bar on Wear OS can specifically show contextual suggestions, directions, media controls, the Now Brief, sports scores, and health updates. Just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar on Galaxy phones</a>, you'll be able to personalize it.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a> mention makes me wonder if we'll get a Wear OS-specific version of the current daily report on Galaxy phones when we wake up, similar to the Morning Report on Garmin watches or Morning Brief on Pixel smartwatches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="yECQ3QgpA9cDh4KRuu7M6k" name="morning-brief-weather-calendar-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Weather and Calendar in Morning Brief on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yECQ3QgpA9cDh4KRuu7M6k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:462px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.73%;"><img id="xuTS8gqam7uU8baYrrozAC" name="One-UI-8-Shortcuts-app-2x2-tile-AssembleDebug.jpg" alt="The upcoming Shortcuts app in One UI 8 Watch, showing four watch app icons in 2x2 formation for the Gallery, Weather, Calculator, and Samsung Health." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xuTS8gqam7uU8baYrrozAC.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="462" height="336" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung / Android Authority )</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond that, the APK teardown showed a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-app-shortcuts-one-ui-8-watch-3555500/">Shortcuts function</a> that lets you see two or four app icons directly on the One UI 8 Watch home screen. This seems a bit clunky compared to just swiping down for the app drawer, but some people will appreciate the immediate access.</p><p>On a more fun note, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-watch-random-face-3555351/">Shuffle Watch Face</a> tool will swap between your saved favorites, while the "Recommend watch face" option finds one with a "similar style to the watch face you're using" to try out. Samsung's watch faces <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/we-weighed-galaxy-vs-pixel-watch-for-best-wear-os-watch-faces">beat the other Wear OS brands</a> for quality <em>and</em> quantity, so any excuse to try out more faces is a good one.</p><p>There's probably even more data hidden in the code to uncover. The APK teardown even showed an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-watch-charge-limit-3555373/">adaptive charging tool</a> that freezes your Galaxy Watch battery at a custom percentage (like 95%) and then waits to restart charging until another custom value (like 50%).</p><p>Pixel Watches are also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-watches-should-soon-get-better-charging-tech">supposed to get adaptive charging soon</a>, so both brands' batteries will last longer without overcharging.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.97%;"><img id="RRQnekYhcCfDoP7UzSmjtC" name="Galaxy-Unpacked-Vascular-Load-example" alt="The Vascular load (Labs) submenu in Samsung Health that shows your heart's activity level from day to day, as well as a summary of the data: "Steady: Your vascular load is consistent.

<p>Even if we assume the dataminers have found everything hidden, there's still the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-more-excited-about-galaxy-unpacked-samsung-health-features-than-galaxy-s25">official Samsung Health AI tools</a> coming to Galaxy Watches this year, from Vascular Load and an AI Health Coach to the new antioxidant index and mood check-ins.</p><p>It's a relief to see Samsung going all-out on software because, so far, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> may not change much internally when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Watch 7</a>.</p><p>We don't have fully leaked renders yet, but the Galaxy Watch 8 has already passed through the FCC and Korean battery certification. All the publicly available data shows that the charging speed and Wi-Fi connectivity are unchanged, while the battery capacity has barely increased.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Xyb2LEjopek4Ege2FYrYW6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-rotating-bezel-close.jpg" alt="Looking closely at the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic's rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xyb2LEjopek4Ege2FYrYW6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung promised that its next Galaxy Watch will have an "innovative design" during its latest earnings call, so it's possible the Watch 8 will have a brand new look to go with the new software. Leaks are pointing to a squircle design on both the standard and Classic models to match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, which is nice to see after getting the same Galaxy Watch design over the last four generations.</p><p>Fortunately, if you're really excited about a Galaxy Watch 8 Classic bringing back the rotating bezel and retro Samsung style, the leaks suggest this is something we can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-classic-bluetooth-cert-spotted">probably look forward to</a>! However, aside from the facelift, Classic watches typically have the same hardware as the base model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ymJGfhDJUFbqMEyqRGWMUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-11" alt="One UI 7 Quick Settings panel on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ymJGfhDJUFbqMEyqRGWMUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Generally speaking, Samsung's One UI Watch is designed to mirror the phone software in looks and actions, like swiping to access the app drawer and quick settings. Where stock Wear OS is intentionally clean and simplified, Samsung's version sticks to what Android fans know.</p><p>I'm not sure how much of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>'s personality made its way into last year's Wear OS update. Stylistically, it didn't seem that different. And of course, nothing is official yet, and we'll have to wait and see what we get when Wear OS 6 and One  UI 8 are officially announced. Still, it's a relief to see Samsung cramming so many familiar phone tools into its watch to bring them into closer sync.</p>

<p>If you are a Dbrand consumer, chances are you are already familiar with the Robot skin that the company offers for its wide range of products. While it was earlier launched in 2019, the company is bringing back a new avatar.</p><p>It is dubbed Glowbot and is making a comeback for a limited time, and the best part of the new avatar is, it glows in the dark — thanks to the use of photoluminescent vinyl, the company notes in a press release. While it looks like a conventional Robot skin, it brings in a vibrant green hue in the dark.</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/the-ultimate-bluetooth-party-speaker-is-down-to-an-all-time-low-this-cyber-monday-but-you-need-to-act-now">StormBox Blast</a> continues to be a favorite, and the oversized speaker still does a great job filling a room with sound.</p><p>But I switched to the StormBox Blast 2 six months ago, and it may just be the best portable Bluetooth speaker around. The Blast 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-Bluetooth-StormBox-Subwoofer-Waterproof/dp/B0D9Y7N23T">costs $269 on Amazon</a> — $70 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tribit-StormBox-Blast-Portable-Speaker/dp/B09PMYTJD2">more than the original Blast</a> — and while that is a lot of cash, it's a good value when you consider just how loud it gets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rUcAn7APqYjABbqftGHmRb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rUcAn7APqYjABbqftGHmRb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Blast 2 has a cleaner design than its predecessor, and it is considerably bigger; it comes in at 19.18lb, and you can get a decent workout while getting this thing around. It's definitely the heaviest Bluetooth speaker I used, and while it is gargantuan, I like the changes to the design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XtsHUjpuxFn6wUP7DHpXPb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XtsHUjpuxFn6wUP7DHpXPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The RGB lighting at the sides is now a single bar instead of individual LEDs, and the overall design looks much more polished. After six months of use, I don't have any negatives to point out when it comes to the design or build quality. The back of the unit houses the AC port that's used to charge the internal battery, and it has USB-A and USB-C out, giving you the ability to charge your phone or accessories at 10W.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SW4ssT3GNhgoqVSFEjM7Jb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SW4ssT3GNhgoqVSFEjM7Jb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Tribit retained IP67 dust and water resistance, so you can use the StormBox Blast 2 at the pool without any issues. The ports at the back are housed behind a silicone protective cover, and you get a large carrying handle that makes it somewhat easy to lug this beast of a speaker around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3vXpDVnbytsYfEiX2v5nKb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vXpDVnbytsYfEiX2v5nKb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are three things I need in a portable Bluetooth speaker: built-in controls, good sound, and long-lasting battery. The StormBox Blast 2 ticks all those boxes; there are volume and music playback controls at the top, along with Bluetooth pairing, battery level indicator, and XBass mode. You can even pair two of these in stereo if you really want wall-shaking sound that's sure to annoy your neighbors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qXNWzUq7hk4dBGiTbqtRUb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qXNWzUq7hk4dBGiTbqtRUb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the sound, the StormBox Blast 2 gets <em>loud</em> — incredibly loud. You get an 80W subwoofer paired to dual 15W tweeters and two 45W mid-range drivers, leading to a total power of 200W when plugged in. While using battery power, it goes down to 180W, and that's still significantly higher than any other portable speaker I used.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TCVPTJxXSkQNB4YP8TJRRb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TCVPTJxXSkQNB4YP8TJRRb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to being loud, the sound is detailed; you get energetic bass with a big rumble, good mid-range, and clean treble. Vocals come across a little harsh, but on the whole, the sound is highly engaging. I used it in the living room, and didn't have to increase volume beyond 50%, and the massive size combined with the sound quality makes this the ideal party speaker.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2DtnYY9aCcCnyqz8pgKTSb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2DtnYY9aCcCnyqz8pgKTSb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the XBass mode does a great job boosting the low-end, and you can easily make out the difference when the mode is active. If you don't like the way the Blast 2 sounds out of the box, you can use Tribit's app to customize the sound profile; there's no 10-band EQ, but you can tweak the bass, mids, and treble according to your tastes, or select presets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="thzV9kNtUqZGWHXw6VW5Nb" name="Tribit StormBox Blast 2" alt="Tribit StormBox Blast 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/thzV9kNtUqZGWHXw6VW5Nb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery life is pretty great too; I only needed to charge it once a week on average, and while it doesn't quite last as long as the 30 hours that Tribit claims, I got 24 hours of use between charges. Bluetooth connectivity is rock-solid as well, and I didn't see any issues connecting the speaker to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the StormBox Blast 2 does everything I need in a portable Bluetooth speaker. It easily gets loud enough to fill a decent-sized room, and the sound quality is great — I didn't have any issues in this regard. Combine that with IP67 water resistance and 180W sound, and it isn't hard to see why this is such a good party speaker.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I like using TKL keyboards when I'm at my desk, but I get a decent amount of writing done on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/xiaomi-pad-7-is-a-convincing-ipad-air-clone-that-costs-half-as-much">Xiaomi Pad 7</a> these days, and on those devices, I prefer smaller keyboards. I have a half-dozen 60% keyboards that I switch between, and in the last two months, I used MonsGeek's Fun60 Ultra with either tablet.</p><p>MonsGeek is one of several dozen Chinese brands that make mechanical keyboards these days, and its products have a good design and decent value. What I like about the Fun60 Ultra is that it uses TMR switches that are easily configurable, and the small size means it is great to use anywhere. This 60% keyboard is a good value as well, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/MONSGEEK-Keyboard-Magnetic-Aluminum-Shine-Through/dp/B0DQWNJJ6X">coming in at $89 on Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.monsgeek.com/product/fun60-ultra/">$95 on the brand's site</a>. That gets you the multi-mode variant with Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity, and it's the one I'd recommend.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4ReYY3HUbHrDCVPXbrMjgQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ReYY3HUbHrDCVPXbrMjgQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Fun60 Ultra has a clean design, and it doesn't take up anywhere as much room as a full-sized keyboard. It has a 61-key configuration, and it pairs with Windows and macOS in addition to Android and iOS. The build quality is fantastic; it is one of the sturdiest sub-$100 keyboards I used, and the all-metal chassis gives it rugged durability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PEvPzEePUphAeA2Yuk9miQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PEvPzEePUphAeA2Yuk9miQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The aluminum construction is a clear differentiator, and what I also like is that MonsGeek went to the effort of providing shine-through legends on the keys. That's not the case with most keyboards I use — which only provide diffused lighting — and while it's a small thing, it makes a noticeable difference in daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UUxMf52Z7K3PWfRDHWufgQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UUxMf52Z7K3PWfRDHWufgQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The keys are made out of PBT plastic and are of a good quality, and they make the keyboard enjoyable to use. I tend to switch out the default keys and add my own (I like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-the-lord-of-the-rings-mt3-elven-keycap-set">LOTR Elvish set</a>), but I didn't feel the need to do so in this instance, and that's mostly down to the shine-through legends.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="29d8STTSSg3hgc4AzTALhQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/29d8STTSSg3hgc4AzTALhQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and did I mention that the RGB lighting gets bright? You get a good range of visual effects out of the box, and you can easily customize the lighting based on your preferences. The Akko Glare switch that's used on the keyboard has a see-through housing that does a great job diffusing light.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hYiRw8HNQVJXZApjVQpueQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hYiRw8HNQVJXZApjVQpueQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thanks to four rubber feet at the bottom, the keyboard stays planted on a desk, and while it is on the heavier side (it weighs 2.24lb), it is easily portable. After two months of rigorous use, I don't see any issues with the build quality whatsoever, and the Fun60 Ultra is clearly built to last.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2pXsM6DATSy6ogBUPfmyfQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2pXsM6DATSy6ogBUPfmyfQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a lot to like when it comes to connectivity as well; I used the keyboard predominantly via Bluetooth, but also tested it with USB-C to connect to my Windows machine. Bluetooth connectivity is solid, and it stayed paired to my iPad Pro M4 without any problems. The 4000mAh built-in battery lasts long, and I only had to charge the keyboard once a week.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C6tKF9xyMznqUHHvc3QogQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C6tKF9xyMznqUHHvc3QogQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, the keyboard has 8000Hz polling when used with USB-C, and this gives it a little extra versatility if you want a smaller-sized gaming keyboard that's portable. On that note, the keyboard has an Arm Cortex-M4 platform and TMR switches that unlock the Fun60 Ultra's defining characteristic: adjustable actuation point.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fDv7zrhghaRTdha9pRUEiQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fDv7zrhghaRTdha9pRUEiQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like hall effect switches, TMR switches use a magnetic design, and they deliver better accuracy and granular customization of the actuation point. The Akko Glare linear switch has a 3.4mm travel and minimum 25gf actuation with a max of 48gf, and you can set the actuation point to as low as 0.01mm, delivering instantaneous key presses.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ME7FFzsDkFRA8sHetPLLjQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ME7FFzsDkFRA8sHetPLLjQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This makes a sizeable difference, and having used several hall effect keyboards over the course of the last year, I'm glad to note that the Fun60 Ultra is among the best in the budget category. The switch doesn't have any wobble whatsoever, and the tray-mounted design makes it highly stable. In short, it has been a delight to use — both for gaming as well as day-to-day writing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P3ZuX7X7QoJFg388rToddQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P3ZuX7X7QoJFg388rToddQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another unique addition is the ability to add regular 5-pin switches; most hall effect boards only have the provision to slot in magnetic switches, but with the Fun60 Ultra, you can mix magnetic switches with regular mechanical ones, and that's great to see. You'll need to use MonsGeek's software to change the actuation point, and while it has its share of quirks, it gives you extensive customizability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vxHqmdNT4Ra7BHjFBkYJmQ" name="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra" alt="MonsGeek Fun60 Ultra keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vxHqmdNT4Ra7BHjFBkYJmQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, I didn't think I would use the Fun60 Ultra as much as I did; the rock-solid design combined with the TMR switch makes it a great budget keyboard, and the added customizability and vibrant RGB lighting allow it to stand out. The best part is the value; this is easily one of the best sub-$100 mechanical keyboards you can buy in 2025.</p>

My charging station has several Acefast USB-C cables, and I use these because they come with an integrated power meter, giving me a real-time indication of how fast connected devices are charging.</p>

<p>In the last six months, I relied on Rolling Square's inCharge XS as my go-to cable while on the go; the cable is just six inches long, and it has magnets at either end, allowing you to secure it to a lanyard, keyring, or your bag. It is on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Rolling-Square-inCharge-Universal-Eco-Friendly/dp/B0DQQ8SD9P">costlier side at $29</a>, but the cable has several unique features that justify the asking price.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="a5Dq9LzsvbJSuHbcvoZUen" name="rolling-square-incharge-xs-4" alt="Rolling Square inCharge XS keyring cable review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a5Dq9LzsvbJSuHbcvoZUen.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The inCharge XS is built to last; it uses a nylon-reinforced outer layer that's backed by a TPU cable guard, and there's a protective cap that secures both ends. It's clear that a lot of thought went into the design, and the cable is as portable as it is rugged. The cable is available in grey, beige, and orange, and having used all three colors, I prefer the orange variant — it just looks that much more vibrant.</p>

<p>The defining trait of the inCharge XS is the connectors; you get a USB-A and Lightning connector at either end, and the metal housing hides dual USB-C ports. Basically, you get a versatile set of ports that can be used to connect to any device; I used it as a USB-C to Lightning cable, USB-C to USB-C, USB-C to USB-A, and didn't see any problems whatsoever.</p>

<p>What I like is its charging potential; the inCharge XS goes up to 240W when using it in the USB-C to USB-C configuration, and it is the ideal cable to pair with UGREEN's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-25000mah-power-bank-review">Nexode 25000mAh Power Bank</a>. The metal housing has good build quality, and both ends are held together by magnets.</p>

<p>I didn't see any issues connecting my Seagate external SSD to my phone, and while the bandwidth is limited to to 480Mbit/s, it's usable. Basically, the inCharge XS does a great job as a daily-use cable; it attaches to a keyring securely, you get all the connectors you need, and there's fast charging and reliable data transfers.</p>

<ul><li>Pixel users on Reddit started reporting strange, inaccurate colors after taking photos.</li><li>One user with a Pixel 9 Pro states Google's photo processing alters the colors of their imagery far beyond what's expected.</li><li>There appears to be no permanent solution to fix this issue, as the user states turning options like Ultra HDR off doesn't help.</li><li>Google's recent May patch didn't touch on its Pixel camera; however, it did roll in a fix for a critical zero-day exploit.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Pixel owners have started voicing extreme displeasure with the company's seemingly overactive image processing software.</p><p>A thread on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1khba18/photo_processing_to_death/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Google Pixel subreddit</a> is full of users reporting odd, incorrect experiences with the phone and the processing software (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-image-processing-ruining-shots-3555627/">Android Authority</a>). The OP (original poster) called attention to the processing applied to photos taken on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. The user gives an example, using a photo of their Ford Mustang Shelby. The post shows two instances: Google's processing (left) and the correct image (right, what the viewfinder shows).</p><p>The car actually has quite a vibrant orange tone; however, Google's software seems to overdo its job, turning it into a much richer red. There are other aspects of the photo that are seemingly given a little too much saturation/richness, as opposed to what it looks like in reality.</p><p>The OP states they've experienced similar issues with the Pixel Tablet, too.</p>

According to their post, after attempting to snap a sunset photo, their device washed out the red hues of the sky, turning things more "yellow/orange." One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1khba18/comment/mr7cnx6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">other post calls out</a> the oversaturated/boost in contrast that Google's processing delivers, which isn't ideal for some users.</p><p>The user, like the OP, states there's no way to "turn everything off" to receive a photo void of Google's post-processing touch-ups. The original poster also states that disabling Ultra HDR and "rich color in photos" doesn't help. One thing that alleviates this issue is enabling "Top Shot." But the user adds that you must do this for every photo, as there's no why to keep this on permanently or disable Google's processing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is an issue users are struggling with, and this will likely continue until (if) Google offers a more stable solution. The OP adds they were able to get a mostly true-to-life photo from a Pixel, but they had to dip back to their old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-3-review">Pixel 3</a>.</p><p>Google's had a history of fixing and updating its Pixel camera, with its last fixes rolling in with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-april-security-update-screen-flicker-camera-fixes">April security patch</a>.

Another fix was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-march-2025-security-patch-rolls-out">entered in March</a>, but Google's processing wasn't mentioned in any of its patch notes.</p><p>As the publication notes, Google could rectify this issue by showing users outright what their photo will look like in the viewfinder, instead of surprising them after.

<hr>
<p>The CSA (Connectivity Standards Alliance) is releasing a small upgrade to v1.4 that should impact user setups in a big way.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/a-smarter-start-matter-1-4-1-makes-setup-easier/">its press release</a>, the CSA is detailing a "minor release" to its v1.4 upgrade that should refine and quicken the setup process for Matter-support devices. The CSA says these updates are "critical" to improving the setup experience users have when opening new smart home devices. This process sees Matter stepping up its support for QR codes by introducing "Multi-Device Setup QR Codes."</p><p>Many smart home users will know that some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter-supported</a> devices feature a QR code, so you can quickly scan and begin their setup process. However, the CSA states users are restricted to scanning codes one at a time and, at times, not knowing which QR code is the correct one.</p><p>Matter's Multi-Device QR code support makes it so users only need to scan one code "to set up multiple devices at once." This functionality will work so long as the devices in question feature "compatible commissioners."</p><p>Alternatively, Matter highlighted its new Onboarding Info in NFC tags. The CSA states this feature was designed to help users commission a device that's typically in an awkward spot once in place, like lightbulbs. With NFC, all users need to do is tap their device against the product. The device's onboarding information will be transferred to your phone to finalize its incorporation into your smart home.</p>
<h2 id="changes-that-matter-for-all-2">Changes that Matter for All</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wjB7hUWFYfXdLnpvAWTvwP" name="google-home-matter-light-update.jpg" alt="Using the Google Home app on a Google Pixel 8 Pro to turn on a smart light" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wjB7hUWFYfXdLnpvAWTvwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On a more technical level, the CSA is implementing an update to the core commissioning process via its Enhanced Setup Flow. The post states that this will support the "display of a manufacturer’s terms and conditions (T&Cs) directly in the commissioner app." Consumer consent for data will also be present. This change will affect device creators and the end user at home.</p><p>For creators, the CSA states they're now able to display their terms and conditions in apps beyond their own. For us at home, the change cuts one step out of the equation as we won't be tossed into multiple apps just for the sake of a device's terms and conditions.</p><p>The CSA's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-4-upgrade-more-device-support-roll-out">major Matter update</a>, v1.4, arrived in November with a focus on devices that'll help keep us warm in the bitter winter. The update included support for water heaters and heat pumps. Solar-powered products were also welcomed, alongside a few types of smart home batteries. The update also brought in support for thermostat scheduling and "preset modes."</p><p>With Matter 1.4, users could place their smart thermostat in "home/away and vacation" modes, depending on their situation. Matter's support includes thermostat triggering support for motion, calendar events, and more.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (May 8), Spotify detailed three new ways it's looking to improve the music discovery experience for its listeners in its app.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-05-07/experience-a-new-dimension-of-music-discovery-with-more-controls-and-enhanced-tools/">blog post</a>, Spotify highlighted the rollout of a few updates and a new test that users can expect. The platform says these updates are designed to place users "in the driver's seat" regarding their preferred listening and music discovery. Beginning with Premium subscribers, Spotify says the "Queue" is receiving an upgrade.</p><p>The post states your Queue is grabbing a visual refresh that places options like Shuffle, Smart Shuffle, Repeat, and Sleep Timer in easier-to-reach spots. Premium users are also said to see the tracks Spotify recommends in their Queue after the songs they've personally queued up are done.</p><p>Of course, Spotify's recommendations will appear if you've enabled Smart Shuffle or Autoplay. The platform says users can easily turn these off in their settings.</p><p>The test for Premium subscribers continues with an updated Hide button and a new Snooze button. The former will now hide a song on a playlist across <em>all </em>of your synced devices. The new Snooze button will give users a "temporary" break from a specific song, which lasts for 30 days.</p><p>All of these features are reportedly slowly arriving for Premium subscribers; however, there are plans to extend access to more people.</p>
<h2 id="playlist-customization-collabs-2">Playlist Customization & Collabs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1294px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="zujMii8FE4AEQpb79BMpan" name="spotify-mobile-app-playlists-menu-hero" alt="Multiple instances of the Spotify app on phones, showcasing its "Create" menu and playlists." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zujMii8FE4AEQpb79BMpan.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1294" height="728" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other side of these updates include better playlist customization options. These particularly concern mobile users, with Spotify preparing to rollout new "management tools." Mobile app users will soon find Add, Sort, and Edit buttons at the top of all of their playlists.</p><p>What's more, users who typically toss their tunes into their "Liked Songs" will find the ability to build a playlist out of its contents. Spotify says there will be an option to filter music by genre and a "turn into playlist" button. This feature in Liked Songs is rolling out for users in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the U.K., and the U.S.</p><p>Another Spotify app feature arriving is the Create Button, marked with a plus icon at the bottom-right of your phone. Spotify is placing features like playlist creation, collaborate with friends, and "join a Blend" within it. Premium users in "supported markets" go a step further by receiving access to Spotify's Jam and AI Playlists in the Create button.</p><p>Spotify's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-launches-personalized-ai-playlists">AI Playlists hit the app in testing last year</a>, giving users the ability to craft a playlist out of their words. The platform offers some pre-made suggestions to get users started if they don't know where to begin. Spotify encourages users to get creative with their ideas and see what the AI generator thinks up.

<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="df3573e5-4b08-468a-8e54-8240e7ac2b9b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get $50 off the next Galaxy device before it's even announced" data-dimension48="Get $50 off the next Galaxy device before it's even announced" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="B2FuqYxaZUEkHwVmgYdBUT" name="Samsung-Logo.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B2FuqYxaZUEkHwVmgYdBUT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="2048" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" data-dimension112="df3573e5-4b08-468a-8e54-8240e7ac2b9b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get $50 off the next Galaxy device before it's even announced" data-dimension48="Get $50 off the next Galaxy device before it's even announced"><strong>Get $50 off the next Galaxy device before it's even announced</strong></a></p>
<p>Sign up for Samsung's Galaxy Reserve program before May 12th and you'll receive a $50 credit to use towards (probably) the Galaxy S25 Edge when it's announced. Simply add your name and email address to the form and the discount is as good as yours. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="df3573e5-4b08-468a-8e54-8240e7ac2b9b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get $50 off the next Galaxy device before it's even announced" data-dimension48="Get $50 off the next Galaxy device before it's even announced">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Samsung has shared offers like this in the past, and believe me, it&apos;s pretty much the closest you can get to free money in this day and age. For what it&apos;s worth, I typically sign up every time new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> are announced, and I never have to deal with irritating marketing emails as a result. Samsung just hits me up once when the preorder period starts, and then I decide whether or not I want to move forward with my purchase. That&apos;s it. It&apos;s pretty nice. </p>

<p>The device in question is the fourth addition to Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a>, set to appear alongside the top-rated Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra that were released in January. If all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/massive-galaxy-s25-edge-leak-reveals-too-much">leaks and rumors</a> are correct, the Galaxy S25 Edge will boast a 6.7-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED display and use the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the rest of the flagship lineup. You can also expect loads of AI features and seven years of software updates guaranteed.</p><p>The Edge is expected to sport a smaller battery than its counterparts, presumably to make room for the ultra-thin design that gives the phone its name. The S25 Edge is set to weigh just 163 grams and clock in at 5.85 millimeters of thickness.</p><p>We&apos;re sure to see some other deals when the phone is officially announced — trade-in opportunities, free gift cards, and so on — but if you want to guarantee yourself some savings today, the Galaxy Reserve program is an easy way to snag some free cash with very little hassle. You can thank me later.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for an affordable foldable Android phone, you might have your eye on a Motorola model in the popular Razr line. There are a few generations to choose from, and two models you might be considering are the new Motorola Razr 2025 and the Motorola Razr 2023.</p><p>On the one hand, the Motorola Razr 2025 is the newer, better, latest device. On the other hand, you might find the older Motorola Razr 2023 for a steal. Perhaps you already own the latter and you’re wondering if it’s worth the upgrade. Read on to find out in this Razr 2025 vs. Razr 2023 comparison.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 is the entry-model in the latest line from the company, which also includes the higher-end Motorola Razr Ultra and Razr+. You’ll get a 6.9-inch AMOLED FHD+ 2,640 x 1,080 HDR10+ inner screen that boasts an ultra-bright 3,000 nits of peak brightness for comfortable viewing in any condition.</p><p>The external screen, meanwhile, is a 3.6-inch 1,056 x 1,066 pOLED screen with up to 90Hz refresh rate, HDR10, and a decent 1,700 nits peak brightness. Compared to the Motorola Razr 2023, the big difference here is in the size of the external screen. You can customize the external screen with various panels for the information that is most useful to you.</p><p>You can also adjust the phone in various positions, including Flex View, even holding it like a camcorder while recording videos. There’s also dual preview and the photo booth feature which make use of both the cameras and the foldable design.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 comes in new Pantone finishes, including Gibraltar Sea, Spring Bud, Lightest Sky, and Parfait Pink with leather-inspired, nylon-inspired, and, for the first time with a Motorola device in North America, lightweight Acetate finish. It’s equipped with a titanium-reinforced hinge that Motorola says is four times stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel. It also boasts ultra-thin glass, made of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus.</p><p>The phone has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">IP48 rating for dust and water resistance</a>, stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, and three microphones. It can be purchased with up to 256GB of storage. The phone will likely run all day, leveraging the 4,500mAh battery that supports 30W TurboPower charging to get an extra day after just a 15-minute charge. It also supports 15W wireless charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3999px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="fXTHrsCDX5KzynkbG2UGgT" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-14.jpg" alt="The Razr 2023 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fXTHrsCDX5KzynkbG2UGgT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3999" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparatively, the Motorola Razr 2023 comes with a vegan leather finish on the back complemented by a brushed metal finish that Android Central's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Derrek Lee says in his review</a> feels and looks “classy.” Available in Sage Green, Vanilla Cream, Summer Lilac, or Cherry Blossom finishes, the inner screen is the same 6.9-inch size, a pOLED with the same 2,640 x 1,080 resolution, up to 144Hz refresh rate, and HDR10+, but it’s less bright at just 1,400 nits, though Lee still calls it “punchy and bright.”</p><p>The biggest difference when it comes to appearance lies with the external display, which, in this phone, is just 1.5 inches in size. The tiny, rectangular OLED with 194 x 368 resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, and up to 1,000 nits brightness more resembles the screen of a smartwatch or a fitness tracker built into the outside of the phone. It’s effectively a small black bar that shows limited details. It’s a simple design meant mostly for glanceable information, but it might be appreciated by some to limit distractions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HhP7MdUAanqZRCEpx9bqha" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-13.jpg" alt="A clock face on the Razr 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HhP7MdUAanqZRCEpx9bqha.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lee notes that customization is limited to panels for things like weather, calendar, contracts, media, a timer, and an audio recorder. Swipe among them using a carousel, swipe down to access Quick Settings, or swipe up to see notifications.</p><p>While you can do simple things like delete an email from the external screen, for most interactions, you will need to open the phone. You can, it should be noted, take photos and preview the shot from the external screen as well. However, it’s challenging to take and orient them using the external screen, and you’re limited in the modes you use.</p><p>The phone has a sturdy hinge that Lee says leaves a minimal crease and feels even sturdier than the one on the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 model. The screen is covered in Gorilla Glass Victus for additional durability. It meets a higher IP52 rating for dust, but that’s less for water. So, this phone is more durable against larger objects but less able to withstand water sprays.</p><p>Oddly, it only comes with 128GB non-expandable storage, so you’ll need a cloud service if you plan to take tons of photos and videos, download apps, and more. You’ll likely run out of room fairly quickly if you’re a digital packrat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfBHpEDKGkAcMfetHV7WBY" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-8.jpg" alt="Notifications on the Razr 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfBHpEDKGkAcMfetHV7WBY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery-wise, you get a decent 4,200mAh battery with the Motorola Razr 2023, which Lee says doesn’t quite last a full day, but will get you through most of one before you need to recharge. It also supports 30W wired charging, but you’ll only be able to charge at a 5W snail’s pace with wireless chargers. It’s almost not even worth it unless you keep the phone atop a wireless charger on your desk all day.</p><p>This phone also has stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos and Spatial Sound along with three microphones. With both, you get the usuals like a fingerprint sensor, face unlock, Bluetooth 5.3, 5G connectivity, NFC, and more.</p><p>One important detail worth noting is that with both phones, Motorola promises three years of Android updates and four years of security updates. Since the Motorola Razr 2023 was introduced in North America back in October 2023, you already need to shave more than a year off that count.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 focuses heavily on an AI experience, as most of the latest phones do today. It comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> and, as mentioned, three years of software and four years of security updates. That’s behind others like Google and Samsung, which also make foldable phones. But it’s still pretty decent, getting you through to Android 18.</p><p>Running on an upgraded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400x</a> processor, which affords boosted AI performance, it’s the only phone in the new line that doesn’t run on a Snapdragon processor. However, Derrek Lee says in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">his initial hands-on of the Motorola Razr 2025</a> that he didn’t have any performance issues using previous generation Razr phones running on the older version of this processor, so he suspects the same will be the case with this phone.</p><p>You’ll get 8GB RAM and Google Gemini and Gemini Live alongside Moto AI.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, you can enjoy features like Catch Me Up, Pay Attention, and Remember Thus. There’s also Next Move on the external display, which will recognize what’s on the screen and offer suggestions for your, well, next move. This could be creating a music playlist for you while you cook dinner using a recipe you found online, or making a new wallpaper image inspired by an upcoming vacation.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a> with AI features allows you to give text or voice commands to share content from your phone to the TV, or even do things like pull up notes on a PC, great for multitasking.</p>

<p>How does the Motorola Razr 2023 compare? Since it was introduced a year and a half ago, it comes loaded with Android 13 and MyUX, which means you’ll only get up to Android 16 with this phone. That’s something to consider if you want a foldable you can hang onto for many years to come. The integration of MyUX adds some fun and useful customization features, though, like being able to twist the phone twice to activate the camera or chop twice to trigger the flashlight.</p><p>It runs on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 1</a> processor that Lee says gets the job done and comes with the same 8GB RAM. “The phone is able to handle much of my daily tasks without faltering,” says Derrek. He also found that it performed well for gaming, though it gets warm if you play intense games at the highest setting.</p><p>The big omission here is that you don’t get any AI experiences, beyond being able to access limited Google Gemini and Google Photos features. It’s overall a fairly basic phone that even has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-razr-plus-update-brings-moto-unplugged">Moto Unplugged</a> feature to help you disconnect when you need a digital detox break, effectively Motorola’s version of Focus Mode.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3725px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WpsdAUJDnMcVNvncKRwDfU" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-1.jpg" alt="The Razr 2023 on a pile of leaves" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WpsdAUJDnMcVNvncKRwDfU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3725" height="2095" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the cameras. The Motorola Razr 2025 has a 50MP main rear camera, a 13MP ultrawide camera with macro vision, and a 32MP front camera. You should theoretically get better photos with the AI-powered photo enhancement engine. We can’t speak to that until we’ve had more time with the phone. Stay tuned.</p><p>By comparison, the Motorola Razr 2023 has a larger sensor, a 64MP rear main camera, a 13MP ultra-wide camera with macro vision, and a 32MP front “selfie” camera.</p><p>Derrek says the phone takes decent photos, but they often leave him wanting more. It lacks in areas like contrast, white balance, color balance, or simple punch, but does take fairly good night shots. The results with photos are also inconsistent. Basically, the camera experience is not a selling point for this phone.</p><p>Enjoy all the usual features you’ll find in Motorola phones for capturing the best shots, like burst shot, auto smile, portrait, night vision, quick capture, and more. There are also features like gesture capture with the front camera and face beauty. But you’ll have to choose and store your photos wisely since there’s only a 128GB option.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-2025-vs-motorola-razr-2023-which-should-you-choose-2">Motorola Razr 2025 vs. Motorola Razr 2023: Which should you choose?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Denu4EfRCdzoo6borEdDZQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-2" alt="Three Razr 2025 phones stacked on top of each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Denu4EfRCdzoo6borEdDZQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It stands to reason that when considering the Motorola Razr 2025 vs. Motorola Razr 2023, the newer phone of the two is better. The Motorola Razr 2025 employs a better design, mostly better specs, and AI experiences that have become important nowadays for everything from convenience to assistance and even taking photos and videos.</p><p>With that said, it’s not a massive step-up from the Motorola Razr 2023, and still only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-vs-razr-2024">an iterative update from the Motorola Razr 2024</a>. So, if you invested a bunch in one of those older foldables already, it’s worth hanging onto for now, at least until the software support runs out. By then, Motorola will likely have an even better foldable to consider. If you really want to upgrade now, you’d be better off saving up to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, which is a bigger jump in features and will better justify the switch.</p><p>If you’re buying new and you find the Motorola Razr 2023 for cheap, amortize that cost over the number of years of use it has left when it comes to software and security support. It might sound like a good deal now, but it might not be in the long run. If you just want something for now, however, and plan to upgrade in two years anyway, go for it. Or, as noted, consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> instead, which ranks among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phones</a> as the best budget option you can buy right now.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4126px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kCvXeZAPLvcYnUPUW47z6U" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-15.jpg" alt="A notification on the Razr 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kCvXeZAPLvcYnUPUW47z6U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4126" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One important thing to note between the Motorola Razr 2025 and Razr 2023 is the difference in the external screen. The Motorola Razr 2023’s external screen is mostly for glancing at notifications, like a news strip across the bottom. “This cover screen,” Derrek explains, “is meant to give you the bare minimum while still serving its purpose of letting you decide whether or not it’s worth it to open your phone. It’s a shame Motorola couldn’t put a larger display on the outside.”</p><p>If you want something more robust with a much larger external screen, you’ll find value in the Motorola Razr 2025’s larger external screen. But you might also appreciate fewer distractions with the smaller screen of the Motorola Razr 2023. In this respect, it comes down to personal preference.</p>

With the... erm... messy launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>, it might be tempting to jump on board and give it a spin. Don't.</p><p>The idea of wrecking a phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> with unfinished buggy software is insane to me. I can see why it might sound tempting, but still, you're taking an expensive and finely tuned piece of machinery and installing software held together with rubber bands and wishes, hoping the useful bits are worth the inevitable problems that will arise.</p>

<p>No, I'm not talking trash about Samsung. Not at all. I think Samsung makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">finest phones money can buy</a>, and if one of the premium models fits into your budget you're going to be pleased with it. That goes for both the hardware and the software. It took a while to get here, but Samsung has shown how a company can use Android to make its products better than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">the "original" straight from Google</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-8-alleged-early-preview-report">One UI 8</a> will continue this trend. The company will change what needs to be changed in a way that seems meaningful, with the purpose of adding value to its products. A lot of people will agree and love it. But not until it's ready. We've seen time and time again what happens when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-launch-messy">release software that's not ready</a>; it's ugly and something you should never expect to happen on a very pricey phone.</p>

<p>When the One UI 8 beta <em>does</em> launch, people will be rushing to find a way to try it, and plenty of those folks will wish they hadn't. Don't take my word for it, just look at any internet community to see people getting more trouble than they bargained for with an experimental software build. The earliest builds aren't for you anyway, unless you're a developer looking to test how potential changes affect your product.</p><p>Samsung is going to show us something from One UI 8 that we really want to try, probably when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">announces the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7</a> or maybe even as a surprise at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O</a>. That doesn't mean it's ready for us just yet. Give it time to cook, and it will taste a lot better.</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps on iOS now lets you save locations directly from screenshots using Gemini.</li><li>A new "Screenshots" list can be seen in the 'You' tab on Google Maps, prompting users to review and save recognized locations.</li><li>The new feature eliminates the need to manually search for locations seen in screenshots on social media or the web.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Maps for iOS is getting quite an interesting feature that lets you save locations from screenshots.</p><p>Imagine you are that kind of person who often checks for new places either on the web or on social media — like a reel that shows some beautiful location. While you immediately screenshot it, Google Maps can now make a list of such screenshots in the app and help you save that location with the help of Gemini.</p>
<p>It is supposedly a new functionality, which is rolling out to Google Maps for iOS devices (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/07/google-maps-screenshots-iphone/">9to5Google</a>). Previously, users who saved the aforementioned screenshots would go into their phone's gallery to see the location and again open up the Maps location and check for the location to get an idea.</p><p>The new Maps feature, however, would save you from these steps and instead users would need to check for the 'You' tab in the Google Maps app wherein users will see a new Screenshots list with a badge indicating "Try it out."</p>

<h2 id="using-the-new-screenshots-feature-on-google-maps-2">Using the new Screenshots feature on Google Maps</h2>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/how-to-google-maps-screenshot-save-gemini/">shares a how-to post</a> explaining how to use the feature. Tapping "Try it out" will open up a video showcasing how the feature works, and users can simultaneously check the feature as well.</p><p>Firstly, users will have to allow Google Maps to access their photos, following which whenever a user takes a screenshot of the location info, they can directly head to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps">Google Maps</a> app wherein it recognizes a place and "a message will pop up telling you that it has places ready for you to review."</p><p>Users can then tap "review" if they want to save the image to their screenshots list or not, which is found on the "You" section of the Google Maps app. Consumers can also add older screenshots to the same list if they want to.</p>

<p>With the help of Gemini, users will be able to see the saved directly on their Google Maps or can look from the aforementioned list whenever required.</p><p>As 9to5 notes, the feature is currently rolling out to iOS devices, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android handsets</a> are likely to get it soon. Google previously highlighted this feature earlier this year in March, as part of its AI updates to get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-flights-traveling-trends-updates">users ready for the summer</a>. There were other updates mentioned, as well, like the ability for users to receive "trip ideas" for distinct regions and places in AI Overviews.</p>
