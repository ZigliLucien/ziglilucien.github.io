When cellular connectivity drops during a disaster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-outage-hurricane-helene-showcase-importance-of-satellite-connectivity">like it did on the Verizon network during Hurricane Helene in 2024</a>, it can impact people in need, first responder communications, and slow relief efforts. Roughly a year after the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene, I got a firsthand look at how Verizon responds to tragedies nationwide and keeps cell service active.</p><p>There's a team within <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a> that you might not have heard of called Verizon Frontline. Its purpose isn't to sell you cell phone plans or offer you a trade-in deal, but rather to develop and deploy assets that can help first responders in emergency situations. It's a collaborative effort between government agencies and the Frontline team to share technologies first responders didn't know they needed, and create assets first responders think would be helpful.</p><p>That includes emerging technologies you might not expect to be useful during a disaster, such as AI, robotic dogs, drones, and more.</p><h2 id="new-problems-for-disaster-relief-2">New problems for disaster relief </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qDzpfWvXjmmFVDnBRazEPZ" name="Verizon-Frontline-Truck-1" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qDzpfWvXjmmFVDnBRazEPZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Climate change is forcing emergency management departments and carrier teams like Verizon Frontline to adjust. Previously, there were narrower locations and seasons where you might expect disasters like hurricanes, wildfires, or tornadoes to strike. The situation is different now, with hurricanes striking in areas not prepared for them, and wildfire season in some areas of the U.S. becoming year-round.</p><p>This partly explains why Hurricane Helene was so devastating in states like North Carolina and Tennessee. In that instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/is-verizon-down-for-you-youre-not-alone">a major Verizon outage coincided with relief efforts</a> that appeared unrelated to the hurricane itself. These situations are where Verizon Frontline aims to fill the gap ‚Äî this team within the carrier has over 600 mobile assets scattered nationwide that can sprout temporary networks and connectivity in an emergency.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KZJtbeMUUYmRZrYsriqJ4U" name="Verizon-Frontline-Large-Trailer-1" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KZJtbeMUUYmRZrYsriqJ4U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One type of asset, called the Satellite Pico-cell on Trailer (SPOT), can be set up in roughly an hour and offers a few different ways of getting people online. The trailer supports multiple low-earth orbit satellite connectivity options, including Verizon's own satellites and Starlink. After the initial setup process, it can support up to 128 simultaneous users over Wi-Fi and also broadcasts cellular service over the Verizon network.</p><p>The small and versatile form factor of the SPOT allows it to be deployed almost anywhere and run for three days on its own power, thanks to a 30-gallon diesel fuel tank.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9eEk2KSUFXf6uYCrhByFzX" name="Verizon-Frontline-Small-Trailer-1" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9eEk2KSUFXf6uYCrhByFzX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All the Verizon Frontline equipment I saw firsthand prioritizes redundancy, whether it's a small asset like the Rapid Response Connectivity Unit (RRCU) pictured above or a full-fledged trailer. The RRCU, despite being much smaller than the SPOT and quicker to deploy, can still broadcast Wi-Fi and cell signals in areas where traditional towers are unreachable.</p><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-outage-hurricane-helene-showcase-importance-of-satellite-connectivity">we covered Hurricane Helene</a>, we emphasized the importance of satellite connectivity. It's unsurprising that Verizon Frontline is trusting LEO satellite connectivity to power many of its assets, but the implementation is clever. Aside from the larger trailers, the company is also putting satellite internet dishes and receivers on things you wouldn't expect, like off-road vehicles and robot dogs.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Currently, I'm keeping an iPhone Air in my left pocket and a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in my right pocket, and the latter has been my daily driver for months. Whatever your stance on thin-and-light smartphones is, a common criticism has been their pricing. It's hard to pay a premium when there are considerable compromises, but now you don't have to thanks to killer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays">Amazon Prime Big Deal Days</a> sales.</p><p>I paid for both my iPhone Air ($1,199) and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge ($1,099) in full, and I regret to inform you that the Galaxy S25 Edge is now at a painfully-low price. My loss is your gain: you can snag a 256GB Galaxy S25 Edge for only $684.99, down from a full retail price of $1,099. To put that in perspective, the discount is over $400 and 38% off, and it's literally lower than the MSRP of a base-model Galaxy S25.</p><p>In other words, if you've been cautiously intrigued by thin phones like the Galaxy S25 Edge, this is your chance to snag one at a major discount with no strings attached ‚Äî here's why you should.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>October Prime Day is LIVE - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="769257a5-8b01-405f-9169-6cd9fc4efe39" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVPJ5KD/r" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="4R8Syy78oyWM3AN6qWAwGf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-official-render-titanium-silver" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4R8Syy78oyWM3AN6qWAwGf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB:</strong>¬†<a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVPJ5KD/r" target="_blank" data-dimension112="769257a5-8b01-405f-9169-6cd9fc4efe39" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,099.99</del> <strong>$684.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review" target="_blank"><strong>Android Central rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</strong>‚≠ê</a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is the most versatile slim phone on the market today.

The bit of extra thinness, smaller form factor, and interesting camera plateau design makes the Air feel more exciting and different to me. However, I'm well aware that all of those reasons are also reasons why the average consumer probably shouldn't buy one.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> manages to get pretty thin at 5.8mm without feeling much different from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android smartphone</a>. It still has a premium AMOLED 6.7-inch display, the best Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, and a dual-camera system on the back. In my performance and benchmark testing, I've found that the Galaxy S25 Edge is not only faster than the iPhone Air, but also handles thermal throttling and overheating better.</p><p>With One UI 7 out of the box (and upgradeable to One UI 8), the Galaxy S25 Edge isn't lacking in the software department. I won't tell you whether One UI 8 is better than iOS 26 ‚Äî that's subjective, and Liquid Glass is controversial ‚Äî but it's my favorite Android skin from Samsung and comes with seven years of guaranteed software updates.</p><p>The cameras are another separator. I think both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> and Galaxy S25 Edge have great main cameras, but Samsung's thin phone crucially adds an ultrawide lens. Just before I picked up my iPhone Air, I used the ultrawide lens on the Galaxy S25 Edge to take a wide shot at a concert, and realized just how important that secondary camera can be. While there's no telephoto on either, both have 2x "optical-quality" zoom, so Samsung's offering actually has 0.6x, 1x, and 2x options ‚Äî superb for a slim device.</p><p>Overall, it's clear to me that the Galaxy S25 Edge is the more versatile device. At under $700 for a limited time during Prime Day, it's a no-brainer if you're even remotely excited by slim hardware. It's far less than I paid, and I'm quite happy with my purchase, so your deal will be even better.</p><h2 id="october-prime-day-quick-links-2">October Prime Day - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Audio accessories like Bluetooth speakers and headphones for your PlayStation 5 might be on the list. I'm here to tell you to save your money and spend some spare pocket change on something better.</p><p>Sony doesn't allow you to connect any first-party or third-party audio accessories to the PS5 via the console's Bluetooth. There's actually a good reason for that, but more on that later. The most crucial bit of information is this: you don't need to splurge hundreds of dollars just to get a dedicated Bluetooth speaker or pair of headphones that'll rely on an adapter or cable anyway!</p><p>Instead, you can get the UGREEN USB-C Bluetooth Adapter for PS5 and use any of your existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speakers</a>, headphones, or earbuds with your PlayStation 5. It doesn't even reduce the audio quality, because this super affordable dongle has the latest specifications that allow for high-quality audio playback. You can get it for even cheaper with this Prime Big Deal Days offer, saving you $8.40 so you can grab the dongle for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7CKV1J8/"><strong>$21.59 at Amazon</strong></a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="fdbcd0bb-b0b8-43cc-bd76-56de90722445" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="UGREEN USB-C Bluetooth Adapter for PS5 üì∫The UGREEN USB-C Bluetooth Adapter for PS5 is a simple bridge between your PlayStation 5 and all your Bluetooth speakers and headphones.

The answer can be found on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.ie/electronics/support/articles/00302454">Sony's own support forum</a>.</p><div><blockquote><p>Well, the reason the PS5 doesn‚Äôt support Bluetooth Audio connections is because of possible latency performance and bandwidth. Bluetooth is a wonderful technology with an ever-increasing potential, but it currently comes with important limitations when gaming.</p></blockquote></div><div><blockquote><p>As your wireless controller connects through Bluetooth to the PS5, it already takes up Bluetooth bandwidth, and adding wireless audio might lead to minute audio delays, impacting your gaming experience. The same applies to Bluetooth speakers. That‚Äôs why gaming headsets such as the Sony INZONE models use a USB dongle (or are wired).</p></blockquote></div><p>As frustrating as it may sound, wired headphones aren't always an option. Not everyone has a pair, and not everyone is looking to buy one just to use with their gaming console. I found myself in this conundrum, wishing to use the spectacular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/four-months-with-the-marshall-kilburn-iii">Marshall Kilburn III</a> with the PS5.</p><p>Sony recommends Bluetooth adapters, and I was looking for a quick solution. That's when I came upon this excellent dongle from UGREEN. The price is too good to pass on, even without the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days discount.</p><p>The UGREEN USB-C Bluetooth Adapter for PS5 is stupidly easy to set up and use. I was skeptic at first, I'm not going to lie, but the product worked just as smoothly as advertised. I highly recommend investing in one of these if you're in the same fix as I was.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Sony quotes up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, and I can also verify that I generally only have to charge the XM4 about once per week.</p><p>The sound quality delivered by the Sony XM4 is immersive and balanced too, as I have used these cans for everything from acoustic folk and death metal albums to staff meetings and Red Dead Redemption 2.¬†</p><p>Sure, there are newer models to consider ‚Äî and both the XM5 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">XM6</a> might be better wireless headphones overall ‚Äî but for me, the Sony WH-1000XM4 hit that sweet spot. If you can afford them, go with the newer generations of Sony headphones, but if you're looking to save some cash this Prime Day, this is easily my favorite headphones deal of them all.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-quick-links-2">Prime Big Deal Days - Quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Thankfully, three universally-loved BoboVR headstraps are on sale for Prime Day, with the classic style coming in at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJLG9SBR"><strong>an incredible $39.99</strong></a> out the door. This sale ends October 8, 2025, so be sure to jump on the deal ASAP before it's gone!</p><p>BoboVR's headstraps are stupid comfortable and all come with a brilliant hot-swappable, magnetically detachable, rechargeable battery pack that'll add about 2 hours to your headset's playtime. Since you can hot-swap these, it's easy to grab a few additional batteries and lengthen your sessions, or just drop a battery on if you somehow forgot to keep your headset charged.</p><p>All three of these amazing headstraps <strong>will work on a Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S</strong>. Here's how to choose between the three options this Prime Day:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><strong>Prime Day is BACK October 7th and 8th - see the full list of deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="48b8cedc-8551-4c18-aa13-b847dab8549a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="üîã - BoboVR charger + extra battery: $39.99" data-dimension48="üîã - BoboVR charger + extra battery: $39.99" data-dimension25="$39.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJLG9SBR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="eMFieoeEuwBoQyxT3tmpMm" name="bobovr-m3-pro-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eMFieoeEuwBoQyxT3tmpMm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The classic BoboVR headstrap design is also known as a "halo-style strap" and includes a plush forehead pad and angled, flexible plastic strap that wraps another plush cushion around your head. It's fully adjustable and can even be angled to fit any head shape or size, making it the best choice for most people.</p><p><strong>‚úÖRecommended if: y</strong>ou hate the pressure VR headsets can put on your face. This headstrap design removes all the weight from your face and evenly distributes it around your forehead and the base of your skull, instead.</p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if:</strong> you play a lot of active games or workout in VR. Since it doesn't pull the headset tightly onto your face, it can wobble a lot if you're flinging your head around constantly.

If you're looking for an option that has hot-swappable batteries, there's simply no better choice. Each battery pack is 5,000 or 10,000mAh in capacity, which will double or quadruple your Meta Quest 3 or 3S's playtime, respectively.</p><p>Those battery packs are all recharged via a simple USB-C port, so any old phone charger you have lying around will work. Each headstrap type comes with one battery, but you can always order extra to keep the fun going for longer. Check the blocks for each product above, as I linked the correct battery for each headstrap type.</p><p>Remember that while the batteries might be model-specific, all three of these straps work for either the Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S, so you can game in comfort even if you opted for the more economical Quest 3S model!</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This is because unlike the rest, the ROG Tessen can actually collapse and fold in half, making it great for throwing in your bag.

ASUS might've been able to push things a little further, but seeing as the Tessen connects to your phone using USB-C, it just wasn't possible.</p><p>With that USB-C port, it not only ensures ultra-low latency for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">mobile gaming</a>, but the ROG Tessen also allows for passthrough charging.

Sure, a color TV show or movie was an obvious upgrade from black & white from a fundamental perspective, but the quality of early color content simply didn't match the contrast of black & white programming.</p><p>Things were made worse by a lack of standards and difficult-to-use equipment. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOldPeople/comments/v04vgr/comment/iaee72x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">One Reddit user</a> remembers having to "twiddle knobs to decide whether the people would be orange or green."</p><p>In a way, color e-readers can suffer from similar problems but for very different reasons. I've been using the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II as my main e-reader since the middle of August, and I've been extremely impressed with the unit.

The design has been refined to feel more comfortable in the hand, and the OS features new capabilities enabled by the updated display.</p><p>But anyone coming from an older black-and-white e-reader will immediately notice the graininess of the new color display. Flat white backgrounds now have an almost "old film" quality, giving the picture a distinct character that isn't present on digital stock. The same feeling can't be said for reading, where this grain can be distracting for some.</p><p>Text on the black-and-white Boox Page looks smooth and clean. Even when viewed through a macro lens, the Page's letters appear to be printed ink. However, the color screen has a distinct digital pixel look to each character.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-letters" alt="Comparing the screen quality between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II with a few letters on screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5n3nCpRJ8XBpGkt3tPWE59" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-white-background" alt="Comparing the screen quality of a white background between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5n3nCpRJ8XBpGkt3tPWE59.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GjfUMuMPibK7oiWLr66U59" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-icons" alt="Comparing the screen quality between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GjfUMuMPibK7oiWLr66U59.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>For some people, this won't be a big deal.

That's made up for by the addition of color and a substantially better refresh rate, making it more versatile.</p><p>I also love the design changes, from the new button layout to the rough paper-like feeling on the back. At 7 inches, it remains a Goldilocks size for an e-reader since it's about the size of the average novel and is more comfortable to hold long-term than having to fold back a spine. Overall, a fantastic choice for an e-reader upgrade, so long as you don't mind the less paper-like display.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2fbefb4e-c054-44de-9deb-eaccc59c4ce9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P3dSym2GfCmLD7t3pS4XzS.jpg' alt="An official product render of an Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II with a colorful sketch on the screen"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Onyx Boox Color Go 7 Gen II</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>E Ink is already gorgeous, but when you add color to it, things get really impressive.

Your phone is optimized to do as much as it can while using as little power as possible, but it's still a very energy-hungry piece of electronics. We drain our battery so quickly because we use our phone excessively. If we use it less, we will have to charge it less.</p><p>Having said to horrible part out loud, there are things that can make a difference. For some of us, every tiny difference matters, so here's what you can do <em>without</em> putting your phone away.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kPyRVpvHn369kWqB9awZp3" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-adaptive-brightness" alt="Enabling Adaptive Brightness on a Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kPyRVpvHn369kWqB9awZp3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Dim your screen:</strong> Most of us probably use some sort of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-even-dimmer-brightness-tile-spotted">adaptive brightness setting</a>, which can help, but I know at least a few of us have that display cranked up all the way all the time. That's a good way to tank your battery (and your eyes). The best approach would be to set it to a manual setting and adjust it to be as dim as possible, while still being readable. Second best? Use the adaptive brightness feature that came with your phone.</p><p><strong>Choose a short screen time-out:</strong> Your phone's display shuts off after a set period of inactivity. You can set this time yourself in your display settings. The shorter the better, but I'd advise at least 30 seconds or less. It's easy to unlock your screen when you need to see it.</p><p><strong>Disable Always-On Display (AOD): </strong>While convenient for checking the time and notifications, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-will-finally-bring-always-display-its-phones-year">Always-On Display</a> constantly uses a small amount of power. Turning this off is a simple way to save a significant amount of battery over the course of a day.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ckMANBhLbAu8deVSnvKmb7" name="airplane-mode.jpg" alt="Airplane mode toggle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ckMANBhLbAu8deVSnvKmb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Only use the wireless radios you need:</strong> There is no reason to leave Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or GPS on if you know you won't need them. All these use battery, and you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-quick-settings-your-notification-drawer-android-pie">easily toggle them on and off</a>.</p><p><strong>Turn off a poor connection:</strong> If you're somewhere with Wi-Fi and your network connection is poor, shut it down. Activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-why-use-airplane-mode-during-flights" target="_blank">Airplane mode</a> or turn off mobile data, then manually enable Wi-Fi. The cellular radio uses more energy than most people realize, and a poor connection consumes significantly more of it.</p><p><strong>Check your location settings:</strong> Your phone will scan for nearby Wi-Fi and Bluetooth access points to assist in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whats-difference-between-precise-and-approximate-location-android-12">getting a more precise location</a>, and that can use some of your precious battery juice. Note that <strong>these scans occur even if Wi-Fi is turned off</strong>, unless your location settings are configured correctly. Yes, things aren't as accurate, but they're usually precise enough.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD" name="Google-services.jpg" alt="Google apps in a single folder on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Check your apps: </strong>We all want the apps we use to be ready instantly, and that means that many of them work in the background, at least some of the time. That's fine if it's an app you actually use, but what about all that garbage that came with your phone that you'll never open? Uninstall them if possible, disable them if not, and if you're forced to leave them running, remember this the next time you choose which brand of phone to buy.</p><p><strong>Uninstall any apps you installed and never use:</strong> The same reason above applies here. Apps that came with your phone can usually do a lot more than ones you installed yourself, but those can still drain your battery. If you don't want it, trash it.</p><p><strong>Use your phone's battery management features:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/youre-using-ai-all-the-time-and-might-not-even-know-it">Your phone utilizes AI</a> to "learn" which apps you use most frequently and which ones are most critical to its functionality. These apps are left to do mostly their own thing, but the rest of them are throttled down to use a lot less battery. It really does work. While you're in there, be sure to set your phone to enter battery-saving mode when the percentage drops below a certain point.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3299px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CHdefhY9i6jJTV9GQ2AGdX" name="UGREEN-Uno-2-in-1-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-15W-lifestyle-4.jpg" alt="UGREEN Uno 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger 15W" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHdefhY9i6jJTV9GQ2AGdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3299" height="1856" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate to say it, but these tips really won't make a huge difference. The best thing to do is find a phone that can do what you need it to do, as long as you need it to do so. Phones get better every year, and the battery life of a phone in 2025 is miles better than one from just a few years ago.</p><p>One last tip from me that many people overlook is the use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers">wireless chargers</a>. A wireless charger can charge your phone from zero to full, but it's best used another way: to maintain the charge. When my phone isn't in my hand or pocket, it's sitting on a wireless charger. Since making this adjustment, I can't remember a time when my phone died before I expected it‚Äînot counting the Pixel 4, because, well, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-phones-pick-new-features-start-june">if you had one, you know</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Add in a lack of promised updates and mid-level performance, and it definitely seems worth taking advantage of the discount instead of paying full price.</p><p>We've named the Edge the best Motorola phone for a handful of reasons, primarily because of its battery life, charging speeds, camera suite, and the vibrant 6.7-inch pOLED display. Like other Moto models, the Edge also includes a really nice anti-slip vegan leather backing, which feels good to hold and offers a little extra grip.</p><p>The Edge's performance is backed by a MediaTek Dimensity 7400 processor and 8GB of RAM, while the display also offers a 120Hz refresh rate. Although it comes with Android 15 pre-loaded, arguably one of the biggest downsides of this phone is that it only comes with two years of OS updates, which can be a dealbreaker for some.</p><p>For others, however, a $100 discount might be the right time to pick it up, as we would normally consider it a bit on the expensive side for the specs it has to offer.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-2025-quick-links-2">Prime Big Deal Days 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><u><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>USA</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>UK</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Canada</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>India</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong> </strong><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Target</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While a lot of the rage is about devices having OLED screens, you probably won't even notice that the Duet 11 is using a 2K LCD panel.</p><p>Powering the Duet 11 is the MediaTek Kompanio 838, which also makes this a powerful device that easily makes it last through the day. The Kompanio 838 is paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, providing <em>enough</em> power for most tasks.</p><p>Considering that there aren't very many ChromeOS-powered tablets out there, your options are already limited. However, Lenovo continues to prove that it's dedicated to providing an excellent experience, regardless of what the rest of the market looks like. That trend continues with the Chromebook Duet 11, and frankly, this is probably the best Chromebook deal for most people.</p><p>While Amazon has the cheapest deal on the Duet 11, both Best Buy and Lenovo have also discounted the Chromebook. The only difference being that those retailers are offering the 4GB/128GB model for $250, while this Prime Big Day Deals discount is for the 4GB/64GB version.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

So many of them look nearly identical and all claim to be the best, but there's only one <em>real</em> best in town: Xreal One, and they're at their lowest price of all time with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC/?th=1"><strong>this $130 off Prime Day deal</strong></a>! That makes them even cheaper than before tariffs jacked up the prices.</p><p>Xreal One has sat at the top of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> list since they debuted earlier this year, and it's for one big reason: they just work. That sounds really stupid for any tech product, but if you've ever used a pair of smart display glasses before, you'll know how frustrating many of them can be.</p><p>When you plug a pair of Xreal One glasses into a Steam Deck, smartphone, tablet, computer, PS5, or something else, you're immediately greeted with a giant virtual screen that stays in place like a proper monitor. That means you can comfortably move your head around and the monitor stays in place, just as if you mounted a physical monitor on an imaginary desk in front of you. No other pair does this, and it's why you should pick them over all the others!</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f0b21dad-251b-4ffd-9194-cb882256559c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$130 off now" data-dimension48="$130 off now" data-dimension25="$449" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC/?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="KFX2dSFxBQENgP39wxcKfJ" name="xreal-one-glasses-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KFX2dSFxBQENgP39wxcKfJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>There's no turning back once you try Xreal One. These smart display glasses put a giant virtual monitor in front of you with full spatial tracking so you can move around without getting motion sickness. Plus, with tons of comfort options and excellent hardware design, you'll be wondering why you didn't pick up a pair sooner (but will be glad because they're <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC/?th=1" data-dimension112="f0b21dad-251b-4ffd-9194-cb882256559c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$130 off now" data-dimension48="$130 off now" data-dimension25="$449"><strong>$130 off now</strong></a>)!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC/?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f0b21dad-251b-4ffd-9194-cb882256559c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$130 off now" data-dimension48="$130 off now" data-dimension25="$449">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>‚úÖRecommended if: </strong>you hate looking down at your laptop or portable gaming console and getting neck pain, you take long trips and need a "home away from home" desk, or you just need a way to focus on your work without distractions.</p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a pair of smart glasses with a camera or AI functions. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Ray-Ban-Glasses-Wayfarer-Frames/dp/B0CGXX2HG5/">Stick with Ray-Ban Meta</a> for that, instead.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><strong>Prime Day is BACK October 7th and 8th - see the full list of deals</strong></a></li></ul><p>Personally, I love using Xreal One while traveling for work or pleasure. When you're on a plane trying to get work done, it's nothing short of harrowing attempting to work on your laptop on those tiny seatback trays. Not only are they stupidly cramped and will surely give you neck pain from having to look down, but you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/HardFactorPat/status/1232784648222187523">get your laptop crushed</a> by a reclining seat!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JWjcCPRQU8f3m6WjHg76GX" name="steam-deck-xreal-one-pro" alt="A Steam Deck and Xreal One Pro glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JWjcCPRQU8f3m6WjHg76GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I use Xreal One with my laptop on a plane, I keep the laptop almost completely closed, leaving just enough room for my hands to type and use the touch pad. This not only keeps the laptop from damage, but using the glasses saves my neck since I can look <em>forward</em> instead of down. It also doubles as a privacy filter since no one around you can see what's on your smart glasses.</p><p>The same advantages hold true for when I'm gaming on my Steam Deck on a plane. No one can laugh at me while I constantly die in Elden Ring, and I can have a far more comfortable posture since I'm not holding my arms at a 90-degree vertical angle the entire flight. Plus, the eye-friendly DC-dimmed micro-OLED displays on Xreal One glasses give me the best picture possible, all without a headache. It's epic winning!</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The bright, metallic hue debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and Pro Max, instantly standing out from Apple‚Äôs typically conservative ‚ÄúPro‚Äù palette.</p><p>Unlike the subtle blues and grays of the past, Cosmic Orange feels loud but refined, a perfect middle ground between playful and premium. Apple switched to anodized aluminum for the new iPhone frames this year, which made richer and more vivid colors like this possible. And if early reactions are any indication, it‚Äôs a hit. Units in this new color reportedly sold out within hours.</p><p>The trend doesn‚Äôt stop with Apple fans. Dbrand has joined in, releasing its own Cosmic Orange skins that match Apple‚Äôs color. These skins are available for many devices, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> and Galaxy S25 Ultra, as well as laptops, tablets, handheld consoles, and controllers.</p><h2 id="classic-dbrand-humor-serious-quality-2">Classic Dbrand humor, serious quality</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.32%;"><img id="QAG2v9WQk34xGBAsAr4o3F" name="Pixel-10-dbrand-skin" alt="Pixel 10 with Cosmic Orange skin from brand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QAG2v9WQk34xGBAsAr4o3F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1105" height="556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In true Dbrand fashion, the company didn‚Äôt hold back on the trolling either. ‚ÄúWhen Tim Cook hand-picked the new Cosmic Orange colorway, he had no idea we'd be ripping it off for a colormatched skin,‚Äù the brand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/limited-edition/cosmic-orange" target="_blank">wrote on its site</a>. ‚ÄúTo be fair, we didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be popular enough to warrant a ripoff. Now that it has, we‚Äôre all too happy to turn your Android into a Temu iPhone.‚Äù</p><p>That mix of humor and confidence matches Dbrand‚Äôs usual style. But beyond the jokes, the company puts real effort into its products. The new skins are carefully color-matched and work with over 100 devices. Each one is laser-cut for a precise fit and starts at about $25, so you can add some orange to your tech without paying Apple prices.</p><p>If you already have an orange iPhone, this is a chance to coordinate your setup. Now you can match your laptop, console, or tablet with your phone for a seamless look.</p><p>No one knows if this orange trend will stick around after the next Apple event, but one thing is certain: the color‚Äôs appeal goes beyond branding. It‚Äôs about confidence, the kind that makes your phone, laptop, or controller feel a bit more personal.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fa3f1c77-8bea-4570-9cd5-49af4a3cdfba">            <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/limited-edition/cosmic-orange" data-model-name="dbrand Cosmic Orange skin" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7zmwoTWJ5hEGrMhXddDVo.jpg' alt="Cosmic Orange skin for Pixel 10"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">dbrand Cosmic Orange skin</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Apple‚Äôs bold Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro is already a hit, and now Android users can get in on the action too.

And don‚Äôt get me wrong, I test, play, and learn about all Android devices, but there has never been a good reason to fully convince me that I could switch from an iPhone to an Android and not feel like I‚Äôm experiencing an entirely different OS permanently.</p><p>This is coming from someone who‚Äôs used the OG OnePlus device, a Pixel 4, and the OG Motorola Razr.</p><p>I think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> was the phone that Google finally got right. Not only did it seamlessly allow you to switch from an iPhone to an Android, but it took out all the guesswork once you made the switch.</p><p>I‚Äôm not one to push people to buy things, but if there‚Äôs one phone you should buy during this Amazon Prime Big Deal Days sale event, it should be this phone.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVZVRZ"><strong>is currently 32% off, originally priced at $1,099; now it‚Äôs $749</strong></a>, which is a great deal, especially if you want to take advantage of some of the best features on this phone.

It‚Äôs a whole new operating system, and if you‚Äôve been used to one OS for years, it‚Äôll be hard to convince you to switch over.</p><p>I think Google made this process incredibly easy. It literally took me 30 minutes to switch over, and not only that, but have the same layout on my home screen as I did on my iPhone. Every single app was already downloaded and ready to go, and I no longer had issues dealing with different chargers ‚Äî <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">iPhone now uses USB-C</a>.</p><p>For those who have an iPhone 15, I think this was the phone that really allowed this switch-over to take place incredibly quickly.</p><p>But not only that, I‚Äôve said this before and I will say it again‚Ä¶the Google Pixel is the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù of the Android ecosystem. It is the phone that Google puts out as a ‚Äústandard‚Äù for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a> to build on and do better. It is the base phone that the Android OS uses to test out new Gemini features, which then go to other Android devices.</p><p>Now, whether or not other devices want to create their own version of features that Android OS or Gemini has is up to them. But in my opinion, I believe Google is giving OEMs a reason to develop better products, and they have done that with advancing the Pixel device.</p><p>I think one of the most critical aspects of the Pixel 9 series is that Google set a standard for AI features that a phone needs to have. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google got it right with Gemini</a>, and the company has had several years to enhance it.</p><p>Anyway, all I can say is that the Pixel 9 Pro is a gorgeous phone. It is easy to use, you won‚Äôt miss the iPhone, and you‚Äôre getting some of the best AI features ever.</p><h2 id="october-prime-day-quick-links-7">October Prime Day - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

As an Android tablet, it's pretty much the perfect tablet for almost everything.

The $249 deal is for the tablet itself, which works like most tablets you've probably used. It's got a gorgeous 11-inch screen that's more eye-friendly than any Samsung OLED tablet on the market, plus battery life that'll last you days at a time.</p><p>The Pixel Tablet turns into a brilliant smart home controller and a Nest Hub-like display when you dock it, showing off all your recent photos from Google Photos in an elegant way. It's the best digital picture frame you'll find anywhere, but there's a slight catch to this functionality these days: Google no longer sells its expensive Pixel Tablet Speaker Dock.</p><p>Thankfully, you can still get hub mode working just fine with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Multi-Angle-Portable-Tablet-reader/dp/B01IJ5A0PC/?th=1">$8 tablet stand</a> and one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Charger-Anker-AirPods-Included/dp/B0C8HHV9DK/">these $11 chargers</a>. That's a lot cheaper than the $129 speaker dock, even if it's not as elegant of a solution. You can see how that looks in the image below.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p6GUUYG9uRNTCMGC9Uq4DT" name="google-pixel-tablet-docked-with-charger-hub-mode" alt="A Google Pixel Tablet on a tablet stand running in Hub Mode while charging.

Additionally, it still comes with the beautiful AMOLED 3.4-inch cover screen and 6.7-inch main screen, which boast 120Hz and 60Hz refresh rates, respectively.</p><p>The Z Flip 7 FE also gets 8GB of RAM for decent multitasking abilities, as well as a 4,000mAh battery and an IP48 water and dust resistance rating. While users do complain about the 25W wired charging being a bit too slow for the price point, this doesn't seem to be a dealbreaker for most.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-2025-quick-links-7">Prime Big Deal Days 2025 - quick links </h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><u><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>USA</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>UK</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Canada</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>India</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong> </strong><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Target</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Previous inventions have included a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/new-gboard-keyboard-in-japan">one-meter-long single-row keyboard</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJY5d14qKs" target="_blank">bendable keyboard</a> that wraps around objects.</p><h2 id="completely-open-source-2">Completely open-source</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1185px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.76%;"><img id="aZFieaEzvH9ttfkW57deQk" name="Gboard-dial-version-schematics" alt="Gboard dial version being designed on a PC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZFieaEzvH9ttfkW57deQk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1185" height="637" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Japan / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Gboard Dial Version continues that experimental spirit but leans harder into open-source maker culture. Google isn‚Äôt selling it; instead, it released every bit of data ‚Äî circuit board designs, CAD files, firmware, and assembly instructions ‚Äî under the Apache 2.0 license on GitHub. That means anyone brave enough (and patient enough) can build their own rotary keyboard at home. For those less mechanically inclined, Google also provides plans for a simpler, single-dial version.</p><p>To picture how it works, think about dialing every letter you type. You put your finger in the right slot, turn to the character you want, and let go to select it. It‚Äôs definitely slow, but that‚Äôs intentional. The design encourages careful, hands-on input and helps prevent accidental key presses.</p><p>The design might even help reduce repetitive strain since it removes the constant finger-tapping motion of a traditional keyboard. It also features a charming mechanical feel, complete with the soft whirring sound of dials spinning back, offering a strangely satisfying, low-noise experience.</p><h2 id="more-fun-than-functional-2">More fun than functional</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1131px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="SCREumivmh4AMKb2KUWY34" name="Gboard-dial-version" alt="Gboard dial version with nine sets of dial" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SCREumivmh4AMKb2KUWY34.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1131" height="636" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Japan / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Japan clearly knows this thing isn‚Äôt practical for everyday work, but that‚Äôs not the goal. The Dial Version is equal parts joke, engineering challenge, and commentary on how we interact with digital input.</p><p>There‚Äôs even a nod to modern life ‚Äî a small accessory stand doubles as a video call control: place your mouse on it to toggle your webcam or mic, just like ‚Äúhanging up‚Äù an old telephone.</p><p>The company even experimented with a few design variants, from plain finishes to textured fabric covers that make it blend into home setups.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgdWyD0cBx4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> ]]></dc:content>

It seems the company is rolling out support for users in Arkansas. The publication states users can check to see if they have it by heading into Wallet > Add to Wallet > Driver's License/State ID.</p><p>For users in Arkansas, the process of adding your State ID to Google Wallet is just like all the others.</p><p>After selecting which state you're in, you'll be prompted to first snap a photo of the front and back of your ID. Then, you will have to record a quick selfie video of your face for verification purposes. You can send off everything required via the app, and you should soon receive confirmation that everything checks out, so long as all the steps were completed appropriately. This verification process shouldn't take more than a few minutes, and the alert will appear as any other on your device.</p><p>Accessing your digital State ID is a process similar to accessing your saved cards in Wallet.</p><p>Something that Google has warned in the past, same as the publication reiterates today, having your ID digital does not replace your physical version. This regards TSA and law enforcement more strictly, as they may still want to see your <em>actual </em>ID. Users should begin noticing Arkansas appear as an option in the Wallet app on their Android phones today.</p><h2 id="digitizing-cards-for-seamless-days-2">Digitizing cards for seamless days</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MVmCk9Ug8dRT4g9HQBSgYX" name="Google-Wallet-student-id-hero.jpg" alt="College IDs sitting next to an Android phone with the Google Wallet app logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MVmCk9Ug8dRT4g9HQBSgYX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's been working with U.S. States to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-digital-id-support-in-yet-another-us-state">incorporate digital IDs</a> into the lives of its users, and this work continued even through the end of 2024. Late last year, New Mexico joined an ever-growing list of states that support digital IDs in Google Wallet. It joined the likes of California, Arizona, Georgia, Colorado, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, and North Dakota.</p><p>The interesting thing about Google Wallet's current list of supported State IDs is that we were told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay/google-wallet-brings-digital-id-support-to-uk-and-other-us-states">about Montana back in April</a>, the same as Arkansas. Those two states were listed alongside Puerto Rico and West Virginia; however, we're only seeing Arkansas today (Oct 6). Montana has since joined. So, it looks like Google is still working through any issues that may have arisen before users can see those promised states and territories in the app.</p><p>That announcement in April also highlighted digital ID support in the U.K., too. It's a more secure/safe way for residents there to confirm their identity. While passports were a part of this expansion for U.K. residents, Google said it's partnering with Rail Delivery Group to bring digital ID support to "select" Railcards in the U.K.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Unlike the HTML5-based GameSnacks, these are native apps that run more smoothly and can even go full screen, though you‚Äôll still need to have them installed on your phone and, of course, be parked to play.</p><p>Some users may miss GameSnacks for its simplicity and fast loading, but this change signals a new direction for Android Auto.</p><p>With larger, more immersive games arriving on the platform, Google is working to make the in-car experience more modern and capable, even if it means letting go of the simple mini-games that helped pass the time while parked.</p> ]]></dc:content>

At this price point, it's hard to find many other competitors that even include ANC, let alone those from a brand-name like Samsung, whose products include a range of excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">phones</a>, tablets, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops">laptops</a>.</p><p>These make it particularly easy to pair with other Samsung devices, though they'll also work with just about any other Bluetooth-capable device. They also include touch buttons for playback and volume control, as well as simple recovery modes for finding the devices when they're lost. The included <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features also allow for live, real-time translation in some languages, while it's also easy to use the microphones for easy access to multiple voice assistant systems.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$97.99" data-dimension48="$97.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CF7GYNW2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1304px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:115.03%;"><img id="MBMe6LJJ6E5mArwjjVeoPU" name="samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-render-black.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBMe6LJJ6E5mArwjjVeoPU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1304" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Buds FE:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CF7GYNW2" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$97.99" data-dimension48="$97.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$97.99</del> <strong>$54.99 for Amazon Prime Day</strong></a></p><p>Samsung's FE Galaxy Buds are already amongst the company's more affordable earbud picks, but Amazon has recently brought the price down by 41% for Prime Day.

The so-called "Fan Edition" buds also come with built-in voice assistant access, real-time language translation features, and easy-to-use touch controls using the center platform on the earbuds. They also have SmartThings Find mode and Lost Mode for seeing their location on a map and sending a message to those who might find them, making them fairly easy to keep track of.</p><p>These earbuds are designed with a wing tip to help them stay in a user's ears more easily, and they also feature three silicone ear tip sizes in the package. While some users prefer a long, stalk earbud design or those that don't utilize an extra silicone ear tip, they look like a pretty decent pick for those who don't, and especially at this low price tag.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-2025-quick-links-12">Prime Big Deal Days 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><u><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><u><strong>USA</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><u><strong>UK</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><u><strong>Canada</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><u><strong>India</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><u><strong>Target</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While the OnePlus 13 is undoubtedly better, it isn't twice as good; the difference between the two is mostly down to the auxiliary cameras. Basically, the OnePlus 13R is the much better value, and if you need a new phone and don't care about the wide-angle and tele lenses, it is the device to get.</p><p>That's doubly so now; the OnePlus 13R usually costs $599, but it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/">now down to $499 on Amazon</a>, making it an even better value. To put that into context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8JXLJV">OnePlus 13 costs $849 now</a>, 41% more than the 13R.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="dc309387-5ecd-4141-ba54-1134a5de3d42" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="This deal allows the OnePlus 13R to solidify its position as one of the best value-focused phones of 2025.

It has a similar design as the OnePlus 13, and the 120Hz OLED panel is among the best in this category. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 may not be the latest, but you'll hardly notice the difference while gaming ‚Äî I didn't when I used the phone.</p><p>You also get a terrific 50MP camera at the back, and that's joined by a 50MP 2x lens. While it isn't as good as the OnePlus 13, it still does a decent job in most situations. In fact, the main camera is almost as good in all but low-light scenarios.</p><p>Then there's the battery; the 6,000mAh battery doesn't have silicon tech, but it is still the biggest battery in this segment, and it easily lasts a day and a half. In my use, I averaged two days between charges, and with 80W charging, it takes under an hour to fill up the massive battery.</p><p>All of this is my way of saying that if you want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/">new phone in the vicinity of $500</a>, there isn't anything better than the OnePlus 13R.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As such, the T7 not only includes tons of file space with the upgraded version offering 4TB of storage, but it's also fast enough for use cases like gaming, media editing, live recording and more. In particular, the T7 is well-liked for how incredibly small it is, easily letting users fit it into a pocket, backpack, purse, or other small bag. It measures just 72 grams and is just 8mm thick, making it a no-brainer as one of our favorite portable external storage devices.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>Prime Day is LIVE - see our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$187.99" data-dimension48="$187.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874XWW23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="guGxJXXZYZXnbMpqTwsnMh" name="samsung t7 portable ssd square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/guGxJXXZYZXnbMpqTwsnMh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung T7 Portable SSD (2TB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874XWW23" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$187.99" data-dimension48="$187.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$187.99</del> <strong>$109.99 for Amazon Prime Day</strong></a></p><p>With Amazon Prime Day officially in action, the retailer has launched a huge, 41% discount on this 2TB Samsung T7 solid-state drive.

While I like the cameras on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a> and the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a>, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> proved to be the best overall foldable in my usage. Unlike the last three years, Samsung delivered a ton of upgrades this time around, including an ultra-thin design that makes the Galaxy Z Fold 7 one of the sleekest foldables around.</p><p>The cameras are better thanks to a new 200MP module, the blue color variant is delightful, and the Z Fold 7 runs Android 16 out of the box.

Yes, I get that it's still a lot of cash, but we don't usually see a 20% discount on Samsung's latest phones, and that's what makes this deal that much more enticing.

I'm using the blue model, and it looks exquisite. Of course, the thinner design combined with a lighter chassis makes it significantly easier to hold and use. At just 4.2mm when unfolded, it is thinner than just about every other foldable, and even when you fold it, the 8.9mm thickness is in line with most regular phones.</p><p>Both the inner and outer AMOLED panels have magnificent colors and contrast levels, and the foldable gets a new 200MP camera that's astonishingly good. The 4,400mAh battery manages to last all day, and I didn't see any issues in this area.</p><p>Then there's the software; Samsung's One UI 8 is right up there as one of the best software skins on Android, and this is doubly true when talking about foldables. Samsung did all the right things with the software, and you get to maximize the real estate of the inner 8.0-inch panel.</p><p>Ultimately, savings on $400 is nothing to scoff at ‚Äî particularly on a new device like the Galaxy Z Fold 7. If you're ready to make the switch to a foldable, you'll should get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7JZYWLL">Galaxy Z Fold 7 while it's still available for $1,599</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Initially, I was impressed by the smartwatch's seemingly endless battery life that refused to drain weeks in. Now that the watch is a few years old, we've seen a decent price drop. In my eyes, this makes it an even more worthy buy in 2025.</p><p>Two years on, I still use the Amazfit Balance every other day. It covers all the basics and performs smoothly until today, and the battery has not degraded either. I get to track all my health and fitness metrics, there's onboard storage for music, and there are plenty of other useful features like the ability to respond to texts.</p><p>The Amazfit Balance launched in September 2023 at a neat $199.99 price tag. You can currently buy the Balance smartwatch for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M/"><strong>$149.99 at Amazon</strong></a> or other retailers. And with Amazon's October Prime Day on the horizon, you could probably score an even sweeter deal on this Amazfit wearable. Compared to the newer Amazfit Balance 2 that costs an insane $299.99, I still recommend the original Balance model if you're on a tight budget. This smartwatch was so well-rounded that I continue to recommend it as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/best-amazfit-smartwatches#section-best-starter-option">best starter option when looking at top Amazfit smartwatches</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8dbf869f-1aa5-417d-a27d-3675a72137af" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="It might be two years old, but this toddler is still going strong and definitely worth your attention.

If you're new to smartwatches and fitness wearables, this is an excellent entry point. The software isn't very complex, the initial setup is pretty straightforward, and you don't need to be very familiar with a wearable to figure out where everything is.</p><p>The has Alexa built-in, along with an onboard speaker and mic, so you can control your smart home and give Alexa commands or prompts. There's local storage if you want to store music on the watch and connect a pair of wireless headphones or earbuds with it. There's even NFC for contactless payments.</p><p>The 46mm case doesn't even feel like it's there, because the watch is so lightweight. The overall design is stunning, and the AMOLED display stays bright, crisp, and easily visible under the merciless sun.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3485px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3EeQpiajkQnqWGS3tyyuRV" name="Amazfit Balance" alt="Amazfit Balance smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3EeQpiajkQnqWGS3tyyuRV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3485" height="1960" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're going out for a run or working out, the Amazfit Balance is a comfortable fitness tracker that can keep track of your activities for you. Like any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/best-amazfit-smartwatches">great Amazfit watch</a>, the Amazfit Balance has hundreds of sports modes and can track a wide variety of activities beyond just walks and runs.</p><p>Since it has GPS, you can even record the location of your workouts. I like to log my walks and runs so I can view the route I took later. It's a great way to plan and track your activities. And with AI features like Zepp Flow and Zepp Coach, you can harness the power of AI to reach your fitness goals.</p><p>Amazfit introduced the full-sized QWERTY keyboard to reply to text messages on the Amazfit Balance. Back when I first tested the watch, it was a little janky. But now, this feature works much better than before.</p><p>This is a fantastic smartwatch overall, ideal for newbies in the wearable space who still want some extras but can't commit to Wear OS just yet.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, released in September 2025, are the same AI glasses everyone knows and loves, now with longer battery life, improved camera quality, and more styles to choose from.</p><p>But the newest kid on the block, Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses, does exactly what it says on the tin. Instead of being purely audio-only, like the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, the newer Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses feature a nifty display in the right lens that works much like a smartwatch. They're also more than twice the price of Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, so while they feel like the future on your face, there's a price to pay to get there.</p><p>So, do you need the most expensive pair of smart glasses Meta offers, or would it make more sense for you to save some money and opt for the tried-and-true AI glasses?

The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 is entirely reliant on voice interaction for nearly all of its functions, but it features a physical camera shutter button on the top of the right arm, as well as a touchpad on the right arm that can be used to adjust volume, play or pause music, and more.</p><p>Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses feature these same inputs in addition to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">a neural band</a> that's used to detect gestures made with your hands. The cloth band fits comfortably on the wrist you'll primarily use to interact with the glasses' menus and can understand your movements via electrical impulses in your wrist muscles.</p><p>This allows Meta to open up an entire operating system's worth of functionality for Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses, including the ability to perform tasks like zooming in with the glasses' camera without needing to touch your glasses or use your voice. You can even reply to messages by "writing" on a table with your hand, or perform fun actions like pinching and rotating your fingers to adjust volume or zoom in and out of the camera.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uNbz3i6S5ACdwfzna6hRvi" name="meta-connect-2025-show-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-app-ui" alt="A screen capture of Mark Zuckerberg showing off Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' app UI at Meta Connect 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNbz3i6S5ACdwfzna6hRvi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The UI on the Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses falls somewhere between a smartwatch and a smartphone, offering numerous ways to perform everyday tasks that are too cumbersome for a smaller smartwatch display. Since it's on your face, Meta says it allows you to be more present with people in the room, rather than looking down at your watch or phone to check notifications or messages.</p><p>The display in Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses enables visual use of Meta AI in a way that's not possible with the audio-only Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s. While both types of glasses can perform many similar functions ‚Äî such as taking photos or videos, providing live translation, playing music through the speakers, or using AI to identify objects in front of you ‚Äî the addition of a display enables far more interactive elements.</p><p>The display on the Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses features a convenient accessibility feature called Live Captions, which utilizes the camera and AI to identify the people you're talking to, then displays closed captions on the glasses' display. Since no one can see the display from the outside, these captions are entirely private to you and can be great for noisy environments or people who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p><p>Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses also have a visual viewfinder for the cameras, while Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 users will have to just click the button and hope the picture is lined up right. Ironically, though, Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 has a more capable camera that can record at up to 3K resolution or at 1080p/60FPS. That's an upgrade over the 1080p/30FPS camera in Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses.</p><h2 id="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-vs-ray-ban-meta-gen-2-which-should-you-buy-2">Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses vs. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2): Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-live-captions" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing live captions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Content creators will likely want to choose the smoother or higher-resolution video on the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s, as the first-person perspective and ultrawide angle are able to capture everything in front of you without an issue.

The big thing Nothing is highlighting in this update is the ability for users to activate call recording with the push of a button. Simply "long-press the Essential Key" to activate the feature.</p><p>It seems that during calls, users will receive a notification from their device stating, "Recording available." It will explain that users can long-press the Essential Key to begin, or they can tap the "start recording" button on the alert itself.</p><p>However, taking the simpler button-press step during a call will activate call recording without looking at your screen. After the call is over, your Nothing Phone will deliver another notification, stating the recording has been saved and that you can hop into your Essential Space to view it. Nothing's AI will generate a title based on the context of your conversation. It'll also state who was involved and display the recording for you to listen back.</p><p>Additionally, the AI will generate a transcript of the call with a brief paragraph summary and some main "highlights."</p><h2 id="making-the-essential-space-essential-2">Making the Essential Space...

For productivity, I recommend choosing an AI app based on the platform you use already. If you're deep in the Microsoft or Google productivity ecosystems, go with 365 Copilot or Drive, respectively. Those into Notion should use the AI features built right into the app. In terms of social media and photography, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ray-ban-meta-ai-versus-gemini-on-wear-os-pros-and-cons">Meta AI</a> and Google Photos are easy recommendations.</p><p>Either way, you can't go wrong with any of the AI apps on this list, and people really intrigued by the technology should try them all to find the one that works best for their needs.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV" name="lloyd-should-you-buy_720" caption="" alt="Lloyd going shopping!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">So many tech products! It can help if you take a breath, a step back, and think about what you <em>really</em> need. We're here to help you do just that!</p></div></div><p>Often, it's good to take a step back and see what you're going to get inside that pretty package. Was it worth what you paid for it? Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p>Amazon is once again having a big site-wide sale. Even if you're not going to be buying, you should have a look.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="the-pre-black-friday-advantage-2">The Pre-Black Friday Advantage</h2><p>Another Amazon sale rolls around, flashing limited-time deals across your screen, and you feel that familiar tug-of-war. Part of you wants to dive in, but the pragmatic voice reminds you that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a> are just around the corner, promising the deepest discounts of the year. If you've decided to hold your wallet tight for the biggest shopping weekend, you might assume you should simply ignore the current sale.</p><p>This, however, is a classic shopping mistake. Even if you have zero intention of hitting the "Buy Now" button today, actively browsing Amazon's latest discount event is one of the most effective ways to arm yourself with crucial pricing intelligence for the <em>real</em> holiday shopping spree. Think of the current sale not as a primary purchasing event, but as <em>essential market research</em>‚Äîa scouting mission that will save you time and money when the November frenzy hits.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-11" alt="A white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL on a latticework black chair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The primary benefit of browsing now is establishing a <strong>baseline price.</strong> Too often, shoppers dive into Black Friday with only a vague idea of what an item costs.</p><p>Retailers are masters of the psychological pricing game, and a big, bold "40% OFF!" sign can easily mask a modest actual discount, especially if the product's price was recently inflated to make the sale look better. You create a tangible point of reference by tracking an item's price during a major pre-holiday sale.</p><p>For example, if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">noise-cancelling headphones</a> you covet are on sale now for $199, you know that their "normal" price is likely around $250. When Black Friday arrives, if you see them listed at $185, you immediately know it‚Äôs a genuinely better deal. If the price is $205, you can confidently hold off, knowing that the "Black Friday Special" is actually a worse offer than the earlier sale.</p><p>This is data-driven shopping at its finest, turning you from a passive consumer into an informed deal analyst. Amazon makes its money from being data-driven. You can use the same idea to save yours.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NRTPFqbNzZDAGAwck8YTbm" name="Amazon-Echo-Show-5-03.jpg" alt="Amazon Echo Show 5 (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NRTPFqbNzZDAGAwck8YTbm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, Amazon‚Äôs mid-fall sales, like its Prime-centric events, often reveal <strong>category-specific pricing trends.</strong> Different product types‚Äîfrom Amazon's own devices to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a>, accessories, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">wearables</a> follow distinct discounting patterns. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/amazon-devices-and-services-event-2022-live-blog-everything-that-is-expected-to-be-launched">Amazon devices</a> (like Echos and Fire tablets) are almost guaranteed to see significant drops now, and those prices can often serve as a ceiling for their Black Friday price. By observing this, you can predict with reasonable accuracy which <em>categories</em> will see the deepest cuts next month, allowing you to prioritize your Black Friday shopping list</p><p>The current sale also provides an invaluable look at <strong>stock and seller behaviour.</strong> Are certain popular items already selling out? If a product is consistently unavailable or constantly fluctuating in price, it signals high demand. This is critical information for Black Friday, suggesting you'll need to move fast on that particular item or category, or risk it being gone entirely. Likewise, if you see an obscure third-party seller offering a surprisingly aggressive discount, it can be a harbinger of the competitive environment to come.</p><p>I'm old enough to remember the crazy, almost violent, consumer behavior over items like Beanie Babies or the Nintendo 3DS. We buy from home now, so things can sell out even faster.</p><p>Finally, browsing now is simply a fantastic way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls?ref_=ya_d_c_lists" target="_blank">organize your wish list</a><strong>. </strong>The impulse to shop during Black Friday can lead to poor decisions or a frantic, last-minute search. By clicking around now and adding potential purchases to your "Save for Later" list, you streamline your Black Friday experience. You can then quickly compare the November deals against your noted baseline prices without being distracted by the overwhelming chaos of the main shopping weekend.</p><p>In the world of holiday shopping, knowledge is power, and data is currency. Don't let the current Amazon sale pass by unexamined. Put in the legwork now, track those prices, and you‚Äôll find that the true value of the early sale isn't in what you buy today, but in the serious savings you‚Äôll unlock when Black Friday officially begins. Your bank account will thank you.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-quick-links-12">Prime Big Deal Days - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Specifically, the document the publication reported highlights the "LTE to 5G standalone transition" plans that T-Mobile has, which will reportedly occur over the next "two-plus years."</p><p>Regarding "business impact," the alleged T-Mobile plan claims its LTE contracts will not go beyond 2035, as the "LTE network will be maintained" until that year rolls around. It seems T-Mobile is expecting its LTE network to "degrade" as it puts its transition plan into action.</p><p>These issues T-Mobile anticipates include a bottleneck on its LTE network, as well as a hit to performance and service quality for phones, tablets, wearables, and more for LTE and 5G NSA (non-standalone) devices. This is also likely due to T-Mobile seemingly only looking to keep a sole 5MHz LTE channel available to the last remaining vestiges of LTE devices.</p><p>As T-Mobile moves into its 5G-only future, it states that by January 1, 2026, devices activated for its network should be 5GSA (standalone) capable, so there's no issue once its LTE spectrum is gone. Going by this report (and document), the publication assumes most of T-Mobile's transition to 5G-only will be done by 2028.</p><h2 id="a-change-in-service-2">A Change in Service</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="4ETTSfPhU6MfSiqtbJMkMb" name="tmobile5g.jpg" alt="T-Mobile coverage map" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ETTSfPhU6MfSiqtbJMkMb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="451" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the root of this report is that T-Mobile is looking to finally phase out LTE support, as the publication notes, this isn't likely to affect most consumers. Devices nowadays are already capable of that 5G future, so shifting LTE out shouldn't really cause a disturbance. We'll have to see where things go with T-Mobile, such as more confirmed information from the service.</p><p>In the name of "exciting" service updates, T-Mobile's T-Satellite network recently made an announcement regarding "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile/t-satellite-android-apps-to-the-stars-satellite-ready-access-on-t-mobile">Satellite-ready</a>" apps for your phone. The T-Satellite network enables users to remain in contact with the world even without a cell connection, as it uses satellites to do its work. Now, the company is extending that support to apps users frequently use, like WhatsApp, X (Formerly Twitter), AccuWeather, and more.</p><p>Users can still check in on social media and make posts on X without a standard cell signal. For WhatsApp, users can text, send pictures, and make regular calls and video calls all on its satellite network. Satellite-ready app access started rolling out to Android and iOS devices on T-Mobile's T-Satellite network on October 1.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Notably, live translation features that eliminate language barriers in real-time are on the rise.</p><p>We've seen features debut in smartphones, earbuds, and even smart glasses. Truthfully, the idea of live translation isn't new, but it's coming into its own in 2025 thanks to improvements in support and performance. Apple recently highlighted Live Translate as a perk of its new AirPods Pro 3, and a similar feature leveraging Google Translate already existed on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>.</p><p>So, is Google's or Apple's version of live translate the best? We tried them both, and although neither is perfect, these are the key ways they compare ‚Äî and which one we prefer.</p><h2 id="all-the-differences-between-apple-and-google-s-live-translate-features-2">All the differences between Apple and Google's live translate features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EhrBCszXotrftiBTQ5yUVR" name="Apple-Google-Live-Translate-1" alt="The Live Translate feature on Apple and Google hardware." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EhrBCszXotrftiBTQ5yUVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Live Translate is marketed as a unique earbud feature in 2025, but the legwork is still being done on your smartphone. To use Apple's live translation with a supported pair of AirPods, you'll need an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or newer running iOS 26 or later. While it might seem like an arbitrary cutoff, an iPhone 15 Pro is needed because live translation uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/this-is-the-best-thing-about-the-the-ever-evolving-wave-of-ai-on-our-phones">Apple Intelligence</a>, which isn't available on the base iPhone 15 or older models.</p><p>This also means that Android users who own a pair of AirPods for wireless audio (yes, they do exist) won't be able to take advantage of Apple's live translation features at all. By comparison, Google's equivalent is much more forgiving. You only need an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> running Android 6 or later to use live translation on a pair of Google Pixel Buds.</p><p>This includes all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Google Pixel phones</a>, but also the vast number of Android phones by other brands that meet the version requirement. You can use a pair of Google Pixel Buds with a Samsung or OnePlus phone and still use Google's live translation feature, for instance. You'll just need to ensure your phone has the latest version of the Google and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-is-about-to-tap-into-gemini-for-more-reliable-translations" target="_blank">Google Translate apps</a> installed, as both are required for live translation.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gZULkSsJYweAjdoMSeh8xM" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-2" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gZULkSsJYweAjdoMSeh8xM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the Apple and Google implementations of live translate use off-device processing by default, so you'll need an internet connection. However, you can download languages for offline translation via the Settings app on iOS and the Google Translate app on Android.</p><p>Apple also offers an "on-device mode" that will always use offline, on-device processing for translations. However, it's worth noting that this mode only applies to the Apple Translate app, which is used for AirPods translation. If iPhone users want to translate with Siri or Safari, those translations will always be processed in the cloud.</p><p>The way you trigger live translation on Pixel Buds and AirPods is also slightly different. For Google Pixel Buds, the preferred method of using Live Translate seems to be using Google Translate on your phone and tapping <strong>Conversation mode</strong>. Alternatively, you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> to trigger live translation by saying a phrase like "<em>Hey Google, help me speak [language]</em>."</p><p>There's no way to use Conversation mode hands-free without using Google Assistant; otherwise, you'll need to pull out the Translate app on your Android phone. Apple's implementation differs slightly. You can use Siri for translation, but the preferred method is to hold down both AirPod stems to trigger live translation.</p><h2 id="do-you-need-the-latest-airpods-or-pixel-buds-to-use-them-2">Do you need the latest AirPods or Pixel Buds to use them?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zGt85NjuYy6KGMHxvrRnWR" name="Apple-Google-Live-Translate-3" alt="The Live Translate feature on Apple and Google hardware." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGt85NjuYy6KGMHxvrRnWR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both Apple and Google have tremendous support for live translation features, even on older devices. However, Google clearly offers an edge. It has been shipping real-time translation on earbuds since 2017, dating back to the very first pair of Google Pixel Buds. The feature has since been available on every pair released since, from the high-end Pixel Buds Pro 2 to the affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-buds-series-review">Pixel Buds A-series</a> and new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-buds-2a-announced">Pixel Buds 2a</a>.</p><p>Apple's feature is currently listed as a beta offering, so it won't be perfect. It was announced alongside the AirPods Pro 3, but it's also coming to AirPods Pro 2 and the ANC model of AirPods 4 via a software update.</p><p>So, chances are, if you have a new enough pair of Apple or Google earbuds, you'll be able to utilize live translation.</p><h2 id="are-the-airpods-pro-3-or-google-pixel-buds-pro-2-better-for-live-translation-2">Are the AirPods Pro 3 or Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 better for live translation?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tTJNQPBUj2j9cUNUfCv9zR" name="Apple-Google-Live-Translate-2" alt="The Live Translate feature on Apple and Google hardware." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tTJNQPBUj2j9cUNUfCv9zR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The aforementioned differences between calling up live translation on AirPods and Google Pixel Buds are the most impactful to the experience. It's nice to be able to walk up to someone who doesn't speak your language, hold both stems, and start hearing a translated version of their speech in your ears. There are no voice commands or smartphone taps required when using a supported AirPods and iPhone, which is ideal.</p><p>By comparison, it can be cumbersome to use clunky voice commands or pull out your phone to use Conversation mode with live translation on a pair of Google Pixel Buds. Certainly not a dealbreaker, but it's a minor inconvenience.</p><p>In terms of quality, there's still a ways to go before we're conversing at a natural pace with others between languages. The live translation features on both Apple or Google earbuds have a noticeable delay ‚Äî currently necessary for processing and wireless transmission ‚Äî that might impede the flow of a conversation.</p><p>Additionally, it isn't uncommon to have either feature completely miss a sentence or phrase. All it takes is someone speaking too fast, a noisy environment, or an unfamiliar dialect to throw Apple Translate or Google Translate off its game. However, it's certainly easier to use AirPods or Pixel Buds for live translation than flipping through a language phrasebook or guide.</p><p>Like almost everything leveraging AI these days: when it works, it's magical, but you can't depend on it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra users give up a bit of room for a bigger battery in favor of a siloed S Pen, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable</a> users often sacrifice camera quality for the dual displays and hinge.</p><p>In 2025, smartphone brands are emphasizing thinness and lightness as key features. It started with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/i-bought-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-but-no-one-else-did">which drew ire from Android fans</a>, and Apple took that concept to the next level with the iPhone Air, which seems to concede <em>something</em> in every area in the pursuit of a futuristic design. It's the epitome of form over function.</p><p>As a result, the iPhone Air is inherently controversial. I admittedly love thin and light phones, and using the iPhone Air for two weeks cemented that as it's much easier to handle. That said, I also agree with the iPhone Air's detractors that Apple made significant compromises to get there, and it's an incredibly niche device for that reason.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimebigdealdays%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-my-7360981637827775870-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><em><strong>Amazon Prime Day returns October 7th - see the official list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-air-pricing-availability-and-specs"><span>Apple iPhone Air: Pricing, availability, and specs</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2btLdzoK4uUKxd9jBWuTB4" name="iPhone-Air-16" alt="The back of an iPhone Air in Sky Blue on a wooden bench." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2btLdzoK4uUKxd9jBWuTB4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone Air launched alongside the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup on Sept. 19, 2025, and is now widely available in the U.S and globally as of September 26.

It measures 5.64mm thick across much of the body, with a sloping camera plateau that stashes away the internals and a single rear camera.</p><p>The plateau appears much larger in photos than it actually feels in person. In fact, I've come to use it as a place to rest my pointer finger while holding the Air, sort of like a grip or PopSocket. It helps for stability and usability, as I can hold the iPhone Air one-handed without it slipping due to the plateau.</p><p>It's covered with glossy glass, but the main rear glass slab of the iPhone Air has a matte, frosted finish. I'm not sure I like the contrasting materials on the back, but the glossy plateau matches the polished titanium side rails. Between all the glass and titanium, the iPhone Air feels premium, possibly the <em>most</em> premium out of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/deciding-between-iphone-17-models-as-an-android-user-heres-what-to-consider">iPhone 17 lineup</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hewf9msP7VaZhRpjyRR2B4" name="iPhone-Air-8" alt="A close-up of the camera plateau of an iPhone Air in Sky Blue on a blue chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hewf9msP7VaZhRpjyRR2B4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The colors are relatively uninspiring. The Sky Blue Air used for this review looks very similar to the Cloud White or Light Gold models. I was so unimpressed that I returned mine for Space Black, which I think is the best color.</p><p>The titanium frame, Ceramic Shield 2 glass, and IP68 protection should enhance the iPhone Air's durability. I didn't baby my Air at all, rocking it caseless and dropping it accidentally on occasion, and there was no notable wear. The material choices here should help it fare better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, which has anodized aluminum that can scratch off or scuff up over time.</p><p>An underrated feature of the iPhone Air is its weight, as the phone weighs just 165g. It's slightly heavier than the Galaxy S25 Edge, but it's still incredibly light for a phone in this size class.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6Q8zCFn6AsbaT74uR5g9D4" name="iPhone-Air-13" alt="The USB-C port of iPhone Air in Sky Blue in the hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6Q8zCFn6AsbaT74uR5g9D4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the bottom, you'll find a slightly off-center USB-C port that's actually 3D printed to make it as thin and durable as possible ‚Äî a magnificent engineering achievement for Apple. You won't find any speakers, because unlike the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup, the iPhone Air <em>only</em> has an earpiece speaker.</p><p>This is understandably shocking, as we've taken stereo speakers on phones for granted in recent years. However, it's worth noting that the earpiece speaker is louder than expected, reaching a volume of around 70dB in my testing. Its volume is suitable for speaker calls, watching quick videos, or listening to a song. Quality is another matter entirely, because there's heavy distortion when the volume is set above 70%.</p><p>Even as a budding audiophile, I don't think the iPhone Air's mono speaker is a dealbreaker. It's fine in a pinch, and I can use earbuds, headphones, and proper speakers when I care about quality. If you're someone who uses their phone speaker, steer clear of the iPhone Air.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-air-display"><span>Apple iPhone Air: Display</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oN3nfs3HV8cD7B8zTU8kn3" name="iPhone-Air-4" alt="The display of an iPhone Air in Sky Blue on a blue chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oN3nfs3HV8cD7B8zTU8kn3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The 6.5-inch OLED display (120Hz) is gorgeous, but brightness throttling remains a pain point.</strong></li><li><strong>The Ceramic Shield 2 anti-reflective coating isn't as good as Samsung's, but improved scratch resistance is a win. </strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5-things-android-should-steal-from-apple-iphone-17-event"><strong>5 things Android should steal from Apple's iPhone 17 event</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/5-things-apple-stole-from-android-during-the-iphone-17-event"><strong>5 things Apple stole from Android during the iPhone 17 event</strong></a></p></div></div><p>The iPhone Air replaces the iPhone 16 Plus in the lineup, but only on paper.

is perhaps the best upgrade this year. It's an 18MP square sensor that lets you take vertical or horizontal shots without physically rotating your phone. Additionally, the Center Stage feature can automatically crop in or move out to ensure everyone is included in the selfie. I guarantee this is a feature that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5-things-android-should-steal-from-apple-iphone-17-event">Android phone makers are taking notice of</a>, because it's the real deal.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-air-competition"><span>Apple iPhone Air: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The iPhone Air's clear advantage over the Galaxy S25 Edge is Qi2 and MagSafe support. </strong></li><li><strong>The Galaxy S25 Edge is the well-rounded phone, with a better chip, extra camera, and more features.</strong></li></ul><p>The iPhone Air's main competition in the U.S. is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-camera-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, as they're both thin and light phones. The Air is thinner, but the Edge is lighter. The Air has MagSafe for easy midday charging, but the Edge has better performance and an ultrawide camera. In other words, both phones have major compromises; you'll just have to choose which ones you'd rather live with.</p><p>There's also the iPhone 17 ($799) and iPhone 17 Pro ($1,099), which provide a better feature set than the Air, albeit in different form factors.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-air-should-you-buy-it"><span>Apple iPhone Air: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CxdfbzBiceCduhEUm8Eez3" name="iPhone-Air-20" alt="Holding the iPhone Air in Sky Blue, showing the back of the device." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CxdfbzBiceCduhEUm8Eez3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want a large phone that's still easy to hold and maneuver</li><li>Thinness and lightness matter more to you than cameras or battery capacity</li><li>You don't need or use an ultrawide or telephoto lens often</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want the best-value hardware in an iPhone (get the iPhone 17 or a Pro instead)</li><li>You want a slightly thicker, but still thin, phone with fewer compromises (get the Galaxy S25 Edge)</li><li>You'd rather wait and see what improvements an iPhone Air 2 might be</li></ul><p>The iPhone Air is aimed at people who think having a thinner and lighter phone will make using it easier, such as runners who want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/foldable-phones-are-the-running-companion-i-didnt-know-i-needed">carry a phone with them while working out</a> without it being unwieldy.

Don't underestimate the compromises made to create the Air, either, because they're real, and they might change what you can do and how you can do it on your smartphone.</p><p>It's also true that the rumored foldable iPhone will almost certainly take cues from the Air's design. If either of those prospects excites you, perhaps you should skip the iPhone Air and wait. On the flip side, if you want a slightly thicker and more "normal" phone than the Air, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is a sleeper.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c16b02ed-53c1-417b-8889-d6d5cdaf1ac2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fmPbGHUfnJhg6TM3t6ypnW.jpg' alt="The iPhone Air in Cloud White against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Apple iPhone Air</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Thin and light</strong></em></p><p>The iPhone Air serves two main purposes: its 6.5-inch display strikes a balance between small and large phones, and its design is seriously thin and light.

For years, Samsung has been a crucial partner in building Google‚Äôs Tensor chips and modems, but that relationship is starting to look more like history.</p><p>The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-11">Pixel 11</a>, presumably powered by the Tensor G6, is shaping up to be the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Google flagship phone</a> that ditches Samsung modems entirely in favor of MediaTek.</p><p>The separation has been brewing for a while. Last year, the Tensor G5 used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10</a> series was already manufactured by TSMC instead of Samsung‚Äôs foundry, a signal that Google was considering reducing its reliance on the Korean giant. Now, with the Tensor G6, Google is apparently swapping out its Exynos-based modem.</p><p>According to Mystic Leaks on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/mysticleaks/144" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, the Tensor G6 (codenamed ‚ÄúMalibu‚Äù) is expected to come with MediaTek‚Äôs M90 modem. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-m90-advanced-cellular-modem-specs-detailed">M90 is no lightweight</a>: it promises 12 Gbps download speeds, dual-SIM dual-active 5G, AI-driven power optimizations, and satellite connectivity support.</p><h2 id="next-gen-performance-leap-2">Next-gen performance leap</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5035px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KXqaiSix2JfjJLxiU6WLx9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KXqaiSix2JfjJLxiU6WLx9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5035" height="2836" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These features put it on par with what Samsung‚Äôs modems have been offering. Given how much modems impact battery life and signal stability, this shift could give the Pixel 11 a real advantage in areas where past models have been criticized.</p><p>This isn‚Äôt Google‚Äôs first flirtation with MediaTek. Reports suggest the company considered the same modem for the Pixel 10 but ultimately stuck with Samsung‚Äôs Exynos 5400i. With the Pixel 11, however, the switch looks much more likely, as early testing has already revealed references to the M90 in internal builds and bootloader code.</p><p>As for the Tensor G6 itself, it‚Äôs rumored to take another leap forward in manufacturing. Google is reportedly aiming for TSMC‚Äôs 2nm process node, which would put it a step ahead of competitors still relying on 3nm. That upgrade could mean up to 15% faster CPU performance and 30% better power efficiency, according to early projections.</p><p>Under the hood, the chip is expected to use a configuration of one Cortex-X930 prime core, six Cortex-A730 performance cores, and a Cortex-A530 efficiency core, paired with an Imagination triple-core GPU. On top of that, support for LPDDR5X RAM, UFS 4.0 storage, and advanced imaging pipelines will help power Google‚Äôs signature camera features and AI-heavy software.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Switching to the SoundLink Plus, there's an immediate difference in the sound quality, and I like the sizing of the speaker ‚Äî it isn't as heavy or unwieldy as the Blast 2, but you still get room-filling sound.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4902px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="8McCEAUutF2DhNpiYQSmHh" name="Bose SoundLink Plus" alt="Bose SoundLink Plus testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8McCEAUutF2DhNpiYQSmHh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4902" height="2761" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The design of the SoundLink Plus is similar to its siblings, and while I got the black color model, Bose sells the speaker in blue and yellow if you need something that stands out visually.

The only other omission is the missing mic ‚Äî you can't take calls on this thing.</p><p>Other than that, I don't really have any issues with the SoundLink Plus.

If anything, most brands have pivoted to AI as being the cornerstone of their products, with Honor going all-in with its Alpha Plan. I'm still not convinced that AI-assisted features on phones are useful (at least to my requirements), and if you're of a similar mind, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-deactivate-ai-on-your-android-phone">deactivate AI entirely on your phone</a>.</p><p>But if you're willing to try out phone-based AI, there's no shortage of features available. Most brands have partnered with Google to pre-install Gemini on their devices, and they have their own suite of utilities as a differentiator. Samsung bundles its AI offerings into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, and given the scale of the brand's reach, its features get the most mainstream usage.</p><p>Chinese brands aren't shying away from integrating AI into their phones, and Honor is ahead of its rivals in this regard. Honor AI combines a suite of utilities, from AI-assisted translation and transcribing to image editing, and intent-based interactions. Having used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Magic V5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> extensively in the last two months, I decided to pit both manufacturers' AI offerings against each other, and see which one comes out ahead.</p><h2 id="galaxy-ai-vs-honor-ai-what-features-are-available-2">Galaxy AI vs. Honor AI: What features are available?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5122px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KQbQmTdNuzPugg2CJwNw55" name="Honor Magic V5" alt="Honor Magic V5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KQbQmTdNuzPugg2CJwNw55.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5122" height="2885" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has an extensive selection of AI tools, with 11 available: Call Assist, Writing Assist, Interpreter, Note Assist, Transcript Assist, Browsing Assist, Photo Assist, Drawing Assist, Audio Eraser, Now Brief, and Health Assist. What I like about Samsung's implementation is that most features can be toggled to use on-device models exclusively, ensuring your data doesn't go to a cloud server.</p><p>Honor has eight AI utilities not including the image editing features: Magic Sidebar, AI Deepfake Detection, Magic Text, Magic Portal, AI Subtitles, AI Translate, Call Translation, and AI Writing.</p><h2 id="galaxy-ai-vs-honor-ai-translation-and-contextual-services-2">Galaxy AI vs. Honor AI: Translation and contextual services</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9EvtFQDoc5yYq6nmjzcSWT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-17" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9EvtFQDoc5yYq6nmjzcSWT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The defining AI feature is Magic Portal, which the brand calls intent-based AI. Basically, it changes context according to the situation; if you've selected text, it pulls up a list of messaging apps where you can paste that text with ease. Similarly, pressing and holding an image surfaces Instagram, X, and other social media apps, making it easier to share content.</p><p>Honor says the goal is to simplify how you use your phone, and Magic Portal ties in with Google apps to provide contextual info. I use it predominantly to add a location to Google Maps to navigate, and to paste text between messaging clients. I use Magic Text quite a bit as well, with the utility able to extract text from images.</p><p>Honor's AI Writing and Samsung's Writing Assist fulfil similar roles, but I found Writing Assist to be better at summarizing long-form articles. You also get additional options when it comes to polishing text, and it has built-in chat translation as well. You miss out on summarization if you use on-device processing with Writing Assist, and Honor doesn't even have that option.</p><p>AI Subtitles is a nifty addition on Honor phones that generates subtitles in a real-time when a video is playing. It is is quite good at transcribing content on-the-fly and creating subtitles, and you can save the generated text. Accuracy is hit-and-miss based on the language you select, but I haven't had issues using these tools with English.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gozi9uemwzgkeZLP6qKEv3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-20" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Galaxy AI image generation hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gozi9uemwzgkeZLP6qKEv3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both Honor and Samsung have an AI-based interpreter, and they're just as effective. I talked in Hindi, and both utilities did a decent job translating in real-time to English. Both brands have a call-assist feature as well, and Samsung has the edge in this regard. When using Hindi to English, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 did a better job translating in real-time, and you can use it in several messaging services, including Meet and Telegram.</p><p>Samsung's Browsing Assist is definitely handy, as it lets you summarize web content with relative ease. Similarly, Now Brief suggests contextual content based on time of day, and it's more useful than I thought ‚Äî it's a decent alternative to Google's At A Glance widget.</p><p>When it comes to writing and real-time translation, Samsung just gives you more in the way of utilities, and I prefer using Galaxy AI to Honor AI in this regard.</p><h2 id="galaxy-ai-vs-honor-ai-image-editing-2">Galaxy AI vs. Honor AI: Image editing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XMStVceEZGKPC2EMxWris3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-22" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XMStVceEZGKPC2EMxWris3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both brands have generative image editing, and Samsung's Sketch to Image and Portrait Studio are plenty to fun to use. But when it comes to image editing, Honor's AI Eraser does a much better job than Generative Edit on Samsung phones. While editing photos I took in London, Honor's utility provided edits that looked more realistic, doing a great job taking out background elements and filling in the details.</p><p>Honor's AI Upscale and AI Cutout also do a standout job, but it's AI Outpainting that I like the most. The feature basically lets you expand the canvas considerably, and it is astoundingly good. I rely on this feature extensively, and it makes a genuine difference ‚Äî and it's effortless to use. Honor also has an image-to-video feature on select models that uses Google's Veo 2 image engine, and it's fantastic.</p><h2 id="galaxy-ai-vs-honor-ai-the-bottom-line-2">Galaxy AI vs. Honor AI: The bottom line</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5040px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="u372Yh3RowF9VsKcvsnsE4" name="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Honor Magic V5" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Honor Magic V5 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u372Yh3RowF9VsKcvsnsE4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5040" height="2839" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both Samsung and Honor have their strengths and weaknesses. If you need writing or real-time translation features, Galaxy AI has a definite edge over what Honor is offering. But if you rely on image editing and want to turn images to videos, Honor is unmatched in this area.</p><p>While Samsung doesn't offer quite as many features when it comes to image editing, it does a decent enough job in its own right. While AI isn't the differentiator when it comes to choosing between these two brands, the upgrades to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 make it a clear frontrunner against the Magic V5, so if you're looking to get a new phone this year and are considering foldables, the Z Fold 7 would be my recommendation.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fefb8cf5-0c48-42d6-8b75-cae91840c962">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hHR4D74gywDog26AHRpRkG.jpg' alt="An official product render of the blue Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is my favorite foldable; it has a thin design, fantastic cameras, decent battery, and one of the best AI-based utilities around. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

However, thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-labs-wants-you-to-test-the-future-of-ai-starting-with-music">YouTube Labs</a>, it's now the testbed for a new AI feature that brings AI hosts to the music listening experience.</p><p>It's not unlike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-ai-dj-curated-music">Spotify's AI DJ</a>, which features an AI-generated host that talks between songs to provide commentary or context for upcoming tracks. Except for YouTube Music, there are two AI hosts that converse with each other as part of a "radio show" called Beyond the Beat.</p><p>To some, this might sound annoying; after all, who would want some AI-generated voices interrupting their listening experience? However, I've found that I don't actually hate this new feature, and I hope it sticks around, with some changes.</p><h2 id="diving-into-my-favorite-songs-2">Diving into my favorite songs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vG9DF8AGbGzcVZmZ8sniwf" name="YouTube-Music-Lifestyle-01.jpg" alt="YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vG9DF8AGbGzcVZmZ8sniwf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond the Beat sneaks its way into your listening experience every few songs, with the two AI-generated hosts, Mo and Flow, chatting about the song that just played and/or the upcoming song. The first time you enable the feature, they'll even introduce themselves after the first listen to let you know that they are, in fact, AI, and that they can get some things wrong.</p><p>However, despite being AI, they actually have surprisingly great chemistry and ooze personality. The conversations flow pretty seamlessly between these two, and if you didn't know they were AI, you might think they were actual radio hosts.</p><p>Like Spotify's AI DJ, they'll only interject every so often, and when they do, it'll last for less than a minute, usually around 40 seconds. Usually, the conversations provide context to a song, such as backstory or trivia, and I actually find much of the commentary pretty fascinating.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6" name="youtube-music-hero.jpg" alt="youtube music hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first time "Beyond the Beat" came on, the hosts discussed how the song "Yours" by Mariah Carey was initially intended as a duet with Justin Timberlake, but contractual complications resulted in only a solo version being released. That's something I had heard before, but it was surprising to hear it from the hosts.</p><p>At one point, they discussed Doja Cat's "Jealous Type" being performed at the VMAs and how it was Kenny G's first time performing at the awards show. It reminded me of how shocked I was to see him opening for her performance, so this was a great context to add to what I thought was a fantastic moment.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/539VLXMEoKg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>They also pointed out how Kelly Rowland's "Commander" has some deliberate grammatical errors, and provided the history behind the name of the track "Lionheart (Fearless)" by Joel Corry and Tom Grennan. I was also surprised to learn how people apparently thought that "Rocketeers" by Far East Movement was copying a track from Justin Bieber (despite it being produced first).</p><p>I also got a chuckle when the hosts were discussing how Craig David's "Ain't Giving Up" was instrumental in his big comeback, and at one point, Flow commented how she remembers him "from way back."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Y9MMffDRv2UBKhoALXSKgH" name="YouTube-Music-1" alt=""Ain't Giving Up" on YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y9MMffDRv2UBKhoALXSKgH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, many of these facts are things you could learn with a quick Google Search, but I'm often not that curious enough about what I'm listening to, at least enough that would warrant a search. That's probably a big reason why I appreciate the short interruptions, as I feel like it adds, not detracts, from my listening experience.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-for-everyone-2">It's not for everyone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4141px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7X3A6kvqLQFqcU7ByhXv5U" name="Spotify-and-YouTube-Music-1" alt="Two phones next to each other with Spotify and YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7X3A6kvqLQFqcU7ByhXv5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4141" height="2329" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, I understand this isn't for everyone. If you're listening to music, sometimes you just want to get lost in the tunes without being interrupted by AI-generated music trivia.</p><p>Even a quick search on Reddit will reveal people complaining about the feature, with some questioning why anyone would want such a feature, and others expressing frustration about the inability to permanently mute it. One compares it to Spotify's AI DJ and notes that it doesn't significantly enhance the listening experience on the popular streaming app.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1nuqdh2/comment/nh31aq6">Comment</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology">r/technology</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Fortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/switching-from-youtube-music-to-spotify">YouTube Music knows my tastes pretty well</a>, and the hosts are only available when you start a radio station or an auto-generated mix, so the vibe of the songs melds pretty well in my experience.</p><p>It should be noted that while you can't permanently mute the hosts, you can snooze the feature for one hour or a day. That said, it's only a test at this stage, so it's not yet widely available. US-based subscribers will have to consciously sign up for and enable the experiment for it to appear. As a result, most users won't have to worry about an annoying AI-generated radio show ruining their music experience.</p><p>With any luck, any kinks will be ironed out before a potential wide release, and the AI hosts will be an opt-in feature rather than an opt-out. It would also be great to see how Google can expand on it, similar to how Spotify has expanded the feature to support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-dj-voice-song-requests-premium-details">voice requests for songs</a> (as opposed to just choosing a song for you).</p><h2 id="how-to-get-started-2">How to get started</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3854px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="zPYDgWPFdrfoTVc3XWu6UJ" name="YouTube-Labs" alt="YouTube Labs page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zPYDgWPFdrfoTVc3XWu6UJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3854" height="2167" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you wanna give this a try, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-youtube-music-ai-hosts">enabling YouTube Music's AI hosts</a> is pretty simple.

As someone who's trying to raise her child without screen time until he goes to school, I totally forgot about the home speakers we're always talking to and the role they play in our lives.</p><h2 id="google-assistant-doubles-as-a-digital-nanny-2">Google Assistant doubles as a digital nanny</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nnGfTipg5vAPY2CBVHGCEL" name="Baby-watching-the-screen" alt="Baby watching the blank screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nnGfTipg5vAPY2CBVHGCEL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At first, it didn't bother me as much, but I did<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thebump.com/news/baby-first-word-google-tweet"> some digging</a> and found out that I wasn't the only one seeking Google's help. Whether it was to soothe a fussy baby, distract him from something he couldn't have, or even for an impromptu dance party during lunchtime, Google Assistant had been this invisible presence, getting us through those moments when our hands were literally full.</p><p>Both my Sony Bravia OLED TV and Bose soundbar are Google-integrated. Just last week, when our TV remote went missing, we were left to navigate the TV purely by voice commands. So for a week, my life basically revolved around saying things like, "Hey Google, can you play 'Burning Ghat' by Rishab Sharma on YouTube" when my toddler wouldn't stop crying, asking about the weather before a walk, or even adjusting the TV volume to "15%" while juggling a million other things.</p><p>So, when he watches me talk to thin air, anytime I say "Hey Google," he looks at the TV, as if it's going to answer back (which it does), and is captivated by this invisible person who magically controls things around the house.</p><h2 id="parenting-in-the-age-of-ai-powered-digital-assistants-2">Parenting in the age of AI powered Digital assistants </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1305px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aNm6rwnACEjtCPxC5urSce" name="amazon-2025-echo-series-ai-alexa-hero" alt="The 2025 Amazon Echo series launch, featuring the new Dot Max and the latest Show 8 and Show 11." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aNm6rwnACEjtCPxC5urSce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1305" height="734" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To put things in perspective, many parents unknowingly reach for a digital assistant like Google, Siri, or Alexa due to the sheer convenience of using a simple voice command to summon it.

While this study was conducted six years ago, the number will likely be much higher today, considering every other appliance in the house is trying to "outsmart" one another, from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-speaker">smart speakers</a> to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/you-can-play-retro-games-on-practically-anything"> voice-enabled TVs</a>, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eufy.com/ca/products/t2351111?variant=43005811294373">vacuum cleaners</a>.</p><p>While these AI-enabled devices actually help save me from a possible meltdown,  I sometimes worry they might intrude on those private bonding moments with my baby, especially when he learns to summon Google himself.

However, that's taken a step further with some companies trying to tap actors like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-trying-to-steal-scarlett-johanssons-voice-to-make-ai-feel-comfortable-is-the-reason-why-its-so-worrying">Scarlett Johansson to use their voice for</a> AI assistants (remember, she was the voice of the AI in the film "Her").</p><p>Google assigned a team to develop a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://synpost.synup.com/history-and-future-of-voice-search-google/#:~:text=And%20what%20was%20more%2C%20the,haven't%20watch%20this%20before.">"little more of a personality"</a> for the Assistant, ensuring the voice sounds friendly, approachable, and trustworthy ‚Äîqualities that are also inherent in human beings. This leads me to my point of how my now one-year-old might perceive this voice in the cloud, talking back to him. Does he see it as a family member, or just a large, rectangular bar that has come to life?</p><p>So, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-sued-for-allegedly-contributing-to-teen-suicide">we need to teach our kids early on</a> how to distinguish between genuine conversations and superficial chats. Much like Android Central Senior Editor Nick Sutrich's son, who uses a Google Nest speaker for funny questions and setting timers (which is mostly what the family uses it for, too).</p><p>Sutrich tells me, "I do remember we ingrained in him (when they first got the speaker) that Google isn't smart and it's not a person. Whatever answers it gives you are not the truth and may often be quite wrong, so it's fine to ask it a question, but always check with a person before trusting it."</p><h2 id="the-way-forward-2">The way forward</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZF4DmAcpPR9hF76uZEPQak" name="amazon-echo-4th-gen-lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="Amazon Echo 4th Gen Lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZF4DmAcpPR9hF76uZEPQak.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, I'm only going to lose if I try to raise my child in an AI-free home, since Google and Amazon have both now launched new AI-powered speakers that already recognize different household voices, understand content, and sync with other devices. And as IDC's Research Manager,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/exclusive-how-google-and-amazon-are-making-your-smart-home-truly-intelligent"> Jitesh Ubrani notes</a>, these devices are not just assistants anymore; they're actively shaping a new, smarter home.</p><p>For parents, this means the real challenge isn't completely shutting out AI, but rather raising kids who are tech-savvy, yet also understand when to reach out for a human connection rather than relying on a machine for answers to life's questions. So maybe my son's "Hey, Google" isn't a bad thing after all. It is a constant reminder that technology is advancing rapidly, and it's up to us to ensure our kids can keep pace with it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Alternatively, you can simply ask Meta AI, "What are my upcoming reminders?" If you enable location tracking, you'll be able to see exactly where you created a reminder, which may help you locate what you're looking for.</p><p>You can also <strong>set timers</strong> using Meta AI, which will appear in the Meta AI app. You can ask the AI for your time remaining and edit it if necessary.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J6y4FYWdWduw9eBsz4YzMJ" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-charging-app-01" alt="Looking at the battery life for Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses in the Meta AI app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J6y4FYWdWduw9eBsz4YzMJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the Devices tab of the Meta AI app, tap the <strong>cog icon</strong> next to your glasses, then the <strong>Meta AI settings</strong>. Under <strong>Language and voice</strong>, you'll find low, medium, or high-pitched voice options, as well as AI voices for Awkwafina, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, and Kristen Bell. You may find these cool or uncanny; I find it more useful to switch the <strong>Speaking rate</strong> to 1.25X so that I'm not waiting as long to get a response to my questions.</p><p>By default, your glasses are always listening for a "Hey Meta" command. If you want to conserve battery life, you can go into your <strong>device settings > Meta AI > "Hey Meta" preferences</strong> to turn this feature off. You can then summon Meta AI by tapping and holding the touchpad instead.</p><p>If you leave "Hey Meta" on, double-check that <strong>Respond without "Hey Meta" </strong>is toggled as well. You'll still have to say the wake word once, but after Meta AI answers, it'll listen for a reply for about five seconds. So if you asked about the Lincoln Memorial in front of you, you could follow up with "When did he die?" and have Meta understand who "he" is from context.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-live-ai"><span>Live AI</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FUQBYtcKssnyUTHYUer6MQ" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-smart-glasses-skyler-photo-1" alt="A photo of a model wearing Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses in the Skyler Shiny Chalky Gray style" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FUQBYtcKssnyUTHYUer6MQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Say "Hey Meta, start Live AI," and the assistant will activate your mic and camera continuously until you end the session; you can then ask as many questions as you'd like without the "Hey Meta" wake word.

In the <strong>Devices</strong> tab, tap the <strong>Translate</strong> button under your glasses. Then select which language you expect the other person to be speaking, as well as what "You speak." Meta will then download the necessary language pack(s).</p><p>Once that's set up, face the person you'll be speaking with and place the phone between the two of you. Then say, "Hey Meta, start live translation." Meta recommends that you speak clearly and at a "modest" pace so that the AI has no trouble translating your words. Whatever you say will be transcribed on your phone, while what the other person says will be spoken aloud over your glasses' speakers.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-connected-apps"><span>Connected apps</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BUGhas76oHZsfAVMaujh5B" name="oakley-meta-hstn-youtube-music" alt="Streaming YouTube Music on a pair of Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BUGhas76oHZsfAVMaujh5B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once you grant permissions, your Ray-Ban or Oakley Meta glasses can sync with:</p><ul><li>Phone apps (iOS and Android)</li><li>Messaging apps (Apple Messages, Google Messages, Messenger, WhatsApp)</li><li>Social apps (Facebook, Instagram)</li><li>Music/podcast apps (Amazon Music, Apple Music, Audible, Calm, iHeart, Shazam, Spotify)</li><li>Calendar apps (Google Calendar, Outlook)</li></ul><p>When using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android" target="_blank">music apps</a> or answering calls, it's a good idea to memorize the <strong>touchpad shortcuts</strong>. A <strong>single tap</strong> will pause or restart a song; a <strong>double-tap</strong> will skip to the next song or answer a phone call; a <strong>triple-tap</strong> will return to the previous song; a <strong>tap-and-hold</strong> will reject a call or trigger your music app to start playing if you assign that shortcut to it instead of Meta AI. <strong>Swiping up or down</strong> will increase or decrease the volume.</p><p>When it comes to calls and messaging, it's as simple as sharing your contacts with Meta so you can say, "Hey Meta, call Bob" or "send a message to Bob." If you connect multiple apps, you may need to add "on WhatsApp" or "on Messenger" at the end of the command.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GdRiG33v2ANhCApnn9TGKk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-messaging" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing text messaging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GdRiG33v2ANhCApnn9TGKk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta unsurprisingly saves its best tools for its own apps, where it can use direct integration instead of basic commands.

Likewise, you can <strong>share your glasses camera feed</strong> during a video call, but only by tapping a glasses icon in Messenger, WhatsApp, or Instagram.</p><p>When you take photos with your glasses, you can say, "Hey Meta, share my last photo to Facebook/Instagram," or you can specify to share it "to my Instagram/Facebook Story."</p><p>Meta will continue to add new app connections over time, as well as better commands for specific apps; you can bookmark the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/ai-glasses/1809764829519902/">Meta AI glasses release notes</a> to see the most recent updates.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-upcoming-vanguard-features"><span>Upcoming Vanguard features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="meZASeH7vZMVRJQTSHwMQE" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-and-Garmin-Venu-X1" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses and Garmin Venu X1 smartwatch sitting on a wooden board together." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/meZASeH7vZMVRJQTSHwMQE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta has confirmed that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-and-meta-team-up-on-new-smart-glasses-for-athletes">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> will launch on October 21, featuring a few fitness-focused AI and camera features, and that these features will eventually be available on other Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses.</p><p>First, Meta has teamed up with Garmin and Strava to <strong>sync your live workout activities</strong> with your glasses. You'll be able to ask, "What's my current pace?" and have the glasses deliver that information from your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> or Strava app. You'll be able to check info without breaking stride to swipe through watch menus or pull your phone out of your pocket.</p><p>Second, Meta's <strong>autocapture feature</strong> will "automatically capture video clips when you hit key distance milestones or ramp up your heart rate, speed, or elevation," creating memories from a race without having to take them manually.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BWfZmteW2MPX4ssMAMAdH" name="oakley-meta-vanguard-official-lifestyle-01" alt="An official lifestyle image of a person wearing Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BWfZmteW2MPX4ssMAMAdH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Third, Meta will add <strong>new video modes</strong> beyond the current 1080p or 3K recording settings. Specifically, you'll be able to create <strong>Slow Motion</strong> videos for dramatic extreme sports moments or <strong>Hyperlapse</strong> videos for extended tours of your activity route. The Vanguard glasses will have a second Action button that you can use to set up your video shortcut of choice.</p><p>Meta also told us that it'll create new <strong>single-word shortcuts</strong> sometime before the end of 2025. For example, instead of "Hey Meta, capture a photo," you'll simply say "Photo," and the always-listening assistant will do the rest. Meta will be the one to choose which shortcuts work, but it'll still be appreciated to trigger actions more quickly.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-ray-ban-display-features"><span>Meta Ray-Ban Display features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4NSfiFEdgymW9EkVKzMkSk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-recipe-tomato" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing a Meta AI prompt about a tomato recipe" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4NSfiFEdgymW9EkVKzMkSk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a> build on the smart glasses template, adding a built-in display. Most of the features on them are comparable, but with upgrades enabled by the HUD, such as the ability to see Meta AI responses in addition to hearing them, including images or (if relevant) step-by-step instructions in your vision, which you can then swipe through with Meta Neural Band gesture controls.</p><p>Taking photos with normal Ray-Ban/Oakley glasses is challenging because you don't know how close you need to be. The Display glasses solve this with a <strong>viewfinder</strong> previewing your shot, with the ability to <strong>zoom</strong> in or out by twisting your fingers. Plus, if you're into generative AI silliness, you can look at your finished shot and <strong>restyle</strong> it based on a text prompt before you upload it to social media.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a38SZoLvnDfpFWCi4BVsRk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-navigation" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing turn-by-turn navigation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a38SZoLvnDfpFWCi4BVsRk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you use Meta AI to look for something nearby, the Display glasses support <strong>pedestrian navigation</strong> to guide you to your destination, though only in "select cities" to start.</p><p>Meta smart glasses can show your perspective in a video call, but only the Display glasses can have it both ways, showing the person you're calling in your vision. You also get a full view of other apps, such as your Instagram feed, for scrolling through videos without it being visible to anyone else in the room.</p><p>Likewise, you can skip through a music playlist on smart glasses, but only the Display glasses will show the details and album artwork, so there's no suspense of what's coming next.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-live-captions" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing live captions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the best Meta Ray-Ban Display features is <strong>Live Captions</strong>, which transcribes in real time what the person in front of you is saying. The glasses' multi-array mics pinpoint who you're looking at so that any other conversations around you don't mess up the captions; if you turn to look at someone else, the text will switch to whatever they're saying.</p><p>The glasses will also enhance <strong>Live Translations</strong> so that you see people's translated responses in text form, as well as audibly.</p><p>Most Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses features are controlled by simple gestures or voice commands. One feature, currently in beta but coming to them soon, is the ability to <strong>write words on a desk or thigh</strong> and have them transcribed for a message or command; this will allow you to use the glasses silently and subtly during a meeting.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung jumping in earlier is expected to tighten the gap between Galaxy users and Pixel owners when it comes to getting new Android features.</p><p>Early signs of this change appeared in a leaked firmware build with SDK version 36.1 and the build prefix BP4A, both linked to Android 16 QPR2. This points to Samsung syncing its update schedule more closely with Google.</p><h2 id="google-s-trunk-stable-model-enables-the-shift-2">Google‚Äôs Trunk Stable model enables the shift</h2><p>A big part of that is thanks to Google‚Äôs Trunk Stable model, a framework that allows OEMs to integrate Android changes faster and with fewer headaches, as per Rahman. If Samsung sticks with this path, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">favorite Galaxy phones</a> could start getting Android‚Äôs newest tools without months of waiting around.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1235px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.45%;"><img id="ziRCzrVZ4gM6ScLpDdykCZ" name="One-UI-8.5-new-features" alt="new features spotted in One UI 8.5 builds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ziRCzrVZ4gM6ScLpDdykCZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1235" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1235px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.45%;"><img id="e8iPcphrR4njNRT7omAaEZ" name="One-UI-8.5-new-features" alt="new features spotted in One UI 8.5 builds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8iPcphrR4njNRT7omAaEZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1235" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>So, what‚Äôs in the pipeline with One UI 8.5? Quite a bit. On the interface side, users can expect an expanded dark theme, a forced icon theming option, lock screen widget support, and a universal cursor when using external displays. There‚Äôs also more granular control over haptic feedback and better APIs to adjust app layouts across different devices.</p><p>For media, Samsung is bringing in improvements like new AAudio APIs, an HDR/SDR brightness slider, enhanced media router privacy, and personal audio sharing via the output switcher.</p><p>Privacy and security get some key updates too. One UI 8.5 is expected to extend Identity Check to more apps, not just system features, while also adding USB-level protection, local parental controls, and toggles for phone theft protection.</p><p>It‚Äôs worth noting that not every feature spotted in this leaked build is guaranteed to make it into the final release. Still, the overall takeaway is that One UI 8.5 could be Samsung making a statement that it‚Äôs ready to deliver Android improvements faster, without leaving Galaxy users waiting until Android 17.</p> ]]></dc:content>
