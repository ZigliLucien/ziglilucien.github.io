Since then, millions of videos taken from GoPro cameras — and the myriad of similar wearable cameras it spawned — are littered across social media and film, alike. Using a GoPro to capture the moment when you're surfing, sky diving, mountain biking, or any other high-action moment lets you relive it again and again as if you were there.</p>

<p>But I'm not an amateur extreme sports participant and I don't want to buy special equipment to mount a camera like this somewhere. I just want a hands-free way to record video when I'm afraid dropping my phone might end in its ultimate demise. Thankfully, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> have filled this weird niche request.</p><p>You've seen the Superbowl commercial and we've been writing about them for nearly a year and a half since the original debut in October 2023, The product has only continued to improve since its release <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-glasses-just-got-their-most-futuristic-ai-update-yet">thanks to constant updates</a>. An uptick in interest has Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">ramping up production</a> and debuting more limited edition styles in the near future according to Meta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth. The next limited edition is coming this month, according to Meta's website.</p><p>I've been taking my Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses out with me for the last year since I got a pair, but my first winter with them proved to me how invaluable they can be for capturing the moment hands-free.</p>
<h2 id="keep-your-phone-in-your-pocket-2">Keep your phone in your pocket</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dPp2nNXoVTrhm92NFxzgxV" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-pocket-01" alt="Pulling the Ocean blue OnePlus 13 out of a pocket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dPp2nNXoVTrhm92NFxzgxV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've written lately about how keeping off your phone can improve your mental health. Your phone can even help you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-zen-mode-motorola-unplugged-samsung-relax">put it down with Zen Mode</a>, but in this case, I'm talking about keeping your phone in your pocket to keep <em>it</em> from physical harm. I recently went out snow sledding and didn't exactly want to take my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> out of my jacket pocket for fear it might end up buried in the snow somewhere.</p><p>Instead, a quick press of the button on my Ray-Ban Meta Glasses could take all the pictures and video I wanted, all without me having to hold a phone during the recording process. Heck, I could even do it completely hands-free by saying "Hey Meta, take a picture/record a video."</p><p>It's this effortless, hands-free nature that makes this product so darn appealing. I reviewed a handful of action cameras and GoPro's about a decade ago and while they were all cool, I never stuck with using them because they're not convenient for me. I'm not a hardcore sports player or adrenaline junkie so I never wanted to invest in the equipment needed to properly mount these devices somewhere.</p>

<p>Contrast this with the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses I've already got on my face — the transitions lenses ensures that I've got them on <em>all</em> the time — and you've got a great formula for capturing the moment any time you think about it. It's also much faster to take a picture or record a video than a phone could ever be.</p><p>Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/do-photography-focused-phones-make-any-sense">fastest photography-focused phones</a> take a full second longer to take a picture or record a video, and that's assuming you don't fumble the phone when trying to quickly take it out of your pocket. The glasses are right there on my face ready to go all the time and that's made them an invaluable part of the process for me.</p><p>The only times I wouldn't want to wear these was if there was a danger of them being submerged in water. They're IPX4 rated which means rain won't destroy them but they're not intended for diving or something like that. Remember, this is a casual way to record more, not a <em>complete</em> GoPro replacement for every situation.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-battery-life-and-image-quality-2">What about battery life and image quality?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/">battery life estimates</a> are surprisingly conservative. The company claims that "fully charged glasses last up to 4 hours for moderate usage (capturing and syncing up to 100 videos or up to 500 photos per full charge)." The default video length is 15-seconds, but I've found that I prefer to set it to 60-seconds and end the video early manually if I want.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>These glasses record roughly 33 minutes of video or several hundred photos captured before needing a charge.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In my testing, a 60-second video recording drains about 3% of the battery from the glasses. If you <em>only</em> recorded video using these settings, you'd get about 33 videos captured before the battery was dead. The default 15-second video length brings that up to over 130 videos before the battery is dead. Extrapolated, that means these record roughly 33 minutes of video on a full charge.</p><p>Most GoPro models can take a full hour of footage before needing a top-up, and you can buy an extended battery to make that last longer. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses have to be placed in their case to be charged, so there's no real way to amend the battery life <em>while</em> using them.</p><p>Thankfully, charging in the case is pretty fast. You'll get a 50% charge in about 20 minutes if the glasses were at 0% battery to start with. A full charge is about 75 minutes, so that second half takes quite a bit longer. That's another 15 minutes of video recording, if we're keeping track.</p><p>Turning off those cool AI features prolongs battery life even more, so if you don't want those features, that's an added bonus.</p>

<p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses record in a vertical format and, unlike the first gen, there's no way to adjust this aspect ratio in the settings. I'd venture to say that most media captured with these will make its way on social media at some point so the aspect ratio works well enough.</p><p>But what if you want to crop a video or image to make it 16:9 (or something else)? The results are good but not "smartphone level." If anything, they look like they were taken with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">a cheap phone</a> which, to be honest, is fine for many things. Above you'll find a few crops I took from photos so you can get the idea of the quality.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Physical zooming on a screenless pair of smart glasses doesn't make sense. Thankfully, the quality is good enough to crop photos afterward.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth said on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17860724019364783/?hl=en">March 3rd Instagram AMA</a> that camera zoom won't be coming to Ray-Ban glasses for a long time — if ever. The reasoning is that there's not enough physical space for optical zoom and fiddling with it without having a screen wouldn't make sense, anyway.</p><p>Dynamic range and color reproduction are the best qualities of these photos. They actually do a rather excellent job of capturing the moment and are even admirable with motion so long as you're recording during the day. The one freeze frame of my son sledding down the hill is good evidence of that.</p><p>It even has a clever AI-powered automatic leveling tool that'll ensure your photos aren't taken at a weird angle which I've found to work extremely well. In general, videos from the device are the real magic, anyway, but photo quality is good enough that you'll also find yourself using this function pretty often.</p>

<p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses are one of my favorite new types of products in years. I don't need anything as hardcore as a GoPro which makes these an ideal fit for my life and the things I regularly do. They're also good if you just want to take visual voice notes or send unique memories to friends and family.</p><p>One of my favorite videos recorded with Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses was a quick tour of a vacation house we rented last October where I ran through the house opening doors to show everyone what an amazing find the place was. I can't tell you how many people asked me how I recorded that video given that both my hands were visible throughout.</p><p>These examples might seem trivial at times but, once you have a pair and start recording, you'll quickly understand how amazing these glasses are and they make me excited for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">what's coming next</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is starting to roll out its monthly patch to a host of eligible Pixels in March following a major feature update.</p><p>The company posted its March 2025 security changelog <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/328762833/google-pixel-update-march-2025?hl=en&sjid=522863274191537897-NA">in its community</a>, stating the patch is available for the Pixel 6 series up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">the Pixel 9</a>, including the Fold, 9 Pro Fold, and Pixel Tablet. Users with a Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, and Pixel Fold will find update version BP1A.250305.019. The Pixel 9 series grabs vBP1A.250305.020 while the Tablet sees vBP1A.250305.020.<strong>T2</strong>.</p><p>In contrast to Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-february-2025-critical-security-patch-notes">light February patch</a>, its March security update brings a load of bug fixes across a majority of the Pixel lineup.</p><p>Google is rolling out a fix for display stability and performance issues concerning the Pixel Fold and Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Additionally, there's a camera and WebView stability fix arriving for every eligible Pixel for this month's security upgrade.</p><p>The company's entire Pixel lineup is also receiving a fix for system stability issues, as well as "improvements for network connection." Google highlights an audio issue, which plagued users attempting to adjust a call's volume when using a BT headset. The patch notes state this affects all Pixel devices, excluding the Pixel 6 series.</p><p>The remainder of the changelog for March is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Fix for issue occasionally causing color theme in launcher preview to not match with the selected wallpaper in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with home screen icons to appear transparent after unlocking or switching apps in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with switching between apps when using third party launchers in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue with themed icons in certain conditions</li><li>General improvements for performance and stability in certain UI transitions and animations</li></ul>

<p>In its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-03-01">Android Security Bulletin</a> notes, Google states Pixel users will download nine Framework fixes, all of them under its "High" severity label. For its Pixel Systems, the company states 21 fixes are arriving to ensure optimal security for users. The notes draw attention to two fixes, notably CVE-2024-43093 and CVE-2024-50302, which Google says "may be under limited, targeted exploitation."</p><p>Users are advised to download security patches as they come to ensure your devices are protected appropriately.</p><p>This monthly security patch is starting to arrive today (Mar. 4), only a few hours after Google dropped its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">huge Pixel feature drop</a>. The update is loaded with some killer features for phones and the Pixel Watch, like Loss of Pulse detection and Menstrual Cycle tracking/prediction for the Watch 3. Regarding its phones, Google says Pixels will soon receive scam detection alerts for texts and calls.</p><p>Moreover, the Find My Device app picks up location sharing between users and their trusted contacts.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus has confirmed that the OnePlus Watch 3 will receive three years of quarterly updates through 2027.</li><li>It previously told us that it would only receive two years of support, which is shorter than most other Wear OS watches.</li><li>Both the OnePlus Watch 3 and 2 will receive two version updates up to Wear OS 7 and 6, respectively.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>When OnePlus originally told us and other sites that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3</a> would stop at two years of security updates, it was a frustrating disappointment. But it appears to have been a simple miscommunication: OnePlus contacted us to confirm that both the Watch 2 and Watch 3 will receive "3 years of quarterly security updates."</p><p>They'll also receive "3 years of software updates," though not three <em>version</em> updates: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> launched with Wear OS 4 and will stop at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> in 2026. The OnePlus Watch 3 will eventually receive Wear OS 7 in 2027.</p><p>Compared to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>, the OnePlus Watch 3 will match the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> with three years of security support — though the latter will get one more version update and speedier support. Samsung, meanwhile, promises <em>four</em> years of version and security updates for its Galaxy Watches.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 has incredible battery life for a Wear OS watch at five days per charge, beating Google and Samsung for longevity. But two years of security support made the Watch 3 harder to recommend when Google, Samsung, and Apple watches would get patched with fixes and enhancements for much longer. With this misunderstanding resolved, the Watch 3 looks more appealing to Android users.</p><p>OnePlus will still have slower version updates than Google and Samsung. The Watch 2 and 2R are due to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> between July and September, about a year after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> launched with it. But that seems to have become the norm for third-party Wear OS watches, and later is better than never.</p>

<p>I originally wrote about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-has-set-interesting-standard-with-wear-os-5-and-oneplus-watch-3">my confusion and frustration</a> with the Watch 3's two-year update plan, since it suggested that it would stop receiving security updates <em>before</em> it got its last version update in 2027. So I'm relieved to have the issue clarified. And generally speaking, OnePlus's Watch 3 messy launch has distracted from how excited we are about this watch's potential.</p><p>OnePlus faced some amused mockery when someone spotted a "Meda in China" typo on the Watch 3's bottom. It eventually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-pushes-open-sale-of-watch-3-after-meda-error">delayed the watch's release to April</a> to fix the typo and sent the first batch of watches out with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-pre-orders-are-arriving-with-an-apology-letter">apology letter</a>, even though most people likely would never have noticed the tiny disclaimer hidden against their wrist.</p><p>More importantly, OnePlus promised that they are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-promises-to-fix-two-key-watch-3-downsides-this-year">"working on" fixing two key Watch 3 downsides</a> "this year." Specifically, they know the 1.5-inch Watch 3 is too large for some wrists and are developing a smaller model; and they're talking with carriers to try and bring LTE cellular support to their watches outside of China.</p><p>If you look past the critiques and self-inflicted errors, OnePlus has plenty to be proud of with the Watch 3, from its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-smartwatches-have-a-flicker-problem-the-oneplus-watch-3-fixed-it">eye-friendly display</a> to the impressive battery life that dwarfs the competition, not to mention its blazingly fast charging speed. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">Watch 2-to-3 upgrades</a> are significant enough that we already consider the Watch 3 one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> on the market.</p>

<hr>
<p>A recent wave of rumors surfaces, detailing what users may see next year with Samsung's Ultra flagship.</p><p>X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PandaFlashPro/status/1896248480148156834">PandaFlash</a> highlighted in a few separate posts speculation on the supposed hardware features of the Galaxy S26 Ultra (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/03/04/rumored-galaxy-s26-ultra-upgrades-may-disappoint-you/">Gizmochina</a>). The tipster starts with a claim that goes against other rumors about a UDC (under-display camera). Apparently, Samsung will continue to offer a punch-hole selfie camera instead of a seamless display for the S26 Ultra.</p><p>The tipster replied to another user, stating the device could still rock the same 12MP selfie camera.</p><p>Instead of a camera change, rumors suggest a change could hit the design of the S26 Ultra's display. In their thread, the tipster states the next Ultra will see its bezels further reduced (when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>). They then shared <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PandaFlashPro/status/1896533108784288135">a mock render</a> of what this could look like. At a glance, it seems the "thinner bezels" will be minimal as there isn't much of a noticeable change. But, that could change.</p><p>The topic of the device's charging capabilities was highlighted, to which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PandaFlashPro/status/1896322570686968128">the tipster states</a> the S26 Ultra could see "between 45W to 50W." The tipster alleges information regarding a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PandaFlashPro/status/1896881142151967042">test version</a>" of the Galaxy S26 Ultra, stating it features the following storage sizes: 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB — nothing new.</p><p>Additionally, the device has retained S Pen support similar to the S25 Ultra.</p>

<p>What the tipster's final point is referring to is likely the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">removal of Bluetooth</a> support (Bluetooth Low Energy) from the S Pen.

The company stated less than 1% of its users utilized the S Pen's Air Actions via Bluetooth, which is roughly 158,000 consumers.</p><p>Galaxy S26 Ultra rumors have been light; however, one that stands out surfaced in January about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-richer-more-efficient-galaxy-s26-ultra-screen-rumor">more efficient display</a>. A South Korea report alleged Samsung could grant its next Ultra a display could suck up less energy, but deliver a richer and brighter color experience. The company is rumored to seek out COE screen tech to get this done. Not only could the S26 Ultra's display utilize "color filters" instead of an underlying polarizer, but the device could use a Black PDL to reduce the chance of external light obstructions.</p><p>Elsewhere, rumors say Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-200mp-periscope-telephoto-development-rumored">reportedly beginning tests</a> for a 200MP telephoto lens for future Ultra phones. The company is reportedly developing a 1/1.5-inch sensor to achieve this feat, which is speculated to land on the S26 Ultra.</p>

<hr>
<p>Recent rumors suggest Samsung is getting a little more serious about a new in-house chip for next year's flagship series.</p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fnnews.com/news/202503041334142105">FNNews</a> (Korean) report claims the Korean OEM has created a "performance improvement task force" to oversee everything concerning the Exynos 2600 SoC (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-is-betting-big-on-exynos-2600-for-upcoming-galaxy-s26-series/">SammyGuru</a>). Samsung's Foundry business is supposedly feeling pressure to kick up the "urgency" about the chip's performance levels. Aside from performance, the report states the company is looking into enhancing the "stabilization" of the Exynos 2600.</p><p>Samsung's Foundry and LSI Divisions are said to be focusing all efforts on these key areas to prepare for its next-gen series <em>and </em>to better compete against other manufacturers.</p><p>The Korean publication states this "task force" was created "preemptively to secure performance competitiveness compared to competitors' products." Specifically, it's supposed insider claims this is about Qualcomm and MediaTek's respective flagship SoCs.</p><p>Meanwhile, the post reiterates a few aspects of the chip: it will likely be based off a 2nm process and Samsung could pop it into the Galaxy S26 series. The post states Samsung could look to enter mass-production of the Exynos 2600 by May. However, a final decision about its implementation in the Galaxy S26 will come "by the end of this year."</p>

<p>Samsung has had a rocky history with its in-house chips as of late, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-starts-work-on-its-2nm-process-chip">a report last May claimed</a> it would enter mass-production by 2025. Those early rumors stated the Exynos 2600, built on a 2nm process, could deliver a 12% increase in performance, a 25% in overall power efficiency, and a 5% decrease in total area. This was followed up by another South Korean report several months later, claiming Samsung was looking at the Exynos 2600 "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-rumors-galaxy-s26-exynos-change">significantly</a>" for the S26 series.</p><p>The report claimed the company was interested in moving away from its reliance on other manufacturers, namely Qualcomm, for its flagship series. In short, this would help Samsung cut costs as its SoC comes from within. Costs were a point highlighted by the FNNews report, as well.</p><p>That report about its significant use didn't explain <em>which </em>consumers were in an Exynos waiting room. However, looking at the Galaxy S24 series, it had an Exynos variant available in Europe, India, and the U.K. Speculation says Samsung <em>might </em>keep Qualcomm's next flagship SoC for its U.S. market, but that remains to be seen.</p>

<ul><li>Google Pixel's exclusive AI assistant is said to make its way to the upcoming Google Pixel 10 this fall.</li><li>Dubbed 'Pixel Sense,' the assistant will be showcased as an app that will be a 'smart and context-aware' assistant.</li><li>It is said to cross-communicate between apps, processing user's metadata to predict actions for them.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Talk of Google Pixel's exclusive AI-powered Assistant has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixie-pixel-9-report">been doing the rounds since 2023</a>. The assistant was then internally called "Pixie," and was expected to show up on Google's Pixel 9 series — which didn't end up happening.</p><p>But looks like the company hasn't given up on the "Pixie" dream as yet, since it seems like it had bigger plans for the AI assistant. According to internal sources, Google is working on bringing "Pixie" to the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a>, under a new name dubbed Pixel Sense (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-sense-3531570/" target="_blank">first reported by Android Authority</a>).</p><p>The publication states that Pixel Sense will show up as an app for new-gen phones, which the tech giant said will give users the "most personalized experience based on the things you do on your Pixel.” We knew early on that this Pixel-exclusive assistant is said to utilize user data collected by various Google apps like Calendar, and Gmail. However, Android Authority adds that the Assistant will also be able to process "media files, including text, images, AI-generated content, and associated metadata."</p><p>Google explains that when a user takes screenshots, Pixel Sense will process them to understand metadata and learn from it. This will help when the user searches for specific screenshots on the app.</p>

<p>Additionally, Google states that this Assistant will have the ability to provide predictive suggestions, based on the usage patterns of the device. "It will also be able to suggest places, products, and names, right when you need them,” Google told Android Authority.</p><p>We asked Gemini about what Pixie could do and it stated that the core focus of Pixel Sense is to 'create a smart and context-aware assistant' that basically knows what you're going to do next. From the looks of it, Pixel Sense will operate primarily on a Google Pixel phone, minimizing the device's need to reach out to Google's servers. "Your data stays private, visible only to you, not even Google can see it,” the publication added.</p><p>It remains unclear how different Pixel Sense will be from Gemini. But we think it will highly rely on Gemini's capabilities and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-gemini-nano-available-for-all-android-apps">Gemini Nano</a> for its on-device actions. The key difference however is the way data is showcased. Gemini is an Open Language Learning Model that gets its knowledge from Google's servers, whereas Pixel Sense will keep things limited to the user's device. It will be cool to watch this in action on the Pixel 10 that is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">rumored</a> to arrive later this fall.</p>

While the offers on display are certainly impressive — especially if you&apos;re looking for a trade-in opportunity — there&apos;s one <em>no-strings</em> discount that you could easily miss if you aren&apos;t careful. Buy the 256GB configuration of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 in White and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uzwaxaa/"><strong>you&apos;ll score a massive $600 discount on the unlocked phone</strong></a>, totally destroying the current offers from retailers like Best Buy and Amazon. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is a powerful foldable phone with two stunning AMOLED displays, a Snapdragon chipset, and all the useful Galaxy AI features that you could ever need. It's also quite expensive, which is why I was surprised to see the phone score a straight $600 discount during the Discover Samsung Spring Sale, but <em>only</em> if you buy the 256GB configuration in White. </p>
<p>Although the deal doesn't require a trade-in, if you're looking to get rid of an old or broken phone, Samsung is also offering up to $1,000 of trade-in credit for the duration of the sale. </p>
<p><strong>💰Bundle opportunities: </strong><em>25% off Galaxy Ring, 40% off Galaxy Watch 7</em><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uzwaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8a238bc5-61bd-4602-9766-86cab755a9ec" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 256GB (in White): $1,899.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 256GB (in White): $1,899.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>
<p>As I mentioned above, the only real catch attached to this deal is that you&apos;ll need to buy the phone with 256GB of storage AND in White to receive the savings. Not a fan of the color variant? Simply use some of that leftover cash to pick up one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-cases">best Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 cases</a>. </p><p>Unlike a lot of the deals featured at Samsung this week, this Galaxy Z Fold 6 discount doesn&apos;t require a trade-in. That being said, if you <em>do</em> have an old phone to get rid of, the retailer is offering up to $1,000 of trade-in credit for eligible devices, such as the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Z Fold 5. </p><p>Easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> on the market today, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 features two vibrant 120Hz displays with S Pen stylus support, the excellent Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, and a bounty of AI-boosted software features. The biggest problem I have with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is its steep price tag, but lucky for us, this Samsung deal has come along to lessen the blow. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>MWC 2025 has come to an end, and there was so much to see, so many things to do! Managing Editor Derrek Lee and Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda were both in Spain this year and had the opportunity to hand out awards to some well-deserving companies. <br><br>This annual event gives companies a chance to show off their most recent products, introduce and tease new or upcoming devices, or reveal concepts that may never reach store shelves (but are still fun to play with).</p><p>There are definitely some products that really stuck with the team. With that in mind, here's what made it into the list for the best of MWC 2025.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-phone-xiaomi-15-ultra"><span>Best phone: Xiaomi 15 Ultra</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WiNZKYRrM73LqtxiExhwA7" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WiNZKYRrM73LqtxiExhwA7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the 15 Ultra, Xiaomi once again proves that it knows how to deliver a terrific camera package. The return of the 1-inch main camera alongside a new 200MP tele lens gives the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> versatility like no other phone available today, and it takes outstanding photos and videos in any lighting condition.</p><p>There's plenty to like with the rest of the hardware; the design is much better than in previous years, and Xiaomi has a two-tone color option that's evocative. Gaming isn't a problem at all, but there have been instances where the device overheats. It easily lasts over a day, the AMOLED panel is brighter than last year, and the software is optimized well. Basically, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has all the ingredients to be one of the best phones of 2025.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-foldable-phone-oppo-find-n5"><span>Best foldable phone: OPPO Find N5</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eKjWtvtti3KobiBqXecGi4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 in Flex Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eKjWtvtti3KobiBqXecGi4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a> solves one of the biggest pain points of foldables — size. Thanks to its ultra-thin design, it feels like a regular phone in daily use; even while folded, it is just 8.93mm thick, and that's thinner even than the Xiaomi 15 Ultra — a considerable achievement.</p><p>But it's when you unfold the Find N5 that you understand the magnitude of OPPO's innovation. Coming in at just 4.21mm, the foldable is thinner than any other book-style device, and it is an absolute joy to use. You also get one of the best foldable camera packages, class-leading battery life, two fantastic OLED panels, and useful software features designed to maximize the potential of the tablet-sized inner panel.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-value-phone-nothing-phone-3a-pro"><span>Best value phone: Nothing Phone 3a Pro</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ZPZxwS59kxw47f4MruP2mU" name="nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-3a-pro-back-05" alt="Comparing the transparent backs of the grey Nothing Phone (3a) Pro with the white Nothing Phone (3a)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZPZxwS59kxw47f4MruP2mU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a Pro</a> is proof that you don't need to pay a lot of money to get a great phone. It has Nothing's distinctive design, but because of the addition of a new 50MP tele lens at the back, the camera island is distinctly busier than previous models. We like the new design, but it is polarizing, and Nothing admits as much.</p><p>The plus side is that you get two great 50MP cameras on the back of the Phone 3a Pro, and the inclusion of 3x optical zoom gives it much better usability in real-world scenarios. The hardware is better than last year, and it does a good job with gaming, the battery lasts a day, and the custom Nothing OS 3.1 software is the best you'll see on any budget phone. The clean interface with bold widgets and styling gives the Phone 3a Pro a sizable advantage, and it will get more software updates than any other device in this category — an added bonus.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-concept-phone-tecno-phantom-ultimate-2"><span>Best concept phone: TECNO Phantom Ultimate 2</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4042px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="2F7ehSmfSEY2rgrY35YpUL" name="TECNO-Phantom-Ultimate-2" alt="The TECNO Phantom Ultimate 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2F7ehSmfSEY2rgrY35YpUL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4042" height="2274" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">TECNO Phantom Ultimate 2</a> was teased in the latter half of 2024, and it impressed us with the fact that despite being a multi-fold phone, it was still thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> at just 11mm thick. That said, no one got to see it in person until MWC 2025, where the phone was on display in all its multi-fold glory.</p><p>It's actually quite shocking how thin the phone is in person. It protrudes on one side where the cameras are housed, which is par for the course with most smartphones these days. However, the massive 10-inch display is quite a sight to behold when fully unfolded. TECNO was unable to provide much in the way of specs, which is fair given this is just a concept, but the phone feels quite solid, and we hope that it makes its way into consumer hands soon.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-accessory-aurzen-zip-tri-fold-projector"><span>Best accessory: Aurzen ZIP Tri-Fold Projector</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xU3G3AypqstUAqtvfzu2Pa" name="Aurzen ZIP Tri-Fold Projector" alt="Aurzen ZIP Tri-Fold Projector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xU3G3AypqstUAqtvfzu2Pa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Tri-fold phones are slowly becoming a thing, but this portable projector is also diving into the tri-fold space. The Aurzen ZIP Tri-Fold Projector features a pocketable design that's just 1 inch when folded and weighs less than an iPhone. It outputs a 720p picture that makes it easy to view video and images from your phone on a larger canvas.</p><p>There are actually many ways to connect to the projector; you can just cast using your phone, and there's an HDMI receiver built into the product, so you can use it with just about any device.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-wearable-device-xiaomi-watch-s4"><span>Best wearable device: Xiaomi Watch S4</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="r8wjePWURxzw5cBzkBmM8e" name="Xiaomi Watch S4" alt="Xiaomi Watch S4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r8wjePWURxzw5cBzkBmM8e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last year's S3 was one of the best budget smartwatches around, and the S4 builds on that foundation. It has a bright AMOLED panel, decent internals, excellent battery life, and Health Connect integration. The smartwatch continues to be highly customizable, with Xiaomi making it easy to switch out the bands and even alter the color of the dial. There's a rotating crown, it lasts 15 days between charges, and at 1,500 nits, this is the brightest smartwatch in its category. And best of all, it is a great value.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-xr-device-rayneo-x3-pro"><span>Best XR device: RayNeo X3 Pro</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KaCgGjpcNMQpQTBPhg7dUh" name="RayNeo X3 Pro" alt="RayNeo X3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KaCgGjpcNMQpQTBPhg7dUh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>RayNeo's X3 Pro are upcoming AR glasses that run on Qualcomm's AR1 Gen 1. The glasses pack a considerable amount of hardware into a tiny chassis, and they include a custom optical engine that allows the glasses to be thinner and lighter. The micro-LED panel gets up to 2,500 nits, and a high-res camera is integrated into the glasses that lets you record your surroundings. Basically, the X3 Pro is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> rival that aims to make AR much more accessible, and RayNeo is also bundling a suite of useful AI features into the glasses.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-ai-innovation-honor-alpha-plan"><span>Best AI innovation: Honor Alpha Plan</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FgDVCyYbZzA2MJpoGx72XC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro search using AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgDVCyYbZzA2MJpoGx72XC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To say that Honor is going all-in on AI would be an understatement. The Chinese manufacturer has pledged $10 billion toward AI innovation over the next decade, and it is positioning its devices as part of an overarching AI ecosystem. The Alpha plan consists of three pillars: create a phone with an agentic AI, build an open ecosystem, and collaborate with global partners to deliver new AI use cases. It is a bold vision to say the least, and it will be interesting to see how Honor leverages the potential of on-device and cloud AI models to differentiate itself — and its products.</p>

<ul><li>Google's March feature drop is here, bringing scam detection alerts for texts and calls to Pixel users.</li><li>The Pixel Watch 3 will receive its Loss of Pulse detection feature by the "end of March," but users should soon receive its Menstrual Cycle tracking and prediction.</li><li>The feature drop expands Find My Device app's usefulness for locations while users on Verizon and T-Mobile see a Satellite SOS expansion.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>March is here, and so is Google's expected feature drop for Pixels and Pixel Watches for all eligible users.</p><p>The year's first feature drop brings a load of new Pixel features, beginning with AI-powered scam detection. In a press release, Google informs Pixel 6 and newer devices are receiving suspicious text alerts. The company says these devices will leverage on-device AI to "flag text patterns commonly associated with scams." The post states these safety measures should help protect users from having their personal information fall into the hands of wrongdoers.</p><p>Similarly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 devices</a> in the U.S. are picking up the same scam protection measures for calls in the U.S. Google says its on-device AI will monitor for "conversation patterns" that scammers typically use to safeguard you and your information. Like texting, this feature is hitting Pixel 9 devices today (Mar. 4).</p><p>Google's Find My Device app now lets users share their location with "trusted contacts." Dubbed "Live Location," users can show where they are with a contact who can view it on a map from their phone or tablet.</p><p>Pixel Fold users are getting a small update, which brings video recording support to Dual Screen. Google states users can now utilize the phone's cover display to view what's being recorded. Elsewhere, Pixel 9 Pro Fold owners grab <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> for Dual Screen, the AI-powered feature that lets you smartly edit yourself or others into a group photo.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pixel 9 devices receive gain support for multiple cameras for streaming. Google states you can "Connect your Pixel phone with a GoPro or other Pixel phone camera, and use popular social apps to stream from different angles."</p><p>Satellite communication capabilities are being expanded in March, with Google stating its Pixel Satellite SOS is arriving in Europe, Canada, and more for the Pixel 9. This lets users who've gone out of cell service range to remain connected with family and the world around them. Google states users should understand that this is arriving in beta, so there may be issues.</p><p>Pixel 9 series users are also getting in on satellite messaging via Verizon and T-Mobile.</p><p>Google's AI software Gemini is coming to two new countries: Japan and Germany.

<p>Google's Pixel Watch isn't being ignored this month as leading off the March feature drop is the arrival of its Loss of Pulse detection. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-gets-fda-approval-for-loss-of-pulse-detection-in-us">recently reported</a> that the FDA had signaled its approval of Google's new life emergency feature which, according to the company, will begin rolling out in the U.S. "by the end of March."</p><p>Google reiterates this approval, stating it has "received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for our Loss of Pulse Detection feature starting with Pixel Watch 3." If your Pixel Watch 3 cannot detect your heart beat anymore, it will automatically call emergency services if it's unable to reach you first.</p><p>Another major addition is Menstrual Cycle tracking on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>. Users can now log their period, view cycle status, or see a prediction about the next one from the Watch 3.</p><p>All Pixel Watches are picking up better step accuracy. Google states its wearables will now better detect when you've "deviated" from your typical walking patterns to avoid a miscount. It hopes this can better aid users trying to hit their walking goals and see more reliable daily insights.</p><p>Google is also expanding its Automatic Bedtime mode to the Pixel Watch 2. Through this, the watch will try and detect when you've fallen asleep and "turn off your watch face and disable notifications to minimize distractions." Pixel Watches are also receiving new media playback control actions such as fast forward, rewind, playback speed, and playback queue controls.</p><p>Lastly, the Pixel Recorder app's auto-transcribe function is hitting Pixel 6 and newer phones, as well as Google's Pixel Watches and Tablets.</p>

<ul><li>New leaks reveal official cases of the upcoming Pixel 9a alongside some renders.</li><li>On the other hand, the Pixel 9a has also hit the FCC certification, indicating the flagship satellite connectivity feature is coming to the handset.</li><li>The device hitting the FCC listing also means the launch is expected sooner rather than later.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s next product is evidently the Pixel 9a, which is yet to get a release date. While we await its launch, we already know what to expect — thanks to numerous leaks so far. However, some new details emerge of the mid-range handset as some more renders and cases emerge next to an FCC listing as well.</p><p>Leaker Arsène Lupin on X (formerly Twitter) has shared some renders of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a>, which appear familiar to what we have seen in the earlier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">leaked renders</a> of the handset.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/cZYpB1XBdy<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1896629986657976690">March 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The device could feature rounded corners, and flat edges, and the large Pixel’s signature rectangular camera visor is no longer present; instead, the Pixel 9a settles with a regular pill-shaped camera visor flushing right into the rear panel.</p><p>The shared renders include black, silver, and purple colorways, and a pink one like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series is also expected. These renders also match the earlier-witnessed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-real-life-images-leak-again">real hands-on</a> images of the handset, which occurred in multiple instances. Next to the renders, tipster Lupin has also shared the accompanying official cases of the Pixel 9a, which appear to be silicone-made.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/eIHlK4yYqI<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1896629235839869206">March 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>On the other hand, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.droid-life.com/2025/03/03/pixel-9a-has-gone-through-the-fcc/">DroidLife</a> has managed to view the recent FCC certification of the Pixel 9a, which means the device launch could be happening sooner rather than later. The certification site has revealed three Google phones bearing GXQ96, GTF7P, and G3Y12 model numbers. While the certification doesn’t reveal the entirety of the handset, we get to know some tidbits about the handset, like its support for Wi-Fi 6E, NFC, and wireless charging.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the FCC certification also reveals a digital label explaining that “the satellite feature on this device must be turned off at all times while on board an aircraft by turning on airplane mode.”</p><p>A similar label was found for the Pixel 9 series; henceforth, we could see support for the satellite communication feature on the Pixel 9a, which will be commendable as the device is tailored for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phone</a> segment.</p><p>Since the device has hit the FCC listing already, we can expect the launch of the Pixel 9a to happen soon, as mentioned. As DroidLife points out, the Pixel 9 series hit the FCC in July last year, and the devices were launched in August. Going by that fact, since the Pixel 9a has hit the certification in February, we expect it to be coming later this month.</p>

<hr>
<p>At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/mwc-2025">MWC 2025</a>, TECNO officially launched its latest smartphones, the Camon 40 series, which consists of four new phones. Leading the lot is the Camon 40 Premier 5G, which is powered by a "MediaTek Dimensity 8350 Ultimate" for enhanced AI processing.</p><p>The company is really leaning on its photography and AI chops with its new phones, especially after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tecno-ai-foldable-strategy-interview">unveiling its AI vision</a> last year. The Camon 40 Premier 5G sports a 50MP Sony LYT-701 sensor that is capable of capturing very fast subjects with the company's new FlashSnap technology. This improves camera startup and capture times so users can capture moments on the spot without worrying about blurry subjects.</p>

<p>In addition, the Camon 40 Premier 5G also has a 50MP ultrawide and a 50MP periscope telephoto lens. The phone takes advantage of TECNO's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-advanced-skin-tone-phantom-ultimate-2-mwc-2025-teaser">improved Universal Tone technology</a>, which enhances skin tone reproduction in images. The phone is also capable of underwater photography, thanks to the IP68 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> water resistance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QYDjUozYQccEP2HTzSFw9H" name="TECNO-Camon-40-Premier-5G-water-resistance" alt="TECNO Camon 40 Premier 5G wet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QYDjUozYQccEP2HTzSFw9H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4070" height="2290" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to photography, the Camon 40 Premier 5G brings all of TECNO's AI features under one device. This includes functions like Call Translation, AI Eraser 2.0, Image Extender, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>. The phone continues to depend on its Ella AI assistant, which functions more or less like Gemini for contextual responses to queries and more.</p>
<p>The Camon 40 series comes in configurations up to 12GB/256GB, although it will depend on the model. And while TECNO promises great battery life, the Premier 5G scores a 5,100mAh battery and 70W fast charging, beating out many higher-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p><p>Pricing and availability weren't immediately available, but knowing TECNO, the Camon 40 series will be priced affordably with reach in markets outside of the United States.</p>

<p>In addition to new Android phones, TECNO is also launching two new AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>. The aptly named TECNO AI Glasses look fairly similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, including the camera placement on the side.</p><p>The smart glasses connect to Android and are equipped with support for TECNO's Ella AI assistant for language translation, object recognition, and more. There is a 50MP camera with a 100-degree field of vision, which can be used for photos.</p><p>Both the AI Glasses and AI Glasses Pro are mostly identical, although the design differs between them, with a thicker frame on the latter. That's because the Pro model has displays built into the lenses, which can be used to view navigation, translations in real-time, and more. The camera is also placed in between the lenses for a more distinct design, while the standard AI Glasses look a bit more svelte.</p>

<p>Otherwise, both AI glasses will get more than 11 days of battery life, depending on how they're used. The glasses are also controlled via touch and come with IPX4 protection.</p><p>For now, TECNO has not yet revealed pricing and availability for the AI Glasses, and we're still waiting to learn about the chipset powering the glasses.</p>

<p>Feature drops are something Google Pixel users look forward to, and the search giant seems to be pushing out more of these lately. Last week, we saw some Workspace drops for Google Sheets, Google Drive, Gemini Deep Research, and Notebook LLM (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/28/google-workspace-feature-drops-are-now-a-thing/">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Gemini is bringing some notable new AI capabilities to Google Sheets, which will be based on advanced multi-step code generation. These capabilities are likely to help generate deeper insights regarding contextual trends, patterns, or correlations between variables in data provided in Sheets.</p><p>Further, to provide advanced visual insights, it will also be able to generate advanced chart types, like heat maps, for example.</p>

<p>Here’s one of the few examples cited by the search giant in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/february-workspace-feature-drop">announcement blog post</a>:</p><p>“A small business owner managing cash flow can ask "Predict my net income for the next quarter based on historical data" to proactively identify potential shortfalls.”</p><p>Google Sheets users will also see some improvements, like pasting speeds significantly improved by up to 50% when copying between spreadsheets. Further, a 50% faster filter menu loading speed is available for larger datasets, which can include several unique values. And, getting data should be quicker as well, because existing spreadsheets are claimed to open up 30% quicker.</p>

<p>After announcing the automatic generation of captions for uploaded videos on Google Drive last year, Google is now introducing a video transcripts feature for videos to make them easier to discover and reference when required.</p><p>Drive users will be able to view and search transcripts for videos with captions. The transcript can be viewed right next to the video player, which will automatically highlight the spoken text in the video. It further allows users to jump to the preferred part while watching the video by clicking on the transcript.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-notebooklm-limited-launch">NotebookLM</a>, the search giant’s popular AI research assistant, is now incorporated as a core service for Workspace Business and Enterprise consumers. The Assistant looks at the users’ organization's data to generate insights and accelerate learning. For the said consumers, it includes the same enterprise-grade data protections and level of technical support as other core Workspace apps.</p><p>Similarly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-feature-expands-to-more-languages-and-regions">Gemini Deep Research</a> is also now available for Google Workspace customers. It helps in exploring complex topics on users’ behalf and converts its findings into a comprehensive and easy-to-read format, cutting a lot of time for people trying to piece information together.</p><p>Those comprehensive reports can further be exported to Google Docs and quickly shared with the team. Users can find the generated reports neatly organized with relevant links to dig even more. Further follow-up questions can be asked to make the report even more refined.</p>

In the same way, "Nothing" means something more than the surface value that most people might take it for. These two Android smartphone brands launched with the promise of reeling in more than just the enthusiast segment, but while Nothing has owned the Essential brand for a few years, we didn't understand why until the Nothing Phone 3a came along.</p><p>Enter the Essential Key. It's a new key located below the power button that activates Nothing's newfound AI organization system, Essential Space. Essential Space organizes screenshots, voice notes, and text notes taken when you tap or long-press the key. It's like a physical DayMinder in phone form, and it tries to prove that AI isn't some silly, useless addition to our phones. It's essential.</p><p>Beyond that, Nothing Phone 3a marks the first time the company is launching more than one phone model at a time. Phone 3q and Phone 3a Pro give users a choice of design and camera specs. The designs are iconic, and the prices are great, but are these phones essential? So long as you don't live in the U.S., definitely.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, Nothing is selling two different models in the same product line. The Nothing Phone 3a represents the most affordable version of the new line, starting at £329 / €329 / ₹24,999 for the model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Customers in India can get a version with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage for ₹26,999.</p><p>Power users looking to save money should pick up the version with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for £379 / $379 / €379. The Nothing Phone 3a is available in Black or White, and a special Blue color is available in the UK and India.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro drops the number of colors to just Grey and Black, but Nothing was careful to ensure that the transparent nature of the phone doesn't get lost in darker designs, as was the case with Phone 2a. Nothing Phone 3a features two India-exclusive models, both with 8GB of RAM. That 128GB storage model is ₹29,999, while the 256GB storage model is ₹31,999. Otherwise, you can also purchase a model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for £449 / $459 / €459 / ₹33,999.</p><p>Nothing Phone 3a preorders begin on March 4 at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://nothing.tech/" target="_blank">nothing.tech</a> and will launch on March 11. Nothing Phone 3a Pro preorders start on March 11 from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://nothing.tech/" target="_blank">nothing.tech</a>, and the phone will see open sales on March 25. Nothing offers three major Android updates and six years of security updates on the Nothing Phone 3a series.</p>
<h2 id="a-word-on-u-s-availability-2">A word on U.S. availability</h2>
<p>U.S. customers will need to order the phone from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.nothing.tech/pages/beta-program">Nothing Beta Program</a>. Nothing says it's still only selling through that program, as Nothing Phone 3a models currently don't support the full range of bands needed to work on AT&T and Verizon's networks. I used my Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro review units on T-Mobile 5G with no reception issues.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-specs"><span>Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro: Specs</span></h2>

<p>Both phones offer identical base specs. Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro share the same RAM and storage configurations, Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset, the same display, IP64 ingress rating, battery size, charging speed, and connectivity support.</p><p>Upgrading to a Nothing Phone (3a) Pro gets you a better main rear camera sensor with dual-pixel PDAF, an upgraded telephoto camera with a 3x periscope lens and a much larger Sony sensor behind it with OIS, plus a substantially larger and higher-resolution selfie camera.</p>

<p>The single most defining thing about a Nothing Phone is its design. Nothing (ha!) on the market looks like a Nothing Phone. Even phones with transparent backs — of which there are very few — don't look like a Nothing Phone because Nothing goes out of its way to create a transparent <em>design</em> rather than just letting you look at the phone's components.</p><p>Nothing's design-forward nature inherently differentiates it from <em>anything</em> in the mid-range space. Most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">phones in this price range</a> look more or less identical, and Nothing's designs should be celebrated for this reason, especially since Nothing took the criticisms of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>'s color choices to heart, ensuring that "components" are now visible and prominent on the back even if you choose a darker color.</p><p>Phone 3a packs in a triple camera system for the first time in an A-series phone, elongating the camera bar on the back. That looks a lot better in my eyes, as the 2a's two-camera hump looked a little odd to me. Phone 3a Pro swaps that out with a very large, circular camera island that's going to be a bit polarizing. While I love the look, it's very dramatic and super industrial, which isn't something everyone will like.</p>

<p>Both phones sport glass backs and IP64 water and dust resistance, giving them a more premium look and durability enhancements over the Phone 2a series. The sides are still plastic but they have a nice texture to them that gives them grip rather than feeling slippery as some shiny plastic can.</p><p>The other defining factor of Nothing's phone design is the Glyph Interface on the back, which blinks and flashes for notifications, calls, timer countdowns, and more. It's the same 3-LED strip found on Phone 2a, not the larger full-back design from Phone 1 and Phone 2, but fun apps like Glyph Composer let you make your own ringtones and notification sounds complete with matching LED blinks.</p><p>If these phones have anything, it's character and lots of it.

<figure><blockquote><p>Having a dedicated hardware key to take notes or voice memos is a game-changer, especially since AI organizes them for you.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>On the software front, Nothing has done a good job differentiating the look of its software over the years but hasn't always offered too many "must-have" features until Essential Space came along. Essential Space launches with the Phone 3a series and is accessible via the new Essential Key on the right side of the phone underneath the power button.</p><p>Pressing this button takes a quick screenshot followed by a brief dialog that allows you to take a manual note attached to it. Long-pressing and holding lets you take a voice memo that's active until you let go of the button. All of these can be found in the new Essential Space app, accessible by double-tapping the Essential Key.</p><p>Essenital Space is still in beta but its current form is very cool, albeit less useful than I initially hoped. In a nutshell, Essential Space is a digital replacement for a traditional DayMinder or daily planner book, helping you to easily create reminders and notes with the power of AI. While a lot of apps have tried to do this, Essential Space is built into the phone and works incredibly well.</p>

<p>Having a dedicated key to take notes or voice memos was game-changing for me. There were several times when I thought of something while driving, so I grabbed the phone, held the key down, and took a quick voice memo. Nothing's AI engine organized my thoughts while I was busy navigating the road and gave me a nice summary of those thoughts the next time I was able to look at my phone.</p><p>The idea is to eliminate the need to juggle multiple note-taking apps, and it has the potential to work very well. However, the feature is still fairly barebones for now. Organization is limited to making groups, and there's no way to search notes, but Nothing is bringing three major updates in the near future: Smart Search, Smart Collections, and Focus Search.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see how these all help Essential Space, but for now, this is a brilliant start to what I think will develop into something truly essential to the Nothing experience.</p>

<p>Camera quality was also surprisingly good and a notable step in quality above the Nothing Phone 2a. The Nothing Phone 2a's camera was notable for its price range last year but AI processing advancements over that time have changed the game. Thankfully, Nothing kept up.</p><p>All of the photos above show the stark contrast between generations, with many of Phone 2a's photos looking "cheap" while Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro look phenomenal. Zoom detail, in particular, is substantially better this time around, thanks to the new telephoto lenses.</p><p>Nothing Phone 3a Pro brings that one step further with a periscope 3X lens that further enhances zoom detail, particularly as you move beyond 10x zoom. Overall, these are great cameras and help build confidence in the brand and its capabilities.</p>

<p>Coming from Nothing Phone 2a, I'm disappointed in the gaming performance of the Nothing Phone 3a series. Nothing switched to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> for the Phone 3a series, and while it offers substantial improvements in multicore and AI processing performance, gaming performance is way down.</p><p>Benchmarks showed a 30-40% drop in FPS, and games I tested corroborated this change. Minecraft, for instance, runs between 40-50 FPS on average on the Nothing Phone 3a series, while it's 60-70 FPS on the Phone 2a. On the bright side, I never noticed the Phone 3a get even a little bit warm to the touch, even after running a series of benchmarks in a row on it.</p><p>I also didn't notice any performance issues during daily use, so unless you're a gamer, you may never notice this difference. In fact, the CPU and AI processing upgrade brought by this processor is probably best for most users.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Gaming performance is surprisingly weak compared to 2024's Nothing Phone 2a, and the large camera island on the Phone 3a Pro makes it a tough fit in some gaming controllers.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>On the design side, there's no doubt that some people aren't going to like the giant camera island on the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. This thing is seriously huge, and while it's at least uniform and centered, its size gets in the way pretty often.</p><p>It fits very awkwardly in my favorite gaming controller, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">GameSir G8 Galileo</a>, and has had me wondering more than once if I was going to bust the spring mechanism on the controller because of the awkward fit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UqXTJz36y26d2QsSD4y5M4" name="nothing-phone-3a-pro-mounted-in-gamesir-g8-galileo" alt="The large camera island on the Nothing Phone 3a Pro doesn't fit well in some gaming controllers like the GameSir G8 Galileo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UqXTJz36y26d2QsSD4y5M4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm also not a huge fan of the Essential Key's design. The shiny, convex shape protrudes from the body in a place that makes it <em>too </em>easy to press. More than once, I found myself clicking it or accidentally holding it when taking it out of my pocket.</p><p>This is OK for a single button press as you have to tap an additional save button — meaning you won't find accidental screenshots in the Essential Space. Voice recordings are all saved automatically, however, and it's not hard to figure out why this might become problematic quickly.</p><p>Lastly, the lack of proper U.S. availability is, once again, a huge disappointment. Nothing hasn't made a phone that works 100% with U.S. networks yet, which is the reason the phone can still only be purchased through the beta program. It worked fine on T-Mobile's 5G network here in North Carolina, but the company told me that AT&T and Verizon compatibility won't offer a good experience.</p>

<p>The Nothing Phone 3a's biggest competition is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x7-pro-review">Poco X7 Pro</a>. At around the same price, it offers better performance, a full IP68 water and dust resistance rating, faster charging, a larger battery, and an additional 512GB storage option. Poco's software isn't nearly as polished as Nothing's, though, and Nothing also offers two additional years of security updates beyond Poco's policy. The main reason to choose Nothing here would be the company's style, upgrade guarantee — something Nothing has been truly excellent about — and the clean software.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro's best competition is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-review">Honor 200 Pro,</a> which offers a 30% improvement in CPU performance and more than double the GPU performance.

If these two features are the most important for you, it's a no-brainer to pick Honor. Honor's software is also more feature-rich than Nothing, but it's often critiqued as looking too much like iOS. Choose Nothing if clean software, 6 years of updates, and overall style are most important to you.</p>

<p>Nothing is back with a brilliant pair of budget-minded phones, but it's not as big a win for the company this year as it was last year. Competitors like Poco and Honor have improved admirably in this space, and Nothing's choice of the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 means gaming performance, in particular, is much worse than last year's phone.</p><p>But there's something to be said about Nothing's style and impressive software. The company is second only to Google in its software update cadence, offering tons of new features for its phones every few months. I really like what Nothing OS has become in a few short years and love seeing it morph into something that looks and feels truly unique.</p><p>If I had to pick one reason to choose a Nothing Phone 3a or 3a Pro, it would be for its unique style. Plenty of phones look and feel similar these days, but Nothing differentiates itself in really fun ways. There's a level of inventiveness, creativity, and personality on Nothing's phones that only Google Pixel phones seem to offer, and even then, Google's "personality" really only comes through in the software. Nothing has the style factor down pat, and it's for that reason that Nothing Phones feel so darn cool to use.</p>

The two midrange smartphones are Nothing's first since it decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">prioritize building AI over its flagship Phone 3</a>, which is thought to be currently in the pipeline. In itself, that underscores an oddity with Nothing's launch — in a rare move, the company is releasing the budget Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro before their high-end counterpart.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a>, still available for $600 at the company's online store, was announced back in July 2023. Since then, the London-based tech startup has released four midrange phones: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a and Phone 2a Plus</a> in 2024, and now the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro in 2025. Anticipation is building for the standalone Phone 3, which is expected to be Nothing's first true flagship offering.</p><p>I've been using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro</a> for more than a week, and the experience has got me excited about what Phone 3 will bring. My main SIM has been in the Phone 3a Pro, distinguishable by its large, circular camera bump. So far, it's been hard to tell I've been using a mid-ranger. For reference, my last phone was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> — a bona-fide flagship — and yet it's been an easy transition.</p><p>The wait and pivot all-in on AI may have been worth it. The Nothing Phone 3a series includes two of my favorite AI features: Smart Drawer and Essential Space. It also has enough performance chops and camera quality for daily use, especially considering the phones' sub-$500 price point. Now that I've used Nothing's budget vision for the Phone 3 series, I know I want these five things in its flagship alternative.</p>
<h2 id="a-more-premium-build-with-metal-rails-2">A more premium build with metal rails </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="thF5h5ASmdqY7oGirPap4C" name="Nothing-Phone-2" alt="The Nothing Phone 2 with the Phone 3a and 3a Pro just out of the frame." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/thF5h5ASmdqY7oGirPap4C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing designed the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro with a striking build that's bound to be controversial. We've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-showcased-its-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-at-mwc-hours-before-launch">already seen the mixed response to the brand's teasers</a>, specifically regarding the camera bump. I tend to like the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro's design, but sometimes I can't tell whether the fun and quirky look is endearing — or just makes the handsets look like cheap toys.</p><p>There are two specific areas of concern: the matte, polycarbonate side rails, and the glossy Essential Key. Both the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro have flat, matte plastic side rails that make the devices feel a bit cheap. This kind of finish can feel premium, like ceramic, but it falls flat on the Phone 3a series. Meanwhile, I <em>really</em> don't like the glossy, reflective Essential Key. I find it sticks out like a sore thumb in the worst way.</p><p>The thing worth remembering about the Phone 3a series is that they <em>are</em> cheap, so these aspects are forgivable. On the flagship Phone 3, however, I'd like to see a return to aluminum side rails and a more appealing camera bump. The Phone 3a Pro's camera housing looks cool from head-on but is simply too thick, and the regular Phone 3 can't make the same mistake. It should take inspiration from the base Phone 3a, which has a slim and sleek camera module.</p>
<h2 id="a-redesigned-essential-space-key-2">A redesigned Essential Space Key</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gbkK4QPUUbdDNQ668yEbHA" name="Essential-Key-Stacked" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbkK4QPUUbdDNQ668yEbHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Essential Space is one of Nothing's key AI features available on the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro, and for good reason. To me, it's like a hybrid of Google Keep, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a>, and Pixel Recorder all-in-one. Nothing seems to have taken the best things about each of those apps, seamlessly integrating similar functionality into the Essential Space app in a way that just makes sense.</p><p>You can click the Essential Key to take a screenshot or screen recording, and/or add a voice memo or written note to it. Then, after processing, the Essential Space app will intelligently summarize or transcribe whatever has been recorded. It led to amazing situations where my Essential Space app recapped all the advanced metrics from my running workout, <em>and</em> created action items for what I should work on during my next run.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB" name="Essential-Space-Organized" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't say lightly that Essential Space may be my favorite smartphone AI feature yet. It's useful, and after building up habits and muscle memory, I could see this really coming in handy for people. So, what's bad about it? The Essential Key's implementation is a big miss, and Nothing should scrap it and go back to the drawing board for the flagship Phone 3.</p><p>There are two main problems with the Essential Key. First, it's located way too close to the power/lock button on the right side of both Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro. This makes accidental presses all too common.</p><p>More importantly, Nothing made the Essential Key protrude from the chassis, with a glossy finish and gemstone-like shape. The design is kind of obnoxious, in my opinion, and is a bad user interface choice. You want the <em>power button</em> to be easily discoverable by feel, not the Essential Key.</p><p>For the regular Phone 3, Nothing should look to Apple and OnePlus as examples of how to implement the Essential Key. It should be recessed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">like Apple's Camera Control</a>, or on the side of the phone with the volume rocker, like the Action button or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-oneplus-phone-future-alert-slider-replacement-rumors">OnePlus' Alert slider</a>. This would reduce accidental triggers for Essential Space, which can lead to annoying unwanted screenshots or recordings.</p>
<h2 id="a-truly-flagship-caliber-processor-2">A truly flagship-caliber processor</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qhyoqBPQiKK5J6NrsnGwQC" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-Pro-Phone-2-vs-3" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qhyoqBPQiKK5J6NrsnGwQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Expectedly, the Nothing Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro are powered by midrange processors. Both phones use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a>, which is more than powerful enough for daily use without hiccups but can actually disappoint in benchmarks. CPU performance is considerably improved, although our review found graphics performance was decreased significantly compared to the Phone 2a and Phone 2a Plus.</p><p>Nothing needs to shoot for the best of the best for the Phone 3's processor. The exact chip it should use depends on the price, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's groundbreaking Snapdragon 8 Elite processors</a> should absolutely be the goal. Nothing started Phone 2's pricing at $599 in the U.S., and the flagship Phone 3 will likely cost more than that.</p><p>If the Phone 3 costs nearly $800, the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is a must. That's especially true, considering AI is a key part of Nothing's strategy, and there's no better Android chip for AI processing.</p>
<h2 id="bigger-and-better-cameras-with-more-ai-2">Bigger and better cameras, with more AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="azQoE9GY3vMAdCWYX9D29D" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-Pro-Phone-2-vs" alt="The Nothing Phone 2, Phone 3a, and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/azQoE9GY3vMAdCWYX9D29D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the most part, I came away impressed with the Phone 3a Pro's camera system. It's using a 50MP main sensor from Samsung with an f/1.88 aperture and a 1/1.56-inch sensor size. That large lens is part of the reason why the Phone 3a Pro's camera bump is so big, but that is reflected in image quality. The Phone 3a Pro didn't do a great job adjusting exposure automatically on the fly, but it handled detail and motion excellently.</p><p>That main sensor is paired with a 50MP periscope telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and 6x in-sensor zoom with sensor crop. You also get an 8MP ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view. As you can see in the sample images below, the Phone 3a Pro does take decent images at various zoom levels.</p>

<p>For the Phone 3 to compete with flagships like the Galaxy S25, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, it'll need to take camera quality to the next level. Specifically, I'd like to see an even better periscope lens with 5x or greater true optical zoom. The ultrawide camera definitely could use improvement, as the 8MP sensor just isn't enough to keep up with the competition Phone 3 would face.</p><p>Nothing would be wise to add a few more AI camera features, like AI zoom enhancement and a reflection eraser. To be clear, the Phone 3a series offers great camera sensors for their respective price points, but I'm expecting Phone 3 to elevate the experience overall.</p>

<p>The last item on my wishlist is really a few quick hits: better haptic feedback, Qi2 support, and improved software. Starting with haptic feedback, it's quite aggressive on the Phone 3a series but doesn't feel nearly as smooth compared to the competition. While I find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-os-2-review">Nothing OS</a> to be an excellent Android skin — you can use it with a unique Nothing flavor or go for a more basic Pixel look — it could use a few more AI features to compete with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy and Google AI</a>.</p><p>The big one here is Qi2 support. No Android manufacturer is stepping up to the plate and adding magnets to their flagship phones. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">Consumers are left with a bunch of excuses</a>, and are being forced to buy cases for the full Qi2 experience. Nothing could really set itself apart by delivering the unabridged Qi2 standard on the Phone 3.</p>

<p>It's very rare that we see a tech company release their budget phones before their flagship ones, and that's why what Nothing is doing in 2025 is different. To be fair, it's not a bad strategy. Nothing is making a name for itself in the midrange category, securing emerging markets like India. For reference, the brand has sold over 7 million units of its products since its inception in 2020 and already surpassed $1 billion in total revenue — a tough feat for a smartphone startup in this decade.</p><p>Using the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro for more than a week only has me more excited for what Nothing's first flagship will look like. If it builds off what I love about these mid-rangers, the company's odd release schedule could turn out to be a hit.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro launched at this year's MWC, and comes with a significant boost to its camera systems.</li><li>The phones will come with a new action button that is said to trigger an AI-hub called 'Essential Space.'</li><li>Both devices will receive six years of essential updates, that will bring upgraded AI features on the phones.</li><li>The Phone 3a comes in three colorways: While, black, and Blue; While the Pro model shows up in grey or black colors.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing has finally unveiled its newest flagship devices at the MWC in Barcelona. The mid-range phones, Phone 3a and 3a Pro came after the company skipped the launching of its flagship last year as it wanted to focus on AI integration, which has finally arrived on these phones.</p><p>In terms of display, both the Phone 3a and 3a Pro have a 6.7 inch AMOLED LTPS flexible display protected by Panda Glass instead of Corning Gorilla Glass. Both these devices showcase a slightly thicker bezel size, of about 2.3mm. The displays have a refresh rate of 120Hz and 3,000 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>The phones are powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 and run the Nothing OS 3.1 out of the box which is built on the premise of Android 15. This combination is said to give the phones a much-needed boost, helping the devices perform complex AI tasks faster.</p><p>The overall design of both phones continues to have Nothing's signature exposed rear panel protected with a glass back.  The dimensions of both these devices slightly vary from each other. The standard 3a model weighs around 201 grams, while the 3a Pro weighs a bit heavier at 211 grams since this version has a slightly bigger screen. Both phones get an IP64 rating which protects the device from dust and water splashes.</p>

<p>Nothing says it has made advancements in camera systems on both the standard and the Pro models this year.</p><p>The Phone 3a showcases a pill-shaped horizontal camera setup with a 50MP main camera, another 50MP telephoto lens, and an 8MP ultrawide lens on the back, while the selfie camera sports a 32MP lens.</p><p>The Phone 3a Pro's circular triple camera array comes with a 50MP main camera, and 8MP ultrawide, and another 50MP periscope Sony LTY-600 sensor with 3x optical zoom.</p><p>This Pro version has an additional high-resolution 50MP sensor that allows the device to capture videos/images with a 60x ultra zoom, without compromising on the quality of these images—thanks to its AI clarity-enhancing algorithms. It also has an 8MP ultrawide lens and a 50MP front-facing camera.</p>

<p>Both mid-range devices come with a 5,000mAh battery that is said to last users for two days once charged fully, with a supported 50W fast charger, which the company claims will charge the device to 50% under 20 minutes.</p><p>Finally coming to the Phone 3a and 3a Pro's new action button on the side, that will bring up Essential Space—which is the new AI-powered hub that allows users to pen down their ideas with just a click of a button. The company adds, "Press the Essential Key to capture and send content to Essential Space, long-press to record a voice note, and double-tap to head straight to all your saved content."</p><p>Both phones will get 6 years of updates, including three years of Android updates and six years of security updates. These updates will bring new features to the AI-hub as well.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Nokia was the height of cool when I was a teen; the Finnish brand was at its zenith in the 2000s, and devices like the Nokia N95 and N73 delivered features you couldn't get anywhere else. While Nokia is no longer a thing, Human Mobile Devices (HMD) is trying to recreate some of that magic with its latest phone, the Fusion X1. <br><br>The Fusion X1 is the start of a new initiative at HMD dubbed the Better Phone Project, and it uses the Fusion — which debuted last year — as the foundation. The phone has a similar design and comes with magnetic pins at the back, allowing you to connect accessories with ease — HMD showcased a mobile gaming controller and ring light at the device's MWC 2025 launch. <br><br>It has a 108MP camera, and the overall design is intriguing, if not particularly distinctive. Where the Fusion X1 really stands out isn't the internals, but the software; HMD has teamed up with Xplora to build much-needed safeguards into the device. It allows parents to set up app approvals and controlled contacts, set screen time limits with better granularity than what's available today, and get live location updates. <br><br>All of it sounds sensible, and I'm glad that HMD is integrating these utilities out of the box. Social media addiction is a real problem for teens, and while most brands include token measures to restrict device usage, it isn't effective. HMD wants to change that dynamic. <br><br>What's in it for the teens? The device includes a 108MP camera at the back, and it has secure messaging and a rugged build quality. There's no mention of internals or the battery just yet, but seeing as how the Fusion X1 will be positioned in the budget segment, it should have decent enough hardware and at least a 5000mAh battery. <br>HMD plans to launch the Fusion X1 later this year, and I'll get my hands on the device closer to its debut to see if it does enough to convince teens to switch to Android.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Software updates on Android have come a long way, and most brands now guarantee at least four years of guaranteed platform updates — at least on their high-end phones. Google and Samsung, meanwhile, deliver seven years of Android updates, and Google extends the guarantee to the mid-range Pixel 8a.</p><p>Honor is now joining that elite club, with the manufacturer announcing at MWC 2025 that it will start rolling out seven Android OS updates to its Magic flagships. It's starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>, and will include Honor's foldable devices as well, but the Magic V3 isn't on that list as it debuted last year. <br><br>This is a big deal in and of itself, as Honor becomes the only Chinese manufacturer to deliver the long-term update guarantee. It gives the brand's devices a distinct advantage over its Chinese rivals, and alongside Honor's efforts around AI-focused utilities, MagicOS now has a unique differentiation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PErv6dQxcnGAjCKFrEdfUC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PErv6dQxcnGAjCKFrEdfUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor wants the move to "inspire industry peers to replicate" a similar guarantee on their own devices, but I don't see that anytime soon. OPPO is emphatic about four Android OS updates being enough on its phones, and Vivo isn't making any changes to its update schedule this year. Xiaomi, meanwhile, still continues to struggle with timely platform updates, and it just doesn't have the wherewithal to guarantee seven Android OS updates at this moment in time.  <br><br>Just like with Google and Samsung devices, Honor's phones will last considerably longer than their rivals, and even if you don't use the Magic 7 Pro for anywhere close to seven years, the long-term update guarantee means it will retain its resell value much better, and that's a great thing. <br><br>Another area where Honor is clearly looking to differentiate itself is AI; the brand outlined an overarching AI strategy at MWC 2025 wherein it is trying to build a connected ecosystem of devices that leverage AI. Look, I'm not particularly interested in AI and don't really use any generative AI services, but the way Honor puts it, the mobile agentic AI coming to its phones is designed to work as an assistant, allowing you to automate mundane tasks like booking a cab, a table at a restaurant, setting up calendar entries, meetings, and so on.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FgDVCyYbZzA2MJpoGx72XC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro search using AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgDVCyYbZzA2MJpoGx72XC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor is also building out utilities that make it seamless to transfer data to and from any device — even those not made by the brand — and it's aiming to create a collaborative platform of interconnected devices. <br><br>The idea is intriguing, but as with most things to do with AI, I'll withhold judgement until I'm actually able to use the features as advertised. That said, Honor has a decent suite of AI utilities on the Magic 7 Pro, and while most brands are shoehorning AI because it's the buzzword of the year, Honor has a clearly defined strategy around it, and the manufacturer is investing $10 billion over the next decade to building out this vision. <br><br>While I'm not keen on generative AI, I am absolutely in favor of an agentic model that can automate day-to-day tasks; that will be a big enough differentiator that if Honor actually manages to get it out the door before its rivals, it will be a sizable victory.</p>

It managed to create a unique design language thanks to a see-through aesthetic and clever use of LED lighting at the back, and it allowed phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a>, and soon-to-launch Phone 3a and 3a Pro to stand out amidst a sea of similar-looking devices. <br><br>Other brands are starting to take note of this, and rolling out their own iterations of the design. Infinix tried to emulate Nothing's distinctive design with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/infinix-gt-10-pro-review">GT 10 Pro</a>, and rugged device maker Doogee is now getting in on the action with the Blade GT Ultra at MWC 2025. <br><br>The Blade GT Ultra is touted to be the thinnest rugged phone around, but at 10.5mm and 260g, it is bulkier and considerably heavier the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, S25 Ultra, and just about any other regular phone. Doogee is clearly looking to create a similar aesthetic as Nothing's phones, and that's noticeable in the way the LED lighting is set up at the back of the phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fyhTrnWQzUKZkqNmLUexp8" name="Doogee Blade GT Ultra" alt="Doogee Blade GT Ultra at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fyhTrnWQzUKZkqNmLUexp8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get a ring LED light that encircles the middle portion at the back, and there are lighting zones next to the camera island and underneath it. The lighting is configurable, and it can be triggered to activate with incoming notifications or music playback. In addition to the lighting, Doogee is emulating the see-through design of Nothing phones with visible screws and exposed connectors. <br><br>I didn't get to use the Blade GT Ultra as it was behind a glass enclosure, but the Nothing-inspired design clearly allows the device to stand out against the rest of the rugged devices in Doogee's portfolio. The phone is powered by the Dimensity 7300 platform, and it has a 6.72-inch LCD panel with 120Hz refresh, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, and a 5500mAh battery with 18W charging. <br><br>It runs Android 14 out of the box with no mention of when Android 15 will become available, and it's evident that Doogee is positioning the rugged build quality and "unique" design as the differentiator. The phone is going on sale in select regions starting this month, and it costs $399.</p>

<hr>
<p>Finding Android apps with widget support used to be a hassle, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google's Play Store</a> is adding a new filter to make tracking down widget-friendly apps way easier.</p><p>Customizing your home screen with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-theming-widgets-android">widgets</a> that give you quick app updates has always been a big part of what makes Android stand out. But even Google agrees that developers have been stuck playing hide-and-seek when it comes to getting their widget-packed apps in front of users.</p><p>On top of making your home screen look cool, widgets have a practical role, too. A great widget can keep you hooked on an app by constantly serving up fresh updates right on your home screen, making sure it stays front and center in your daily routine.</p><p>So, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/03/google-play-enhances-widget-discovery.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that it is making it easier to find apps with widgets by adding a ‘Widgets’ filter to Play Store search. It helps users quickly spot apps with widget support (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/03/android-widgets-play-store/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>At the same time, app listings will now include a clear visual badge for widget support, so users won’t have to dig through text or images to find out. This tweak could also boost downloads, making it easier for people to pick apps that offer the features they want.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Google Play Store is launching a special hub to spotlight apps with widgets, sorted by categories like productivity and entertainment. This space will not only show off what widgets can do but also put the spotlight on apps that nail widget design. For developers who put effort into building great widgets, it’s a chance to get noticed and hopefully rack up more downloads.</p><p>These updates are rolling out to the Google Play Store on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, tablets, and foldables. But if you’re using the Play Store website on a desktop or laptop, you’re out of luck because these changes won’t apply there. That’s probably going to rub some users the wrong way, especially those who prefer browsing for apps on bigger screens.</p>

<p>The Spark Slim has a thickness of just 5.75mm, making it considerably thinner than Samsung's upcoming ultra-thin phone. But where it truly stands out is the battery; Tecno somehow managed to slot in a sizable 5200mAh battery into the phone, and that's just wild.</p>

<p>I managed to get my hands on the device on the MWC show floor, and the sleek profile is a definite differentiator; it makes all other devices look bloated — particularly the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> that I used to take these photos.</p>

<p>The distinctive design feature is the camera island at the back, and the wide camera bar evokes memories of Motorola's Droid devices of yesteryear. I really like the design of the camera housing, and while it protrudes slightly from the chassis, it isn't all that noticeable. There's an LED light ring around each module, and a horizontal bar that runs along the width of the camera housing, and it's just plain cool.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Tboj3yCTTAjchQrY9jFT4" name="Tecno Spark Slim" alt="Tecno Spark Slim hands-on at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Tboj3yCTTAjchQrY9jFT4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike most phones today, the Spark Slim has dual-curved edges on either side of the screen, and it has a curved sides where the back meets the mid-frame. This allowed Tecno to reduce the thickness even more, and while there isn't much to hold on to at the sides — it measures 5.75mm, after all — it wasn't uncomfortable to hold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Au7Gqm6xd922CdkMZJmNT4" name="Tecno Spark Slim" alt="Tecno Spark Slim hands-on at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Au7Gqm6xd922CdkMZJmNT4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If anything, the plastic back and curved design assist in usability, and while I used plenty of ultra-thin phones in the past, the Spark Slim is notable because of its sheer battery size. It has a definite advantage over the Galaxy S25 Edge in that regard, and again, it's somehow thinner than Samsung's device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tzoYLRFWT2akUFgkgTdGT4" name="Tecno Spark Slim" alt="Tecno Spark Slim hands-on at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tzoYLRFWT2akUFgkgTdGT4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Spark Slim has a 6.78-inch AMOLED that goes up to 144Hz, and there are two 50MP cameras at the back and a 13MP camera located up front. Tecno didn't reveal the internals, only stating that it is powered by an octa-core platform. The interface felt fluid in the 10 minutes I used the device, but then again, it was a demo unit and didn't have anything installed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NFjkHbzKWKTzGFiR5STiS4" name="Tecno Spark Slim" alt="Tecno Spark Slim hands-on at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NFjkHbzKWKTzGFiR5STiS4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this point, there's no mention of when (or if) the Spark Slim will make its debut. While it is a remarkable technical showcase, it isn't clear at this point if Tecno will put the device into production, or if it can do so at scale while still retaining the ultra-thin design and the 5200mAh battery. Still, the Spark Slim is proof that it is possible to create a sleek phone with a huge battery, and I want Tecno to launch this device at some point — we need better alternatives to the Galaxy S25 Edge.</p>

<p>At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mwc-2025-what-to-expect">MWC 2025</a>, TCL <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tcl-introduces-six-new-models-in-the-tcl-60-series-enhancing-connectivity-and-user-engagement-by-diversifying-portfolio-302389814.html" target="_blank">unveiled</a> its expanded 60 series lineup and shared its plan to bring advanced AI features to budget-friendly phones worldwide.</p><p>TCL stands out by making tech more accessible instead of chasing the high-end market. TCL differentiates itself from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">premium brands</a> by offering phones with flagship-like features at a price point of around $200. That also means bringing AI to its devices requires a fresh, straightforward approach.</p><p>Instead of packing pricey AI chips into every phone, TCL is going all-in on the cloud. This lets the company roll out AI features no matter what hardware a user has.</p><p>The TCL 60 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-5g-launch">made its debut at CES 2025 in January</a>, kicking off with the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER 5G, a $200 phone set to hit the U.S. market later this year. But that’s just the start. TCL plans to expand the lineup with a mix of NXTPAPER-equipped devices and standard displays, rolling them out across Asia, Europe, and Latin America to cover all the bases.</p><p>TCL's NXTPAPER tech mimics the feel of real paper, making screens easier on the eyes. The 2025 lineup debuts NXTPAPER 4.0, which cuts down on glare, filters blue light, and delivers spot-on colors to ease eye strain and make every glance at the screen a little nicer.</p>

<p>Leading the pack is the TCL 60 NXTPAPER, featuring TCL’s signature eye-friendly display for around €200, but you’ll only find it in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Next up, the TCL 60 SE NXTPAPER 5G brings 5G support at a slightly lower €190 and expands availability to Europe.</p><p>If you just want 5G without the NXTPAPER perks, the TCL 60 5G lands at €170 and is rolling out in Europe and Asia-Pacific. The TCL 60 SE, also priced at €170, gets an even wider release, hitting the Middle East and Africa too.</p><p>For budget-conscious buyers, the TCL 60R 5G is priced at just €120 and widely available. And finally, the most affordable of the bunch, the TCL 605, comes in at €110, launching in the same regions as the 60 SE.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The last few years have been quite tumultuous for those of us who enjoy game emulating on Android. Last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">Nintendo went after</a> the two biggest players in Switch emulation, with the original creators of Ryujinx and Yuzu being forced to halt development. However, after the waters calmed a bit, development has picked up a bit, albeit at a slower pace.</p><p>On the flip side, we have Sony, a company that seems perfectly content with emulator development for its consoles. In fact, the problems surrounding the emulation of Sony consoles have stemmed from developers and the community. For instance, in early 2023, the development of AetherSX2 was "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/arm-based-ps2-emulator-aethersx2-suspends-development-indefinitely.624227/">suspended indefinitely</a>" after the developer stated they'd experienced "neverending impersonating, complaints, demands, and now death threats."</p><p>So while Switch emulator development has started to ramp back up a bit, the same couldn't be said about Sony's consoles. For quite some time, there was hope in the community that RPCS3 would release its PS3 emulator on Android.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="D3hrUttrUvqWfmmZYTiMRh" name="rpcs3-arm64-announcement-banner" alt="RPCS3 for arm64 devices announcement banner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D3hrUttrUvqWfmmZYTiMRh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: RPCS3)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, those hopes were dashed in December 2024, when RPCS3 for arm64 was released. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rpcs3.net/blog/2024/12/09/introducing-rpcs3-for-arm64/">announcement blog post</a>, there's an entire section dedicated to "other mobile platforms." Specifically in regards to Android, the blog post says "We have no intention of porting RPCS3 to these platforms at this time." And as for the reason? "We are aware it comes with its own disadvantages, such as having to deal with toxic users that have harassed other emulator developers in the past, like the brilliant developers behind AetherSX2."</p><p>So yeah, RPCS3 pulled no punches and went with a "we can't have nice things because of you" approach.</p><p>At the time, there would be rumblings of someone managing to get a PS3 emulator running on Android. Occasionally, the news would spread like wildfire, only for the original post to be deleted from Reddit, or for someone else to point out that it's just video playback. That is, until fairly recently.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pLLvTj3AGEqTGqzhNkLdbR" name="ps3-on-android-5" alt="Different PS3 emulators on the AYANEO Pocket EVO" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pLLvTj3AGEqTGqzhNkLdbR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, and yet again, news of a PS3 emulator on Android spread like wildfire. The emulator, known as aPS3e, was readily available for download; many emulation enthusiasts clicked and sideloaded everything as fast as they could. People began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/search/?q=aps3e&cId=">posting their results (and issues) on Reddit</a>, and it wasn't long before a familiar face joined the fray.</p><p>Jarrod Norwell, the developer of one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/emuplace/sudachi.emuplace.app">surviving Switch emulators</a>, in addition to a multi-system emulator on iOS, discovered that aPS3e wasn't what it claimed to be. Instead of aPS3e running the same way that other Android apps do, it was essentially RPCS3 running via Termux, a Linux terminal and environment emulator for Android.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Poor mans RE but aPS3e uses Termux, those GitHub issues are getting much worse pic.twitter.com/ySEuMlcAqw<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1891570442395136322">February 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Adding fuel to the fire, it turned out that aPS3e was using code from both Vita3K and RPCS3, which would normally be fine. However, the developer released the app under the GPLv2 license, didn't provide the entire source code, and when asked to do so, said it would do so after users paid $5,000, before reducing the demand to $2,000.</p><p>One member of the RPCS3 team <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250217171428/https://github.com/aenu/aps3e/issues/1">raised an issue</a> on the aPS3e GitHub, making "a formal request for you to comply with the GPLv2 license." After ignoring the complaints for a few hours, aPS3e and the developer's GitHub account were completely removed — only for it to reappear on a completely different website, while both a subreddit and Discord channel were created.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:923px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="kgjzoYwD3TrB7tCbRs8qvX" name="rpcs3-license-violation-issue-aps3e-github" alt="GPLv2 License Violation Issue from RPCS3 Developer on aPS3e GitHub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kgjzoYwD3TrB7tCbRs8qvX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="923" height="519" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: GitHub via Archive.org)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Circling back to Norwell, shortly after they shared their findings, a new GitHub repo appeared on Norwell's account. The aptly named "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/jarrodnorwell/rpcs3droid">rpcs3droid</a>" is described as an "attempt at running RPCS3 on Android natively via Android Studio." Due to the open-source nature of RPCS3, Norwell is relying on the base code to get started. However, Norwell shared that this will be more of a side-project than anything else.</p><p>While this was not the conclusion that we would've hoped for, another new PS3 emulator GitHub repo was discovered from an unlikely source that offered new hope. The project is named "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/DHrpcs3/rpcs3-android">RPCS3-Android</a>," and comes from a developer simply known as "DH."</p><p>Why does this matter? Well, DH was one of the original developers for RPCS3, before leaving to begin work on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/RPCSX/rpcsx">RPCSX</a>, a PS4 emulator. Now, it seems that DH wants to see if they can get RPCS3 working on Android.</p><p>The RPCS3-Android sat dormant for a few days, until a flurry of pull requests and updates resulted in the first RPCS3 for Android Alpha build.</p><p>Before you get too excited, you won't actually be able to get any games to load. Instead, this build is more about laying the foundation and ensuring that the app is even able to run.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="q9CNzMjcBt4AktGg2WqhbR" name="ps3-on-android-1" alt="Rayman on Pocket EVO with aPS3e on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q9CNzMjcBt4AktGg2WqhbR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the time that all of this was happening, various comments and posts were being made by the developer of aPS3e. Before removing the project from GitHub, aPS3e v0.5 was released, giving everyone the opportunity to tinker around with something new and shiny. There's also a newer v0.7 build floating around, but it's not readily available.</p><p>That being said, over on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aenu.cc/aps3e/">developer's website</a>, you'll see a statement that says "aPS3e will enter a closed testing phase." In order to participate, you'll have to sign up through either Reddit or Discord; however, there aren't actually any clear links to join the beta test, so we assume you'll just have to message one of the mods.</p>
<hr>
<p>I wish I could say that we're on the brink of something incredible, and maybe we are. However, in its current iteration, aPS3e is not the "savior" of PS3 emulation on Android that we hoped for. It's still essentially the Linux build of RPCS3 wrapped in Termux and isn't running natively.</p><p>That's not to say all hope is lost, as the saga has piqued the interest of at least two prominent developers in the Android space. All we can do now is wait, and hope that bad apples in the community don't end up spoiling the fun for everyone else. Let the developers try and work their magic, and hopefully, this will quickly be forgotten. Patience is key.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung has filed a new patent that shows the Ring-like device to be taking temperatures of objects and people.</li><li>It could come with visual, auditory, or tactile alerts that show up on the ring.</li><li>The new ring may also sport new motion sensors that go with these temperature sensors.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring </a>launched in July last year after which, the company rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">new sizes</a> for the wearable ahead of its recent Unpacked event. And now, it looks like they're working on the next Gen of the wearable.</p><p>We've heard little to nothing of the Galaxy Ring 2, luckily a new patent filed by the company hints at an interesting feature it could bring. The upcoming Ring could come with new sensors, that measure not just the surface but also the body temperatures of the user as well as others (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-patents-ring-temperature-sensor-on-demand/" target="_blank">via 91Mobiles</a>).  These sensors are said to be placed on the side that comes in contact with the user's skin, just like the ones on the first Galaxy Ring.</p><p>The publication further adds that the new ring will also sport motion sensors such as an accelerometer and gyroscope. This will gauge the user's finger and hand moments that will determine "where it is as well as how it's being used." The wearable will allegedly come built-in with the tech that will recognize the movement patterns of the user, which will trigger the temperature sensor to be activated.</p><p>For instance, if your hand moves a certain way to check the temperature of a drink, versus a person's body temperature— it can differentiate between the two. According to the patent, this could be possible if the ring had one non-contact temperature sensor and one contact temperature sensor.   As shown in the sketches below.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025037761">patent adds </a>that the final temperature readings <em>may</em> show up on the Ring, in the form of visual, auditory, or tactile alerts. The same goes for any other notifications the ring needs to send out to the user. This means that the surface of the upcoming Galaxy Ring could have a display, speaker, and haptic motor— a first for a wearable of this size.</p><p>In a separate<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-patent-future-galaxy-ring-control-devices/"> patent filed</a> in February, the new ring is shown to control other devices, working as a cursor, moving things around on what looks like a laptop or a tablet's screen.  Just like the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/doublepoint-wowmouse-app-ces-2024"> WowMouse app</a> that turns your WearOs smartwatch into a mouse, with air gestures, that was spotted at CES 2024.</p><p>It is important to note that not all patent requests make it to the final device. While it would be nice to see this show up on the Galaxy Ring 2, here is<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2"> what we expect to see </a>on the next-gen ring.</p>

<ul><li>The upcoming Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus renders reveal a notable display, single camera visor, and flat-edge design.</li><li>It is tipped to carry an aluminum build and weigh significantly less yet look big enough.</li><li>The tablet is further expected to ship with Android 15-based One UI 7 out of the box.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Last month, we learned about some of the rumored specs for Samsung’s upcoming tablet. The latest leak, however, displays the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus in full via renders.</p><p>The renders were shared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/exclusive-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-plus-renders-leak/?utm_source=twitter">SammyGuru</a> by prominent leaker OnLeaks, and are believed to be CAD renders of the upcoming Android tablet — revealing the Fan Edition device’s design and dimensions.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive: First Look at Galaxy Tab S10 FE+ in 360 Video and 5K Renders #samsung #galaxy #tipsandtricks #news #android #tabs10fe #tabs10feplus #onleaks https://t.co/yfK2AtiFmK<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1895858886575317013">March 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Like the flagship counterparts, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-is-here-but-one-major-thing-is-missing">Galaxy Tab S10 Plus</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>, the Fan Edition tablet also carries a similar design; however, there appears to be only a single camera at the back instead of two as witnessed in last year’s models.</p><p>Per the renders, the tablet carries a slimmer form factor and a taller display with symmetrical bezels. It also features rounded corners next to flat sides like the Tab S10 Plus. It will likely carry an aluminum build, which should make the tablet lighter in hand. The leak further indicates that it would carry 300.5mm x 194.7mm x 6mm dimensions — making it a significantly slimmer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>.</p>

<p>The other expected specifications of the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus include a 13.1-inch IPS LCD display — a notable increase over the previous iteration, the Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10-fe-plus-leak-drops-and-suddenly-the-previous-model-looks-tiny">Previous leaks</a> have indicated that there is also a regular Galaxy Tab S10 FE alongside the Plus model. Both models are expected to be powered by an Exynos 1580 chipset — an in-house developed mid-range processor. The models are also tipped to carry at least 12GB of RAM paired with 256GB of onboard storage. The Plus model is also rumored to support the S-Pen, feature a 12MP selfie camera, and ship with One UI 7 out of the box.</p><p>The launch timeframe of the upcoming Galaxy Tab S10 Plus FE tablet is yet to be determined. Going by the previous iteration’s launch, we should be seeing the Android tablet somewhere in October.</p>

<p>Nothing has been left to the imagination (pun intended) when it comes to Nothing's upcoming flagship devices. The company has been dropping more than<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-essential-key-ai-suite-leaked"> just teasers </a>all of last week and, now, at the MWC it 'live-teased' both the Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro in all its glory. (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/03/nothing-phone-3a-and-phone-3a-pro-in-the-flesh/#more-663791">via 9to5Google</a>)</p><p>These phones are set to launch tomorrow (March 4) and according to Android Central's Managing Editor, Derrek Lee, Nothing showed off these devices at Qualcomm's booth at the MWC. Considering these phones are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nothing_phone_(3a)_pro-13649.php">rumored</a> to sport the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset.</p><p>The images by the publication indicate that the phone's leaks up to this point seem to be headed in the right direction when it comes to the overall look of the device. The Phone 3a Pro is showcased in a grey colorway,  sporting a huge circular camera bump and curved Glyph lighting LEDs around it. This phone is said to come with three cameras on the rear, as seen in the image— two of which are rumored to be 50MP, sporting a new periscope lens.</p><p>The Phone 3a is seen in an all-white colorway with its Pixel-like horizontal camera array, with a tiny red square within the rear panel, similar to the one that was teased by the company on X a few days ago.</p>

<p>The images also that the device is said to come with three buttons— on the Nothing Phone 3a, the volume and power control buttons are both seen in black, and the rumored action button device is also black, 9to5Google added. This button is said to launch more than just the camera, and from the looks of it, this button is customizable. In a recent video, the company showed off that this button could trigger something called 'Essential spaces' calling it the user's second memory. Users can snap photos, capture voice notes, and more through various key pressing functions and the AI will "sort" and "categorize" them for you.</p><p>That said, the Phone 3a series' Glyph lighting is supposedly customizable, however it was not showcased at the MWC. The wait isn't for much long as these phones will be out for the world to see and experience tomorrow.</p>

<ul><li>Google pushed two major updates to Gemini on iPhone, with the first concerning a slight app home screen redesign.</li><li>The writing field changes as Google makes it cleaner and more streamlined while iPhone lock screens grab a host of Gemini-based widgets for easy access.</li><li>Gemini on iPhone launched in November with Imagen 3 capabilities for "photorealistic" image creation and much more AI intelligence.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google was spotted rolling out two separate updates for its Gemini users on iPhone, bringing new features and a slight redesign.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/24/gemini-iphone-redesign/">9to5Google</a> highlighted one of the updates, version 1.2025.0670001, as one that brings a small Gemini on iPhone app rework. Opening the app remains the same; however, Google has redesigned the chat bar at the bottom. Before, the bar was quite cluttered (and short) as it placed its microphone and an image option within the writing field.</p><p>This latest update extends the writing field across the length of your display horizontally. Google has left its microphone icon off to the right and dropped the image option inside the plus icon's sub-menu. Now, opening the menu shows Camera, Gallery, and Files choices.</p><p>The App Store's changelog states the update also brings "improved sources and related content display, more tailored responses about places on Google Maps, and UI improvements and bug fixes." Additionally, Google has brought the ability for Gemini Advanced users to "reference past chats" with the AI for "tailored help."</p><p>On the other hand, version 1.2025.0762303 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/03/gemini-iphone-lockscreen-widgets/#more-663801">brings an update</a> to Gemini's help on the iPhone's lock screen. The main highlight of these widgets, as noted by 9to5, is iPhone users can now "launch Gemini immediately" through any of the widgets. Specifically, the update adds six tools: Type Prompt, Talk Live, Open Mic, Use Camera, Share Image, Share File.</p><p>The app's changelog explains users can now share text, images, and links with Gemini "from any app."</p>

<p>Regarding the initial redesign patch notes, Google's highlight of "referencing past chats" sounds like its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-saved-info-rollout-detailed">Gemini Advanced update</a> from November. A few months ago, the company let its Gemini Advanced users tell the AI to "Remember," "Keep in mind," or "Always provide" for a more tailored experience. In short, users could tell the AI to remember important details about them like preferences, hobbies, or what they do for work.</p><p>The goal was to deliver a more "tailored experience," which is what Google recently reiterated for its iPhone users.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-on-iphone-dedicated-app-launch">Gemini on iPhone</a> launched a few days before that Advanced update, bringing Imagen 3's prowess and app extensions. The Imagen 3 model brought the ability for users to create high-quality, "stunning" imagery through their prompts to the AI. The company states users can create "photorealistic" images of animals, plants, and more. Elsewhere, Gemini could be used on iPhones to help students with studying or with hteir homework.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung started informing its Members app users that it will drop support for Android 7 devices.</li><li>Users with an Android 7 device will need to update to Android 8 or higher in order to retain Members app access.</li><li>Elsewhere, Samsung is still chugging along its One UI 7 development cycle as a recent Beta 5 patch arrived after yet another delay.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is beginning to inform its Galaxy users that it's ending support for a nearly ten-year-old piece of software.</p><p>Users on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1j04iuo/samsung_drops_support_for_android_7_update_or/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">One UI subreddit</a> reported Samsung's recent Members app announcement about Android OS support (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-is-pulling-the-plug-on-members-app-for-android-7-users/">SammyGuru</a>). In an app pop-up, Samsung states that it "strives to provide a better service experience;" however, it will cut off support for Galaxy devices with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nougat">Android 7</a> on April 1. As the publication notes, Android 7, codename: Nougat, is nine years old, so perhaps this isn't surprising.</p><p>Nevertheless, the post encourages users to update their device to "Android 8 or higher," lest they suffer the loss of Samsung Members app access.</p><p>This creates an interesting narrative because, as Samsung notes, some devices may be unable to upgrade/update OS versions. Users can check on their own first by heading into <strong>Settings > Software Update > Download and Install</strong>. In the event you have questions about your device's OS eligibility, Samsung recommends users contact its support (Customer Center).</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1j04iuo/samsung_drops_support_for_android_7_update_or">Samsung drops support for Android 7: update or lose access after April 2025</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui">r/oneui</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>This is quite an old OS and it's a surprise Samsung kept its support rolling for its Members app for this long, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1j04iuo/comment/mf8agxn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">as one user notes</a>. Moreover, another post highlights Android 7's lack of proper update support for a "long while." The software has been out of commission since the second half of 2019. Users with an older device still rocking Android 7 should see if they can upgrade their device properly, and, if not, seeking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the latest product</a> might be another option.</p><p>While Samsung cleans up its Members app OS support, a more pressing matter concerns its major Android OS launch: One UI 7 — which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">got delayed again</a>. Testers reported an issue with its "Natural" mode screen optimization option. The mode made displays much yellower than intended. Samsung reportedly had to take its OS back into the kitchen to fix it.</p><p>What resulted was yet another test, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-releases-yet-another-one-ui-7-beta-update-for-the-galaxy-s24">One UI 7 Beta 5</a>, to continue to solve issues within the software. Several bug fixes and a solution for a Visual Voicemail crash were among the patch notes in mid-February.</p><p>We've crossed into March, meaning Samsung's days are numbered to hit its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">recently stated Q1 2025 release</a> for One UI 7. The company stated in a blog post that the OS would arrive "imminently" on Galaxy devices. Samsung products with upgrade "eligibility" are set to receive it (hopefully) this month. Other "existing" Galaxy devices will have to wait a little longer.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung has come all geared up at MWC this year and has already shared what it has to offer, including the latest Galaxy phones and its AI innovations. The company makes some great displays, and the Barcelona event is a perfect stage to showcase the same.</p><p>The company has announced it is unveiling the OLED Magic concept at MWC, wherein attendees can experience the high-end qualities that Samsung makes, catering to various devices like smartphones, tablets, laptops, and TVs. All can be witnessed under the Seamless Color Studio at the event.</p><p>The highlight from the studio appears to be “On-Cell Film (OCF) technology,” which is believed to be a cutting-edge advancement in premium display technology.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.50%;"><img id="bKvDXKNxoX58r5nwqHB7Bm" name="samsung-display-mwc-2025-oled" alt="Samsung display booth MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bKvDXKNxoX58r5nwqHB7Bm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="916" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The studio includes a demonstration of multiple screen experiences, which includes a 31.5-inch monitor, a 16-inch laptop, and a 6.7-inch phone — all of which feature a “seamless color consistency,” highlighting Samsung Display’s expertise.</p><p>It is further displaying a new OLED Tile, a full-screen technology that features an ultra-thin bezel — as thin as 0.6mm. It is to create a near-bezel-less design as the demo includes ten of 6.8-inch bezel-less panels and two larger monitors.</p><p>Samsung notes that this innovation will be 40% thinner than the average bezel width found in the current market. The aim is to enhance the overall experience when incorporated into Samsung’s upcoming devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:889px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.49%;"><img id="totZjiR7HcgmkDW5t8RpAm" name="samsung-display-mwc-2025-oled-ocf" alt="Samsung display booth MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/totZjiR7HcgmkDW5t8RpAm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="889" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OCF is said to be a low-power consumption technology, which will eliminate “the need for a polarizer by integrating its function directly into the pixel, significantly reducing exterior reflections. As a result, OCF offers about 1.5 times the brightness while maintaining the same power consumption.”</p><p>It further makes the display carry a thinner design than the standard OLED panels available today. The company also notes that OCF falls under the Low power, Eco-friendly, Augmented brightness, and Designed to be Thin and Slim ( aka L.E.A.D) initiative. It also aims to showcase high performance in extreme light environments like having 5000 nits of peak brightness, which can be applied to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">smartphones</a> in the near future.</p><p>Samsung Display further explains that “this level of brightness is achieved when the on-pixel ratio (OPR) — which measures the percentage of active pixels on the screen — is at 10%.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.50%;"><img id="bKvDXKNxoX58r5nwqHB7Bm" name="samsung-display-mwc-2025-oled" alt="Samsung display booth MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bKvDXKNxoX58r5nwqHB7Bm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="916" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the OCF tech, the MWC booth is also showcasing 77-inch and 65-inch QD-OLED TVs next to a 31-inch QD-OLED monitor, which tends to offer color quality matching “real-life vibrancy.”</p><p>Other display innovations like Flexible Cabinbag, which is an 18.1-inch foldable screen, and a Polygon Foldable are also showcased at the studio. The latter offers a 3.38-inch diamond-shaped OLED display, which is likely to make its way onto the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> — particularly on the clamshell phones — explicitly for the exterior display.</p><p>Samsung Display also shared some line-ups, which are built for gaming experiences. It includes the world’s first 27-inch 500Hz QD-OLED monitor alongside 160 PPI high-resolution 27-inch QD-OLED and 240 Hz OLED laptops.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.50%;"><img id="9WF5oXjvBy2kieuGNzNWAm" name="samsung-display-mwc-2025-flex-gaming" alt="Samsung display booth MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9WF5oXjvBy2kieuGNzNWAm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="916" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last but not least, Samsung has unveiled a new gaming console dubbed Flex Gaming, which is also put on display at the MWC event. It happens to be a concept that features a 7.2-inch OLED along with Steam Deck and Razer Blade 16 — both further equipped with Samsung OLED tech. At the booth, users can experience Krafton’s InZOI simulation being demonstrated to experience what Flex Gaming has to offer.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-92">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Watch 5 Ultra boasts a titanium build with a mix of matte and polished finishes, paired with a 22mm strap in black fluoroelastomer or dark brown leather.</li><li>It sports a 1.5-inch LTPO AMOLED with a 60Hz refresh rate and up to 15 days of battery life.</li><li>The watch runs on Honor’s MagicOS, but works with both Android and iOS.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor has unveiled the Watch 5 Ultra, its latest shot at taking on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">top Android smartwatches</a> and a premium upgrade to the Watch series.</p><p>The company's latest smartwatch is a key piece of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">bigger AI push</a>, which Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/honor-unveils-the-stunning-honor-watch-5-ultra-at-mwc-2025-302389452.html" target="_blank">flaunted at MWC 2025</a>. It’s not just about the watch—Honor is rolling out a whole lineup of devices, like the AI-boosted Honor MagicBook Pro 14, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-pad-v9-review">Honor Pad V9</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/honor-earbuds-open-review">Honor Earbuds Open</a>.</p><p>Honor also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-unveils-commitment-to-7-years-of-os-and-security-updates-for-the-magic-series">promises seven years of Android updates</a> for its smartphones.</p><p>The Honor Watch 5 Ultra stands out with its bold design. The titanium build blends a rounded display with sharp edges, mixing matte and polished finishes for a sleek look.</p><p>Inside its bold frame, the Honor Watch 5 Ultra packs a 1.5-inch AMOLED display with LTPO tech and a 60Hz refresh rate. The always-on display and adaptive refresh rates help save power, and Honor claims its 480mAh battery can last up to 15 days on a full charge.</p><p>You’ve got a simple two-button setup here—a customizable shortcut key and a handy rotary crown for easy navigation. It's also packed with all the health sensors you’d expect and even supports wireless charging.</p><p>Right out of the gate, this watch brings handy features to the table. There’s the Quick Health Scan, which gives you a fast, detailed check on how your body’s doing. Plus, it rolls out a Healthy Morning Report to give you a snapshot of your energy and readiness for the day.</p><p>One big caveat is that it doesn’t run on Wear OS. Instead, the Honor Watch Ultra 5 uses Honor’s own MagicOS. While that might be a dealbreaker for some, it still works smoothly with both Android and iOS.</p><p>Honor has priced the Watch 5 Ultra at €279, as revealed during its Barcelona keynote. It comes with a 22mm strap, available in black fluoroelastomer or dark brown leather.</p>

For a limited time, the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCX11JT6" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE has crashed 38% at Amazon</strong></a> to its lowest point ever. The so-called "Fan Edition" tablet is normally priced at $450, so getting it for just under $280 is a stellar opportunity.</p><p>The S9 FE is our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablet for students</a>, featuring a 10.9-inch LCD screen, the S Pen stylus, and compatibility with a useful keyboard case that makes it easy to use like a laptop. This configuration has 128GB of storage, and Samsung says it has up to 18 hours of battery life per charge, which is perhaps one benefit of not having an AMOLED display. Other nice features include the S Pen, the microSD port, cross-device multitasking, and IP68 dust and water resistance, among others still.</p>

This tablet is a great pick for students, professionals, or pretty much anyone looking for a solid mid-range Galaxy tablet. It also comes with Samsung's S Pen and up to 18 hours of battery life, which users love. This particular deal is for the gray tablet with 128GB of storage, though you can also upgrade with these and a few other options.</p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S9-FE-10-9-Tablet-128GB-Android-Tablets-Gray/5022271252" target="_blank">Walmart - $278.02</a> | <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-10-9-128gb-wi-fi-with-s-pen-gray/6557719.p?skuId=6557719" target="_blank">Best Buy - $299.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCX11JT6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7d3f56b1-2541-442b-bb94-e8a32aac1f79" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE:" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a tablet that includes the first-party S Pen; you're looking for something that balances affordability with utility; you have or have had other devices in the Galaxy ecosystem and have like them.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you specifically want a tablet with an AMOLED display; you're looking for a tablet with industry-leading performance and have a budget to go premium.</p><p>We think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-launch">Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE</a> is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets#section-best-for-students">best Samsung tablet for students</a>, largely due to its affordability, usefulness with other Galaxy devices, the inclusion of the S Pen, and its nearly-18-hour battery life. While it includes an LCD display instead of an AMOLED screen, most users find it bright enough and still vibrant, along with being large enough for a wide range of tasks.</p><p>While this deal is for the 128GB storage version of the S9 FE, the microSD port offers expandable storage of up to 1TB. We also love the Samsung keyboard case for this tablet, though users will have to buy it separately.</p><p>It's worth noting that the Exynos chipset in this tablet does leave a little bit to be desired in the performance department, but at under $300, it's definitely competitive compared to other tablets around this price.</p>

<p>The yearly tech meet i.e., the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mwc-2025-what-to-expect">Mobile World Congress(MWC) </a>is underway in Barcelona, and while we're seeing several tech companies show off their latest innovations—Google didn't want to miss out on the fun.</p><p>It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/android-gemini-mobile-world-congress-2025/">announced</a> today, that its multimodal Gemini-powered—Project Astra will also be shown off at the MWC, as a part of how AI on Android devices can help simplify life for its users. In an attempt to do so, the company is said to allow people attending the MWC to test out the new version of Gemini Live firsthand.</p><p>"You can learn how Gemini Live can help you with complex topics (in multiple languages!), use Circle to Search to translate a menu, and check how the latest partner devices from Android are bringing these experiences to life," the press release stated.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bLHY4Op9Y0U" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra</a> was first shown off at Google I/O last year, where a woman is seen interacting with her surroundings through her phone, asking the assistant about various objects placed on a table or even creating iterations about a golden retriever. It was fascinating to see how Gemini-Live has pushed the boundaries of the mere Google Search beyond just looking for something online. Now anyone could simply use "Circle to Search" on their devices to look up something they spotted within a different app.</p><p>With Project Astra, Google wants to make 'finding' things easier not just on your phone, but out in the world as well. There have also been some rumors recently on how Gemini will be replacing Google Assistant in the future. A deep dive into the latest beta version of the Google app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/looks-like-a-new-wake-word-could-be-replacing-hey-google">revealed</a> that "Hey Google" could be replaced with "Hey Gemini."</p><p>Now, with Google showing off Gemini's live video and screen sharing, this change could be coming sooner than we anticipated. The company stated that it will start rolling out the above multi-modal features to Gemini Advanced subscribers as part of the "Google One AI Premium plan on Android devices." While the company didn't specify exactly when we can see it on our devices, it did say "later this month" so we're hoping it could arrive on the next monthly update.</p><p>However, those present at the MWC can go check out all of Google's offerings at Android Avenue between Halls 2 and 3.  "Try out these demos, and explore the show floor to collect our special edition Android pins at our partners’ booths," Google added.</p>

The company has already launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series</a> and the more recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Galaxy A series,</a> which are expected to be showcased at the event.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-solidifies-its-mobile-ai-leadership-at-mwc-2025-from-galaxy-ai-to-software-centric-networks">latest blog post</a>, Samsung has shared its plans for its product showcase at MWC. As we already know, Samsung and Google have come up with their own<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses"> Project Moohan </a>to produce the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> headset. It was initially showcased at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2024-live-blog-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-galaxy-s24-launch">Galaxy Unpacked</a> event in January, but nobody was allowed to get closer, let alone try it on. We're hoping for it this time at the MWC.</p>

<p>Per the blog post, the company reads, “Samsung will unveil its first Android XR headset, Project Moohan, offering a glimpse into the future of AI-powered extended reality."</p><p>It further adds that, with multimodal AI and advanced XR capabilities, this ground-breaking device marks a significant step toward more context-aware and personalized experiences that enhance everyday life in incredibly immersive ways."</p>
<p>Other than the Android XR headset, users can also expect a closer look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which was surprisingly dropped at the Unpacked event.</p><p>Although the Android XR headset is made in collaboration with Samsung and Google, consumers can expect Google Gemini at its core. Meaning, that interacting with the headset could be as conversation-friendly as Gemini Live coupled with multimodal AI insights within the headset and the apps that are being further utilized.</p><p>In the announcement from December, Samsung also explained the Android XR capabilities that can include “ state-of-the-art displays, Passthrough capabilities, and natural multi-modal input.” The headset also aims to be the spatial canvas to “explore the world through Google Maps,” enjoy a sports event on YouTube, and also to plan trips — all with the help of Gemini.</p><p>While we still don’t know what’s underneath the XR headset, it is promised to come in a lightweight design, which further includes ergonomics to ensure users have maximum comfort during use.</p><p>Visitors can explore these AI innovations firsthand at Samsung’s Galaxy Experience Booth in Fira Gran Via Hall 3.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-107">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Qualcomm’s X85 5G modem is here, promising faster speeds, better battery life, and smarter AI features for everything from flagship Android phones to PCs and IoT devices.</li><li>Expect 12.5 Gbps downloads and 3.7 Gbps uploads, plus 400MHz bandwidth.</li><li>A built-in AI accelerator makes the X85 30% faster at AI tasks, improving signal strength, reducing lag, and saving battery life.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/mwc-2025">MWC 2025</a>, Qualcomm unveiled the X85 5G modem, promising faster data speeds, improved energy efficiency, and advanced AI features for a broad range of devices, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">high-end Android smartphones</a> to PCs and IoT devices.</p><p>Qualcomm’s modems are what make 5G work in most smartphones and tablets today, and the new X85 is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x80-mwc-2024">big step up from its predecessors</a>. It brings some firsts to the table, like 400MHz bandwidth, along with peak download speeds of 12.5 Gbps and uploads hitting 3.7 Gbps.</p><p>At the core of the X85 is the Qualcomm 5G AI Processor, a built-in AI accelerator that’s part of the modem. It’s 30% faster at handling AI tasks than older versions, which means things run quicker, smarter, and with less drain on your battery, according to Qualcomm. This means you get better signal, less lag, and more efficient power use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HC4yQXJf426wSDbwE4rL3E" name="Qualcomm-X85-infographic" alt="Qualcomm X85 modem infographic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HC4yQXJf426wSDbwE4rL3E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With its AI-powered 5G Advanced features, the X85 also brings additional perks to the mix. Mobile gaming gets smoother, dual-SIM setups work smarter, and location tracking becomes more precise, as per Qualcomm.</p><p>The X85 also aims to fix some real annoyances. It is designed to keep your connection steady even in packed places and helps your battery go the extra mile. And it’s not just for phones. This modem is ready to work in all sorts of devices, from home internet setups and cars to big systems like railways.</p><p>The Qualcomm X85 5G is what’s powering Qualcomm’s new Dragonwing FWA Gen 4 Elite, the company's first 5G Advanced platform for fixed wireless internet.</p>

<p>Qualcomm has some big names in its corner for the X85, like China Telecom, Google, and Verizon.</p><p>And if the X85 seems a bit over the top for your needs, Qualcomm has also unveiled the X82 5G Modem-RF—a more down-to-earth option that still brings multi-gigabit speeds to a wider range of devices.</p><p>The X85 and X82 are already in the hands of manufacturers, so we should start seeing devices with these modems later this year.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If you buy an Android tablet today, it shouldn't be one that costs more than about $500. That goes for Apple, too... most people shouldn't buy an iPad costing more than that, either. The bottom line is that for the bulk of users, a tablet is a middling device — it just can't replace your favorite Android phone or your computer. That said, there are downright excellent tablets priced at roughly $400 or $500, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>.</p><p>Even still, Samsung doubled down on the premium Android tablet sector with the Galaxy Tab S10 series last year. It didn't release a base-model Galaxy Tab S10, instead choosing to only release Plus and Ultra models. That means the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus lineup starts at $1,000, with the highest-end Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra configuration — with 1TB of storage and 16GB RAM — costing a staggering $1,620.</p><p>That begs the question: Is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10">Galaxy Tab S10 Plus or Ultra</a> worth double or triple the price of the Pixel Tablet or OnePlus Pad 2? Is it twice as good, or does it provide an experience that's 2x better? Currently, the answer is a flat-out no. But if professional-grade apps start becoming a real part of Android — like Adobe's planned mobile Photoshop suite — that answer can change very fast.</p>

<p>I spent weeks testing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a> and Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus side-by-side, and both experiences were frustrating. Samsung seems to have the edge in multitasking, at least on paper, whereas Apple shines in app compatibility. Aside from Apple-owned apps Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, the iPad Pro also supports the iPadOS version of Photoshop — which gets close to matching the functionality of the desktop client.</p><p>It was hard for me to take the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus seriously as a $1,000 tablet when it runs the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-adobe-photoshop-on-your-phone-or-chromebook">Photoshop or Adobe Express apps</a> as a $100 Android device. The extra power might be there, but the software isn't taking advantage of it. That's why I'm particularly excited by the announcement that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/a-photoshop-app-for-android-is-coming-and-you-can-try-registering-for-the-beta-now">Adobe is bringing a true Photoshop app to Android</a>.</p><p>Make no mistake, this isn't an app on par with Photoshop's desktop version. With that being said, there is definitely reason to get excited about the upcoming Photoshop on Android app. It includes full support for PSD files and cloud syncing, as well as precise selection and editing tools, including removing, recoloring, and replacing objects. Firefly AI will be there too, with Generative Fill, Generative Expand, and Text to Image, plus the Spot Healing and Brush tools.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BLagfWWEWVGQbGvoyqWwxP" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-app-drawer.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra app drawer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BLagfWWEWVGQbGvoyqWwxP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android tablets like the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Ultra will immediately become more competitive with the iPad Pro — and laptops in general — with a capable Photoshop client. Currently, all that's available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> of all specs and price points is the weak Photoshop Express app, which pales in comparison to the rest of Adobe's software and inherently limits the Galaxy Tab's capabilities.</p><p>While Adobe's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/02/25/all-new-photoshop-iphone-app-reimagines-image-editing-for-mobile-creators?clickref=1011lAjjkPTK&mv=affiliate&mv2=pz&as_camptype=&as_channel=affiliate&as_source=partnerize&as_campaign=futurepublishing" target="_blank">blog post</a> is light on details, I'm hopeful that the new mobile app and web client will help premium Android tablets offer a better value proposition. With the new Photoshop app structure for Apple products, the iPhone gets a capable photo editing app, and the iPad gets an even more capable version with extra features. In a perfect world, this arrangement can be mimicked by Android phones and high-end Android tablets in the future.</p><p>I've reached out to Adobe to confirm whether the upcoming Photoshop on Android app will have full support and optimization for various display sizes, including tablets and foldables. I'll update this article when I hear back.</p><p>The good news is that even if support is spotty, Android users will always have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-sideloading">sideloading</a> and a web client to fall back on. No matter how this goes, the experience of photo editing on a premium Android tablet should be significantly improved.</p>

<p>As of now, I can't be convinced that an Android tablet costing $1,000 or more is worth your money. Everyone has different needs and use cases, but fundamentally, there currently aren't any professional or desktop-grade apps that can take advantage of the hardware a Galaxy Tab S10 Plus or Ultra offers. Yes, a Galaxy Tab S10 series device is great for content consumption, drawing or note-taking, and plenty of other things — but so could a OnePlus Pad 2 or Pixel Tablet costing half the price.</p><p>The dream scenario here is that Adobe sets an example for other Android developers, showing what's possible on the platform. I'm not opposed to recommending expensive Android tablets, but they need to deliver experiences worthy of their price tag. Today, I'll take a sub-$1,000 touchscreen laptop over a Galaxy Tab S10 Plus every single time.</p><p>If the Photoshop on Android app lives up to my expectations, and other devs follow in Adobe's footsteps, I think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">high-end Android tablets</a> can actually find a value proposition that makes sense.</p>

The latest model is getting one less update than the previous model.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="how-many-updates-does-the-watch-3-receive-2">How many updates does the Watch 3 receive?</h2>
<p>Tracking OnePlus Watch 3 updates is a must. Why? The more updates the smartwatch gets, the more features and security fixes you can enjoy. However, not all smartwatches get equal support.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3, unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review" target="_blank">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, is only guaranteed to get two software updates. OnePlus also promised two years of bi-monthly updates through early 2027. The previous generation of the brand's wearables was promised three years of Wear OS support, so it's disappointing to know that the latest model gets one less software update.</p><p>OnePlus' limited update policy might be a dealbreaker, as the Watch 3 falls behind Google's model by one update and Samsung's model by two. The OnePlus Watch 3 currently has Wear OS 5 with its RTOS, which helps provide multi-day battery life. But is that enough to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smartwatches-for-battery-life" target="_blank">best wearables</a>?</p><p>OnePlus has not confirmed the time frame for its two software updates. What we do know is that a new feature called 60-second Health Check-In with ECG will officially launch in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/oneplus-watch-3-key-features-available-time">March 2025 OTA update</a>. The health feature uses seven key indicators: vascular health, ECG, sleep monitoring, heart rate, SpO2, and wrist temperature.</p><p>With an estimated launch date of April 15, the OnePlus Watch 3 is expected to receive updates until 2027. However, OnePlus does not pinpoint how quickly it will release software updates.</p><p>Why are Wear OS updates so important? The Wear OS 3 rollout blunder left various wearables without Google Assistant support for years, ultimately pushing Fossil out of the update competition.</p><p>Samsung and Google are top contenders in providing long-term software support for their wearables. Currently, OnePlus is two years behind both. In comparison to brands such as TicWatch and Xiaomi, who offer no guaranteed update cycle, OnePlus at least provides two years of updates. That's an improvement, but three years of software updates would be even better.</p>

<p>Foldable phones aren’t cheap. They’re among the most premium, most expensive phones you can buy. But if you’ll make use of all its features and want to flex to your friends that you have one, there are many good options to consider. Two are the OPPO Find N5 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Both are great foldables, but they differ in ways that could help you decide between them.</p>

<p>If you loved the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>, you’ll be delighted with the OPPO Find N5, which serves as its successor. But before diving further into what makes this phone so great, it’s important to note the elephant in the room: it likely isn’t coming to North America. With that said, if you live elsewhere or can somehow get your hands on one, you’ll want to consider it.</p><p>Available in either black or a white pearlescent finish, it has a 6.62-inch outer screen that boasts 2,480 x 2,248-pixel resolution and an inner unfolded screen that’s a colossal 8.12 inches with 2,616 x 1,140-pixel resolution. The outer screen offers 2,100 nits peak brightness and 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate and the inner 2,450 nits peak brightness and the same adaptive refresh rate.</p><p>But what really makes this foldable stand out is that it’s the thinnest foldable you can find today, measuring a mere 8.93mm when folded and 4.21mm when unfolded. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">his review</a>, Harish Jonnalagadda says that because it’s so thin, you almost forget it’s not a regular, non-foldable phone.</p><p>When it comes to the screen, he loves the color vibrancy, which boasts Dolby Vision and HDR10+, describing it as “among the best of any foldable I’ve used.” There’s also eye comfort tone to help reduce eye strain, especially in dark settings, along with 2,160PMW comfortable dimming for low-light environments. There’s even a bedtime mode that can reduce blue light.</p><p>Encased in an Armor Shield housing, the OPPO Find N5 has a nanocrystal glass outer screen and UTG on the inner screen with dual layers of anti-impact films. It opens and closes using a 3D-printed titanium alloy Flexion hinge with a reduced crease that is virtually imperceptible when the phone is unfolded, says Jonnalagadda. Speaking of folding and unfolding, it can lock at any angle between 50° and 150°, which is super convenient.</p><p>While, like most foldables, this phone isn’t rated for protection against dust, it does sport impressive water-resistant ratings, including IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9, the latter of which is the highest you can get to ensure durability against not only water submersion, but even high-pressure jets.</p><p>The OPPO Find N5 runs ColorOS, which is based on Android, and comes with only one storage option of 512GB. It has a massive 5,600mAh OPPO Silicon-carbon battery that affords all-day use. This can equate to up to 25 hours of continuous video streaming or 8.6 hours of Zoom meetings (though who wants to do that?).</p><p>In his tests, Jonnalagadda confirms that the OPPO Find N5 lasts longer than any other foldable phone he has tested to date, up to a full day even with heavy use. Thanks to ultra-fast 80W SUPERVOOC wired charging and incredibly speedy 50W AIRVOOC wireless charging (with compatible chargers), it’s back up and running in no time as well.</p><p>You’ll get five Android platform updates and six years of security updates, decent protection for your investment. Indeed, this phone doesn’t come cheap. Then again, no foldable does.</p>

<p>Now, let’s consider how the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which was introduced in September 2024, compares. It comes in the usual Google finish flavors, Obsidian and Porcelain. The outer screen measures a slightly smaller 6.3 inches with a lesser 2,424 x 1,080 resolution and a 60-120Hz adaptive refresh rate. You’ll get up to 2,700 nits brightness, though.</p><p>The inner screen once unfolded is 8 inches, a smidge smaller, with a smaller 2,152 x 2,016 resolution, 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and up to 2,900 nits brightness. So, while the screens on this phone aren’t as high resolution (though likely via an imperceptible difference), they are ultra vibrant and bright, by comparison.</p><p>What’s worth noting is that while the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is not as thin nor as lightweight as the OPPO Find N5, it’s really only a few hairs (millimeters) thicker when both folded and unfolded, so it’s not a completely night and day experience. This is still a <em>really </em>slim phone.</p><p>Constructed with a satin metal frame with matte glass and a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 screen, it also sports a durable hinge made of multi-alloy steel with an aerospace-grade high-strength aluminum alloy cover. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">his review</a>, Andrew Myrick says he finds the phone slippery to hold without a case. You’ll want one anyway, though he does admit that it’s stunning in the looks department.</p><p>There’s standard water-resistance protection with an IPX8 rating. That’s nothing to discount, but it isn’t quite as durable as the OPPO Find N5 in this department. The phone comes with the option of 256GB or 512GB storage.</p><p>In terms of the battery, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a smaller 4,650mAh battery, though Google still rates it as being able to last all day. You can also leverage Extreme Battery Saver mode to get up to 72 hours of use per charge. Once ready to charge, it is compatible with 45W USB-C charging (charger sold separately) as well as wireless charging through Qi. Myrick says battery life was better than he expected, and he loves the option for wireless charging when using a MagSafe case. Just make sure to find a case with the proper alignment, which rules out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-stand-2nd-gen-charger-review">Pixel Stand V2</a>.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold runs Android 14 but it comes with seven years of OS and security updates, giving you even more peace of mind that you can use the phone for many years to come.</p>
<h2 id="oppo-find-n5-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-the-specs-2">OPPO Find N5 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold: The specs</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<h2 id="oppo-find-n5-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-usability-and-features-2">OPPO Find N5 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Usability and features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vCMDvCbBo9qGhPSvUfpVo4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 drawer on the taskbar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCMDvCbBo9qGhPSvUfpVo4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, we have established that both these phones are beautifully designed with bright screens, wonderful folding capabilities, and ultra-thin designs. Now, it comes down to how they function with day-to-day use and what they can do.</p><p>The OPPO Find N5 runs on the ColorOS, which is based on Android 15. It also has a trinity engine and generous 16GB RAM, so it will keep up with all your multitasking needs, videos, gaming, and more. It uses a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and Jonnalagadda finds that it runs just as well as other premium phones that have this same processor. There was some throttling, however, so it doesn’t live up to the same thermal thresholds.</p><p>Phones nowadays are all about the AI experience, and the OPPO Find N5 delivers the full Google Gemini experience, with features like AI Translate, dual-screen interpreter, AI Assistant for documents, AI call summaries, and Circle to Search.</p><p>There are a few neat stand-out features with this phone. This includes a 360° surround, AI-driven adaptive antenna system that can apparently adjust the signal based on how you hold the phone. In comparing it to other phones he has recently tested, Jonnalagadda says the OPPO Fins N5 affords reliable connectivity, so perhaps this technology really does work.</p><p>By downloading the O+ Connect app to your Mac, you can also enable a Mac Remote feature. Once connected, use the phone to search, access, edit, and sync files on your Mac remotely. There are also useful features like split and boundless views. All your files are protected as well thanks to theft protection and delete file encryption.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DLQafRTYoDpJydKNjLLvsB" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-15.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review -" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DLQafRTYoDpJydKNjLLvsB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not surprisingly, the AI experience is top-notch with the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Running Android 14 out of the box (though you can update to Android 15 now) with a Google Tensor 4 chip, it has the same 16GB RAM, which will delight heavy users and mobile gamers.</p><p>Google AI is fully integrated into the experience, from the Google AI assistant to features like summarizing e-mails, Circle to Search, Google Translate, and, of course, Google Gemini for assisting in just about anything you are doing, want to do, or are starting to plan to do. In fact, you can take the experience a step further since a purchase of the phone comes with a one-year subscription to Gemini Advanced to try out everything it has to offer.</p><p>The Google AI experience, Myrick notes, is virtually identical to what you’ll get in other new Pixel phones in terms of capabilities, features, and limitations. Indeed, it sort of works sometimes and doesn’t at others. But this is true for any phone with Gemini, not just this one.</p><p>There are some other unique features worth mentioning with this phone, too. Leverage the split screen feature to use two apps side by side. You can drag and drop items from one app to another. There’s also a feature that can automatically detect and filter spam calls. With the Titan M2 security chip and built-in VPN, you can also be assured that your personal data is protected.</p>
<h2 id="oppo-find-n5-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-how-do-the-camera-compare-2">OPPO Find N5 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold: How do the camera compare?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="78YZ55uYJ5Rkbk7F8Pcvf4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 back view highlighting design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78YZ55uYJ5Rkbk7F8Pcvf4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Who doesn’t take photos from their phones nowadays? With foldable phones affording even more convenient ways to take images, essentially with their own built-in tripods, you’ll want to know which phone yields the better turnout.</p><p>The OPPO Find N5 has a camera system that was co-developed with Hasselblad, which already tells you that there are pretty solid cameras built into this device. This triple-camera system includes a 50MP HyperTone wide-angle lens with OIS, a 50MP Samsung telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and an 8MP wide-angle. For the front, it’s another 8MP camera.</p><p>Since the camera bump protrudes quite a bit from the back, Jonnalagadda says you will find that there’s a slight wobble when you try to take pics with the unfolded phone resting on a table or other flat surface.</p><p>Enjoy tons of AI camera shooting features, including AI telescope zoom, telephoto macro camera, LivePhoto, portrait mode, soft light portrait, and new film style. There’s even an option to add a personalized watermark to your images. For AI editing, use features like AI Clarity Enhancer, AI Eraser, AI Unblur, and AI Reflection Remover. With the FlexForm camera, you can use the rear cameras to take selfies from different angles, like a high-res selfie or waist-level framing.</p><p>Jonnalagadda was thoroughly impressed with the cameras in this phone, calling the images he was able to take in daylight “outstanding,” highlighting the wonderful dynamic range and white balance. They deliver natural colors with no aggressive smoothing or oversaturation. Even macro photos turned out great. The only weak point, he feels, is the wide-angle lens, though he admits it still takes decent photos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PXm3NvfaCsW5LSYMPay5QN" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-18.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold angled view of back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXm3NvfaCsW5LSYMPay5QN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cameras in the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold are similar in comparison, based on specs. You get a 48MP main wide-angle camera along with a 10.5MP ultra-wide lens with Macro focus, 10.8MP rear, 10MP cover, and a 10MP camera inside. There’s also 5x telephoto zoom and up to 20x Super Res Zoom so you can get up close and personal with subjects that might be far away, from birds to your kid’s amazing goal at the soccer game.</p><p>Myrick finds that photos are hit-and-miss with the cameras in this phone, largely dependent on the scenario and conditions in which you’re trying to shoot.</p><p>Google really hits it out of the park with fun and useful photo features, though. There’s the option to use the rear camera for a front screen preview of an image you’re about to take. Parents will love Made You Look, which displays fun pics to make kids laugh or smile so you get the perfect shot. Myrick found that the feature works incredibly well, especially with his fidgety 8-month-old. Leverage tabletop mode to take timed group shots, timelapse, astro photos and more. You can even just say “Hey Google, take a photo” and it will.</p><p>The pièce de résistance is Add Me, which allows the photographer to add themselves to a group photo after the fact so that no one is left out. Best Take is another fan favorite, which allows you to combine the best expressions or backgrounds from various burst photos to save the, well, best take. Of course, you also get other great Pixel photo features you know and love from other Pixel devices, like Magic Eraser, Magic Editor, Photo Unblur, and more.</p>

<p>We’re not going to lie: when deciding between the OPPO Find N5 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, it’s a tough decision. The one easy deciding factor could simply be availability. If you’re in North America and can’t get your hands on the OPPO Find N5, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is a fine foldable that won’t disappoint, and your only choice between the two.</p><p>If you have the opportunity to buy either one, this is when it gets murkier. They are both great phones, but the OPPO Find N5 improves in virtually every department, from the screen sizes and resolution to the thinner and more durable design, the larger battery, infinitely faster charging, and better cameras. There’s just that one nagging annoyance that you might not be able to get it.</p><p>If you’re looking for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phone</a>, there are other models to consider as well from Samsung, Motorola, and the aforementioned OnePlus Open which <em>is </em>available in North America. But between these two devices, the OPPO Find N5 is the choice to make if it’s available to you. If not, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is still a great foldable with fun features and lots of AI goodies.</p><p>The good news is that since the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is guaranteed software support for so long, you can invest now. Once Google follows up with something vastly improved, you can get good trade-in or resale value for this one. Then, upgrade after having enjoyed the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold to familiarize yourself with the world of foldable phones.</p>

<ul><li>Smart Connect, used by nine million monthly active users, is getting new updates.</li><li>The Smart Connect gets a new customizable dashboard alongside third-party integration that lets more Android users experience the feature.</li><li>The aim of the new AI features incorporation is to retrieve information in seconds, further saving consumers time and energy.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Smart Connect is a cross-device management solution that works seamlessly between Motorola and Lenovo devices, which is now getting new updates alongside some useful AI features.</p><p>The company has announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a> will be receiving new features in the coming weeks that include a redesigned dashboard, third-party integration, and a couple of AI-powered features. While select Motorola and Lenovo users can download the update through Google Play Store, Windows PC users (Windows 10 and above) can get it through the Microsoft Store.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="vv8tucBsSues88gisqSy93" name="Smart-Connect-update-02" alt="Smart Connect new update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vv8tucBsSues88gisqSy93.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smart Connect's new customized dashboard, now showcases users' compatible devices including Moto Tag, Moto Buds, Lenovo Tabs, and PCs. The company notes that this should help users manage, add, or disconnect devices easily and also check their battery life. Third-party integration with the latest update will also allow more Android users to experience the benefits of Smart Connect features.</p><p>Other than cross-device integration and file management, the Smart Connect feature will now have a boost of Moto AI to elevate the experience. For instance, with a quick voice or text command, users will be able to cast their phone's content to TV, PC, or a tablet — during a presentation, for example.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="AYPns9Rbtibdop6q5YJt83" name="Smart-Connect-update-01" alt="Smart Connect new update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYPns9Rbtibdop6q5YJt83.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AI Search further allows users to utilize natural language to roll out some basic tasks, like bringing out documents from their tablet, like a bank statement, rental agreement, or a hotel bill stored on the Lenovo Yoga Tab Plus tablet, the company explains in a shared press release.</p><p>"Say a user is returning from a weeklong business trip and needs to submit their expense report. They can forget about manually sorting through various folders or files. Instead, they simply ask Smart Connect to “grab my restaurant receipts” in a natural way, as if they were speaking to a friend."</p><p>The aim is to retrieve information in seconds, further saving consumers time and energy. It is good to see Smart Connect gaining AI benefits alongside its core features like Miracast display connectivity, Smart Clipboard, and App Streaming, which is believed to be utilized by over nine million monthly users.</p>

<p>Google wants <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome</a> for Android to feel more immersive, so apps will now stretch to the very edges of your screen, right under the status and navigation bars.</p><p>The search giant announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/edge-to-edge" target="_blank">community post</a> that it started testing a new version of Chrome for Android that aims to maximize your screen space for a smoother, more immersive experience (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/02/chrome-135-edge-to-edge-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The visual below shows Chrome's UI stretching seamlessly to the bottom edge, with content flowing into the navigation bar area.</p>

<p>According to Google, the new Chrome update brings a smart bottom bar that disappears when you scroll, freeing up more space for content under the navigation bar.</p><p>The Chrome team made sure it works with current mobile web designs, but Google is also warning developers to watch out for possible overlaps with the gesture navigation bar.</p><p>This is a big shift from the current setup, where the gesture pill sits on a plain, solid-color background. The new tweak has a more dynamic look, with content flowing right behind it.</p><p>When the update is rolled out to everyone, the gesture handle will float over content on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a> as you scroll. But when you’re not scrolling and the address bar is visible, it’ll go back to the classic solid-color background.</p><p>Even though edge-to-edge screen rendering is possible, it hasn’t been widely adopted because of some real-world design challenges. For one, app controls and the system’s navigation bar can end up on top of each other, leading to accidental taps or swipes.</p><p>To tackle these issues, Google last year gave developers the tools and guidance needed for smooth edge-to-edge rendering. The tech giant also sent out a heads-up, warning that apps without the right updates might run into display glitches.</p><p>Google has started rolling out the edge-to-edge layout in Chrome 135 for Android, but it’s only live for a small group of users right now.</p>

<ul><li>HMD’s Amped Earbuds come with a charging case that can also wirelessly power up your phone.</li><li>The 1,600mAh Qi2 case doubles as a power bank for iPhones, HMD’s Skyline, and other compatible phones.</li><li>The case is thicker at 14mm and features a unique hinge system for storing and charging the buds.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>HMD has introduced a fresh take on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>, and they’re not your average pair. These come with a charging case that can also give your phone a quick power boost when it’s running low.</p><p>At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/mwc-2025">MWC in Barcelona</a>, HMD unveiled the Amped Earbuds, a fresh addition to its accessory lineup. What makes them stand out is their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">Qi2</a> reverse charging case. With a 1,600mAh battery, it doesn’t just juice up the earbuds: it doubles as a wireless power bank for compatible phones, including iPhones and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD’s own Skyline</a>.</p><p>HMD also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_int/press/hmd-amped-buds-press-release" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that the Amped Buds' charging case works even if your phone has a protective case with a magnetic ring. This means it’s built to play nice with pretty much any phone that supports wireless charging.</p><p>This clever two-in-one design gives the Amped Earbuds an edge, making them a standout in the crowded world of audio gear.</p><p>HMD says the case’s battery can give your iPhone 16 Pro a 20% boost wirelessly, or bump it up to 24% if you plug in with a USB-C cable.</p><p>At first look, the earbuds seem like your typical wireless earbuds, with just a slightly different stem design to set them apart. It’s chunkier than usual at 14mm thick, and the hinge system for storing and charging the earbuds is a nifty little detail you don’t see every day.</p><p>The earbuds use a spring-loaded system; pop them in or out of the case, and you’ll hear and feel a tiny click. And when you pull them out, the stems tilt forward, so they sit just right in your ears.</p>

<p>The sound comes through 10mm drivers, and you can tweak the audio to your liking using a mobile app that works on both Android and iOS.</p><p>For audio clarity, the Amped Buds pack both active and environmental noise cancellation. As for durability, the case has IPX4 dust resistance, and the earbuds come with IP54 splash resistance.</p><p>HMD claims the Amped Buds last up to 4 hours with ANC on and 8 hours in regular mode. With a fully charged case, you’re looking at a total of around 95 hours of playtime.</p><p>The HMD Amped Earbuds arrive in April for €199, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/622443/hmd-amped-earbuds-battery-case-qi2-charging" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, but there’s no word yet on a U.S. release.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Despite the somewhat underwhelming appeal of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> strictly on the spec sheet, Samsung has somehow found a way to make it a compelling flagship. After spending weeks with the smartphone as my daily driver, I happen to specifically enjoy the compact form factor and lightweight build. With that being said, the more and more I use the Galaxy S25, the more clear it becomes that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> is a huge selling point for this lineup.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, you get the best of both worlds in terms of smartphone AI. Of course, there's Galaxy AI, which is Samsung's in-house suite of AI tools. However, on top of that, the Galaxy S25 also supports a large variety of Google AI features — including the new agentic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, Circle to Search, and Magic Editor, for starters. Crucially, Samsung is offering an unprecedented level of control over where your data is processed with its recent Galaxy lineups.</p><p>In the <strong>Galaxy AI </strong>tab in the Settings app for the Galaxy S25, there's a toggle called <strong>Process data only on device</strong>. It does exactly what it sounds like. "For added privacy, you can prevent collection and processing of your data for Galaxy AI's advanced intelligence features," the company explains. "Online processing provides the best results and is required for some advanced intelligence features."</p>

<p>To be fair, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a> isn't new at all. The Samsung Galaxy S25 uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy </a>chip for on-device AI computing, just like how a Google Pixel phone uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip for the same thing. In fact, the Galaxy S24 has this very same toggle available. The key difference here is that Google doesn't let you switch off cloud processing altogether, and compared to the Galaxy S24, the newer Galaxy S25 can run many more Galaxy AI features on-device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8je8SnkHAN2KBxVdnUNcTK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-7" alt="Android eating Baklava generated on Galaxy S25 Ultra using Galaxy AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8je8SnkHAN2KBxVdnUNcTK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An image generated with AI using the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Last year, disabling cloud processing for Galaxy AI meant leaving behind nearly all of the suite's best features. Thanks to the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip, that isn't necessary anymore. You can use some or all of the following Galaxy AI feature with on-device processing on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>:</p>
<ul><li>Call Assist</li><li>Writing Assist</li><li>Interpreter</li><li>Note Assist</li><li>Transcript Assist</li><li>Browsing Assist</li></ul>
<p>This makes using on-device processing only on your Samsung Galaxy S25 a much more viable option this year compared to last. Of course, there are still some sacrifices to be made. Summarization features across Writing Assist, Note Assist, and Browsing Assist won't work with cloud processing disabled. Moreover, the best Photo Assist features — including Sketch to edit and Portrait studio — won't work with on-device processing either.</p><p>Regardless, these limitations are a bit easier to concede with the Galaxy S25, since you retain access to some of the more useful Galaxy AI tools. It's at least worth considering for the extremely privacy-conscious, even if many Galaxy S25 users aren't likely to flip the toggle on. I probably won't restrict my Galaxy phone to on-device AI either, but there's something to be said about Samsung at least giving users the final choice — that's more than Google or Apple can say. That's what Android is all about, after all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tSX8PCRhqmicp6VXHdA92e" name="Galaxy-S25-On-Device-AI-2" alt="The option for processing all data on-device." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tSX8PCRhqmicp6VXHdA92e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If I'm a Pixel or iPhone user today, I'm envious of the choice Samsung is providing to Galaxy S25 users — and even users of older Galaxy phones. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a> can use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-gemini-nano-available-for-all-android-apps">Gemini Nano model</a> to process data on-device, there's no way to force the smartphone to <em>only</em> use on-device processing.</p><p>The same goes for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-has-turned-into-just-another-tech-company">the iPhone 16 series and its A18 chips</a>. Apple has the groundbreaking Private Cloud Compute system for off-device processing, but it does not tell the end user exactly where their data is being processed for any specific feature. There's a degree of uncertainty there that requires a level of trust. For some, it doesn't make sense to put trust in AI and corporate data collection.</p><p>Even the Galaxy S25 isn't perfect, if only because Samsung can only control what it can control. The on-device processing toggle only covers Galaxy AI features — it excludes any Google AI or Gemini features. Still, Samsung is setting the standard for user choice when it comes to on-device processing for AI features, and it deserves a commendation for that.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-127">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Infinix enters the tri-fold segment with the Zero Mini Tri-Fold, featuring dual vertical hinges for a three-way fold.</li><li>The concept's outward-folding design lets it attach to fitness gear and bikes, adding extra versatility.</li><li>Its dual-screen setup enables real-time translation, multitasking, and a pro-level camera experience.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Infinix is finally jumping in with its own tri-fold design, called the Zero Mini Tri-Fold, which boasts dual vertical hinges that let it fold three ways.</p><p>The Infinix Zero Mini concept introduces triple-fold design, powered by dual vertical hinges. Unlike your typical <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> that just stretch into bigger screens, Infinix's latest concept phone can switch between being a compact phone, a fitness gadget you can wear, and a portable camera setup, according to the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/infinix-unveils-zero-series-mini-tri-fold-a-game-changing-foldable-concept-302387349.html" target="_blank">press release</a>.</p><p>With its outward-folding design, the Zero Mini goes beyond a regular phone. It can attach to fitness gear and bikes, making it even more versatile.</p><p>The Zero Mini’s outward-folding design gives you a dual-screen setup that’s perfect for multitasking. It can handle real-time translation and display content at the same time.</p><p>When it’s time to snap some photos, the setup doubles as a pro-level camera system. You get crisp, high-res shots with the main lens while using the second screen to nail the perfect frame.</p>

<p>The prototype sports a hole-punch display and packs a dual-camera setup.</p><p>Currently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT is the only triple-folding smartphone</a> you can actually buy.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/who-would-buy-a-samsung-galaxy-g-fold-multi-foldable-phone">dipping its toes into the tri-fold concept too</a>, working on a book-style foldable phone of its own. The South Korean tech giant gave us a sneak peek of what’s in the works at its Galaxy Unpacked event back in January of this year.</p><p>Infinix is keeping the details under wraps for now, meaning there's no word on a release date or specs for the Zero Series Mini. But rumor has it we’ll get the full scoop at Mobile World Congress 2025.</p>

With an aluminum chassis, a powerful MediaTek processor, a gorgeous 144Hz display, and <em>eight</em> speakers for the ultimate in surround sound from a tablet, this one means business.</p><p>It's the perfect tablet for productivity <em>and</em> media consumption, offering everything you need to feel good about using it full-time. It's got full support for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/global/accessories/honor-magic-pencil-3/">Honor Magic Pencil 3</a> and a keyboard folio case that turns it into a laptop replacement, plus a 10,100mAh battery that'll last all day long on a single charge.</p><p>Honor's strengthened partnership with Google means that it's even got Google Kids Space support out of the box, so you can set it up entirely for your kids to use with a special home screen launcher and set of apps or just make them their own profile with all the same great parental control features. Really, it's hard to know why you would need any other tablet.</p>

<p>The Honor Pad V9 was announced on MWC 2025 on March 2, 2025.</p><p>The tablet is expected to retail for around $400 and is the follow-up to 2022's Honor Pad V8 Pro.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oqpd2gvmMMJgZt6sQ5cAMM" name="honor-pad-v9-display-camera-scan-01" alt="A ramen cooking comic on the display of the Honor Pad V9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oqpd2gvmMMJgZt6sQ5cAMM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Honor Pad V9 has stunning physical features, and it's hard to pick the best one. The aluminum unibody design feels incredibly high-quality and far better than you might expect from a sub-$400 tablet. The bezels around the display are just the right size — not too big to look ugly and not too small to be uncomfortable — and the tablet is thin enough to be comfortable without being so thin that it's awkward to hold.</p><p>LCD screens <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-16e-oled-display-signals-death-of-lcd">aren't necessarily considered "premium"</a> these days, but the one on the Honor Pad V9 might have you rethinking that position. At 144Hz, it's buttery smooth and uses dynamic dimming and refresh rate scaling to save on battery. The backlight looks superb and avoids the cheap glow or light bleed issues some LCD panels suffer from. It's also got incredible viewing angles and black levels, once again showing that this is better than the average LCD panel.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uh0ShSU8PEU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>It's a proper DC-dimmed panel and uses no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, earning the full TÜV Rheinland Flicker Free Eye Comfort Certification rating. Plus, it blocks blue light at the hardware level and incorporates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magicpad-2-honor-magic-v3-ai-defocus-display">Honor's Defocus Display tech,</a> so you can feel comfortable using it night and day without eye strain.</p><p>Aside from the quality, the display is coated with a NIL Nano-topography process that keeps it impressively fingerprint-resistant. I've let my son play on this thing for hours and can't believe how little there is to clean off the screen. I'd love to see some kind of anti-glare layer on this display in the future but it's still plenty bright and easy to see in a well-lit car.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6QnMZzAymyqVMN2G7vB7de" name="honor-pad-v9-charging-01" alt="Charging the Honor Pad V9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6QnMZzAymyqVMN2G7vB7de.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Among the most premium features is the IMAX certified 8-speaker setup. Yeah, seriously, Honor packed <em>eight speakers</em> inside of this tablet, complete with impressive bass response. Movies and videos sounded best, with crystal clear voices and mind-bowing virtual surround sound.</p><p>I did a sort of double-take more than once while watching videos on this thing, wondering if it somehow was hooked up to my surround sound system in the living room. It sounds good enough to listen to music on all the time and I had it pumping beats on my desk while I was working more than once during the review period.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gqqcCdn4zsowNbqsnxt9uN" name="honor-pad-v9-google-kids-space-home-screen" alt="Google Kids Space running on the Honor Pad V9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gqqcCdn4zsowNbqsnxt9uN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Parents will be thrilled to know that this tablet features Google Kids Space support out of the box. When setting up any account, it'll ask you if the account is for a child or an adult. Choosing child will enable a special setup that requires a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-create-google-account-your-kid-through-family-link">Google Family Link account</a>, complete with a special home screen, app launcher, curated content, and more.</p><p>The MediaTek Dimensity 8350 Elite inside is a great processor that's somewhere in-between a mid-range and a top-end processor. It feels like a high-end processor in most scenarios, including everyday usage, browsing, and productivity. Gaming on the tablet is a joy although you won't be able to run Fortnite at max settings and still expect a buttery-smooth 60FPS framerate.</p><p>If you or your kids are looking for a great tablet that supports a stylus, this is a solid choice. It works perfectly with the Honor Magic Pencil 3, including handwriting recognition and Honor's really cool <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-magicpad-2-ai-math-equation-digitizer">math formula recognition technology</a>. This functionality along with Kids Space makes this an ideal family tablet, especially since you can have multiple account profiles.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sqLMehCp86PYXhyApLbsqN" name="honor-pad-v9-display-quick-toggles-notification-shade" alt="The waste of space that occurs when pulling up the split notification pane on the Honor Pad V9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sqLMehCp86PYXhyApLbsqN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">affordable tablet</a>, you'll find that Honor sells other tablets with faster processors, bigger and brighter displays, and slightly better speakers. I wouldn't say any of these are huge differences from what's offered on the Honor Pad V9, but know that this isn't quite a top-of-the-line tablet despite its premium leanings. It also has no water or dust ingress protection, so this one might not be best for bathtub reading time.</p><p>On the software side of things, Honor does a great job of enabling laptop-level multitasking and performance in many areas, but it needs to tweak just two things to bring this all the way to a laptop-replacement level. The taskbar at the bottom of the screen cannot be pinned in Magic OS 9 as it can on most other major Android-based tablets with the latest versions of Android.</p><p>Second, the notification shade is still split, so only quick toggles appear when you swipe down from the right side of the status bar, while only notifications appear from the left side. There's no reason these shouldn't be in the same notification shade as there's plenty of room for both — Honor's design even leaves a goofy white space on each half of the notification shade that <em>should</em> contain the other half.</p>

<p>No matter where you live, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">best Samsung tablets</a> are often the biggest competition for the Honor Pad V9. The closest specific competitor is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 FE,</a> which is in the same price range as the Honor Pad V9. Samsung offers a lot of similar functionality to the Honor Pad V9 including stylus support and a great OS for multitasking. However, Honor outclasses Samsung in most other areas, including processor performance, display quality and refresh rate, eye-friendly display options, and much more RAM.</p><p>If you're a smart home aficionado and use Google Home as your main control point, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> is a pretty nifty choice. It's got a great charging stand that doubles as a powerful speaker, plus a custom lock screen that lets you control your Google Home-powered smart home faster than anything else. It's got a slightly better multitasking UI than Honor — the taskbar can be properly pinned to the bottom of the screen — but the processor is a lot slower, and it only has 8GB of RAM, while Honor offers a Pad V9 model with 12GB.</p><p>Internationally, companies like Xiaomi offer tablets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmi-pad-pro-review">Redmi Pad Pro</a> that look <em>very</em> similar on paper. Honor offers more storage and RAM for its two models as well as a newer version of Android, plus a much faster processor. Xiaomi has the price advantage, though, and some people may prefer Xiaomi's Android skin over Honor's.</p>

<p>The Honor Pad V9 sits nicely between cheap tablets like the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and more premium options like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>. It's got a powerful newer MediaTek processor, an incredible 144Hz display that'll have you wondering why more LCDs aren't this good, as well as an impressive 8-speaker system that sounds too good to be in a tablet.</p><p>Honor even launched this one with the latest version of Android, fixing past mistakes. It also includes Honor's latest display eye care solutions, support for its best tablet accessories like the Magic Pencil 3, and battery life that'll get you through the longest of flights. It's a superb choice, so long as you don't need something special like ingress protection or cellular connectivity.</p>

There has been a sizeable interest in this category in the last 12 months, and Honor's buds combine a lightweight design with a comfortable fit and engaging sound signature. <br><br>What's so good about open earbuds is that they don't actually fit inside the ear, so you don't need to worry about any strain even with extended use. That said, because they don't create a tight seal, you don't get the same sound quality, but manufacturers have come up with interesting solutions to deliver powerful bass, and Honor in particular did a terrific job in this area. <br><br>I tested several open earbuds, and after using the Earbuds Open for a week, it's evident that these are among the best you can get right now.</p>

<p>Honor unveiled the Earbuds Open alongside the Pad V9 at its Mobile World Congress keynote on March 2, and the earbuds are going on sale shortly. Similar to the manufacturer's other devices, the Earbuds Open will be coming to the U.K. and other global markets in the coming weeks.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-earbuds-open-what-i-like"><span>Honor Earbuds Open: What I like</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d9RqevviA2q75ZYyK3cs8A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d9RqevviA2q75ZYyK3cs8A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I generally like open earbuds as they have a better fit than in-ear models, and that's no different with the Earbuds Open. I think these may be the most comfortable earbuds I've used yet, and while I tested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/baseus-eli-sport-1-review">Baseus's take in this category</a> and am going through several other models — this is clearly the latest trend in audio — Honor's design is the one that stands out the most.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ptuxGBqQmJQ6gUSt2otd6A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ptuxGBqQmJQ6gUSt2otd6A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A big part of that has to do with the unique design. The Earbuds Open have ear hooks that ensure they don't fall out even when you're running, and as the driver doesn't actually nestle into your ear canal — it's designed to sit outside the ear — it doesn't exert any pressure on the inner ear cavity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G33rPVkULv5eEpE24jLM5A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G33rPVkULv5eEpE24jLM5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Because of the design, you can hear ambient noise in your surroundings while still getting immersive sound, and there's no audio leakage, so no one in your near vicinity will be able to hear what you're listening to — which is a good thing for me as I mostly listen to heavy metal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="A8uJu4SgFVngGSNfiggW5A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A8uJu4SgFVngGSNfiggW5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The ear hooks have a natural curve and are made out of an alloy that makes it easy to adjust the fit comfortably. The chassis is fashioned out of silicone, and I didn't see any issues with the build quality. The earbuds weigh just 7.9g each, so there's absolutely no fatigue even with all-day use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wryWGgo9xLs273K39xFj6A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wryWGgo9xLs273K39xFj6A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can get the earbuds in Polar Gold and Polar Black, and I'd recommend getting the gold model if you want earbuds with a bit of a design flair. The black model is muted, and it doesn't have a strong presence; so if that's what you need, it's a good option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TaJdWJrdciUzDD45BA3M9A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TaJdWJrdciUzDD45BA3M9A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The case has an oblong design to accommodate the unique nature of the earbuds, and while it is wider than most earbud cases, it is still easily pocketable. Pairing the buds is about as easy as it gets (they connect over Bluetooth 5.2), and I didn't have any issues in this area. I got good range too, with the earbuds delivering a rock-solid connection even when I around the house doing chores. If you're prone to losing earbuds, there's a nifty locate option that uses Bluetooth.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SWjkUKn5B6y29d85wCan7A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SWjkUKn5B6y29d85wCan7A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get IP54 ingress protection, and they hold up incredibly well during workouts thanks to the ear hooks. Interestingly, you get ANC on these earbuds, and while the isolation isn't as high as regular earbuds — the Buds 3 Pro manage to tune out sounds up to 40db, while the Earbuds Open can do so up to 24dB — it is a considerable achievement that this is available on open earbuds at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FRgBGzFnSLVTASgyLtRo6A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FRgBGzFnSLVTASgyLtRo6A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the earbuds did a decent enough job with ambient sounds like that of an air conditioning unit, they're not quite as effective if you're in a noisy cafe. There's environmental noise isolation as well, with the earbuds doing a great job blocking out the wind, and it is easily noticeable while making calls outdoors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ptuxGBqQmJQ6gUSt2otd6A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ptuxGBqQmJQ6gUSt2otd6A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used a half-dozen open earbuds until now, and I'm constantly amazed by how good they sound. You wouldn't think that the sound quality would be on par with regular earbuds as they don't go into your ear, but that isn't the case at all — if anything, the Earbuds Open sound better than most in-ear models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bzG989ZJWGwz6fiQuTMU7A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bzG989ZJWGwz6fiQuTMU7A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What surprised me the most is the bass; the Earbuds Open have a vibrant and engaging bass that works across genres, and you somehow get a noticeable rumble even though the sound tube doesn't wedge into the inner ear. There's good mid-range clarity, with vocals shining through and decent instrument separation. There's some harshness with the treble at times, but you don't get much in the way of sibilance. Overall, I'd sum up the sound quality as lively; it lends itself well to diverse genres, and Honor did a great job with the tuning.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JDQtKyfsaSS2rudvSFAx6A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JDQtKyfsaSS2rudvSFAx6A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like with everything else Honor is doing, the Earbuds Open pick up AI-assisted features, including real-time translations. It is available in 15 languages, but I wasn't able to make full use of it as it doesn't have Hindi or Telugu (yet). That said, it works with Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and Portuguese in addition to other languages, and it is a nifty addition. <br><br>You get three modes: Shared Mode is ideal when you need instantaneous translations, Simultaneous Interpretation is pretty cool in that it spits out translations in two languages at once (with one language in each earbud), and Exclusive Mode is useful if you're in a country where you don't know the language. In this mode, you talk into the earbuds and the connected phone's speaker puts out the translation in the language selected in real-time.</p>

<p>Finally, the battery life is decent. Each bud houses a 58mAh battery and lasts just under six hours between charges, and there's a 480mAh battery within the case that charges the buds two and a half times over. Basically, you get over 20 hours of usage before needing to charge the case. On that note, there's fast charging, so a 15-minute charge delivers two hours of music playback.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hrYzkPdTtf2rgkwHeJqF5A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hrYzkPdTtf2rgkwHeJqF5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't really have many negatives to point out with the buds. I would have liked the integration of AptX codecs, but that clearly isn't a priority in this category, and it isn't a huge omission al things considered.</p><p>The buds have gesture controls, but they tend to be finicky at times, and I ran into issues getting a gesture to trigger reliably. The only other point is the fit; while I like the way they sit outside the ear, they may not be suitable to everyone, and if it's possible, I'd recommend trying out the buds if you're interested in the design.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kZZhgeUYGm9MMZ3nDzup5A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kZZhgeUYGm9MMZ3nDzup5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like what Nothing is doing in this category, and its earbuds combine a comfortable fit with great sound. Coming in at €149, they are costlier, but you also get a good value considering the uniqueness of the design and engaging sound. <br><br>Soundcore's AeroFit Pro share a lot of the same attributes as Honor's earbuds, and they have decent sound combined with useful workout extras, including IPX5.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-earbuds-open-should-you-buy-it"><span>Honor Earbuds Open: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8QHcc8FMTwntwtRe4tkf7A" name="Honor Earbuds Open" alt="Honor Earbuds Open photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8QHcc8FMTwntwtRe4tkf7A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy these if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want earbuds that are highly comfortable</li><li>You need great sound quality with powerful bass</li><li>You want good battery life</li><li>You need workout earbuds</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy these if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best noise isolation</li><li>You need high-res codecs</li></ul>
<p>Outside of AptX codecs, you're not really missing out on much with the Earbuds Open. Honor did a terrific job with the design and build quality of the earbuds, and they're easily one of the most comfortable I've used in this category. <br><br>The fact that you don't have any fatigue even with all-day use is a big deal, and that's driven by the unique design where the driver sits outside the ear. You still get wonderfully detailed sound, and Honor somehow managed to deliver powerful bass here, and they hold up well with genres as diverse as heavy metal and classical. <br><br>There are other niceties too; IP54 ingress protection is great to have, and the earbuds do a solid job tuning out ambient sounds. They're not quite as effective as regular earbuds, but there is a noticeable difference regardless, and if you usually have issues with earbuds and want something that's much more comfortable, I highly recommend giving the Earbuds Open a chance — I was pleasantly astonished by how good they are, and you will be too.</p>

<ul><li>Honor shares its plans to become an AI device ecosystem company at MWC.</li><li>We can expect an intelligent phone to incorporate human-centric AI built to maximize human potential.</li><li>Honor also shared its plans to bring the world's first GUI (Graphical User Interface)-based mobile AI agent.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As MWC has just begun, Honor has announced that it aims to convert the company into a global AI device ecosystem. To do so, the company has announced that it is introducing a new Honor Alpha Plan, a three-step strategy, that focuses on intelligent phones, AI ecosystem, and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).</p><p>According to Honor, the new Alpha plan comprises three steps that include the development of an intelligent phone, opening industry boundaries, and co-create a new paradigm of AI ecosystem, lastly, with the help of AGI, Honor intends to "open human potential boundaries and co-create a new paradigm for civilization."</p>
<p>The said intelligent phone will be incorporating human-centric AI — primarily built to maximize human potential. Honor also shared its plans to bring the world's first GUI (Graphical User Interface)-based mobile AI agent. The company is also partnering with Google Cloud and Qualcomm Technologies and demonstrated the AI agent in making a table reservation through a third-party service at the keynote.</p><p>Honor has also announced a new imaging technology called AiMAGE. It utilizes an AI Kernel to run device-cloud AI models, aiming to enhance image clarity. The company further plans to integrate more AI features, like AI Upscale for restoring old portraits by partnering with services like Google Cloud. We will be the first to witness it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 </a>series, which is said to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Honor has also shared that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honors-latest-ai-features-want-to-fight-deep-fake-videos-and-eye-strain">Deepfake detection</a> will be arriving on its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> in international markets.</p><p>Honor aims to bring AI to the masses, and as a testament to its commitment, the company has announced that it will be investing over $10 billion over the next five years to fund the endeavor.</p>
<p>“It is clear that the AI revolution will reshape the paradigm of the device industry - completely transforming our productivity, our society, and even our culture more than ever before,” said James Li, CEO of Honor.</p><p>“I am calling on all of us to unite together to address the challenges – as well as the many opportunities – of AI technology. I also call on the industry to be truly open so that we can fully embrace this exciting AI future. Let’s do it together.”</p><p>“As we move into the physical AI era, we need to open our industry boundaries and co-create a new paradigm for the AI ecosystem,” Li further added. He also believes that by working together to maximize their potential, they can aim to create a new paradigm in the AGI era, where carbon-based life and silicon-based intelligence co-exist.</p><p>Lastly, the Alpha plan's emphasis can be witnessed first in Honor's phones starting with the Magic series, as they are now promised seven years of Android OS and security updates, starting with the European region.</p>

<ul><li>Honor announced that it has committed to bringing seven years of Android OS and security updates to its Magic series.</li><li>The press release shows Honor is looking to take “responsibility” as it looks to bring “confidence” to the lifespan of its devices for consumers.</li><li>The company is also prepared to rope its upcoming major AI software into this seven year commitment for users.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>HONOR is making a decisive announcement today (Mar 2) about its newfound commitment toward device sustainability.</p><p>In a press release, HONOR announced that it has committed to bringing seven years of major Android OS updates and security updates to its Magic series. The company explains it made this move for the sake of device sustainability and “responsibility.” According to HONOR, providing seven years of updates is, in its eyes, a “pioneering step” toward reducing e-waste and supporting a more “circular economy.”</p><p>HONOR says that while seven years is a few years higher than the industry’s typically offered three to five years of support, it also aligns with the EU’s regulations. The region’s Circular Economy and Ecodesign regulations are what it’s referencing, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/ecodesign-sustainable-products-regulation_en">the latter focused on</a> reducing climate change and pollution as a result of discarded tech products.</p><p>Of course, extending update support to seven years for Android upgrades and security fixes benefits the consumer. HONOR states it hopes this move will instill “confidence” in its consumers that their Magic series devices will “remain up-to-date, secure, and feature-rich” throughout its lifespan.</p><p>Having an assortment of features not only references pieces of software like MagicOS 9.0 (Android 15), but also the AI tools HONOR has in store.</p><p>Honor is prepared for the “Age of AI” and it plans to ensure its products can walk that journey, too. The post states its seven year commitment to the Magic series regarding updates concerns its AI software, as well. “For years to come,” Honor says its Magic series phones will enjoy “cutting-edge” AI features and “innovative” functions.</p>

<p>There is a lot more that Honor has in store during MWC 2025 in Barcelona. As a teaser, the company states consumers should look forward to its complete Honor ALPHA PLAN, which is a new “strategic vision” regarding its software and how it can work to improve your life.</p><p>Honor states it’s pleased to join the top three global brands globally in delivering seven years of Android and security updates to its users. The company is likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">referring to Samsung</a> and Google, which have both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-pixel-8-update-promise">committed to</a> such a lifespan extension for its phones.</p><p>While we await the rest of Honor’s announcements, the company<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-teases-new-ios-cross-device-features-coming-soon"> briefly teased</a> what its Alpha Plan could be earlier this week. Honor alluded to boosting its AI software with cross-platform integration, meaning it has Apple’s iOS devices in its sights for better compatibility with its own products. The rest of its Alpa Plan seems to concern creating an open, collaborative AI ecosystem through “global partnerships.”</p><p>These partnerships <em>could </em>involve Google’s Gemini model. It’s worth noting that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a> already incorporates the DeepSeek LLM into its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-teams-up-with-gemini-and-chatgpts-biggest-rival-to-level-up-its-ai-assistant">YOYO assistant</a>. We’ll just have to wait and see what MWC 2025 holds for Honor officially when it kicks off on March 3.</p>

<p>The Android Central team reviews dozens of smartwatches, smart rings, wireless earbuds, and other fitness-related accessories every year. But which devices do we <strong>buy for ourselves</strong> or <strong>keep using</strong> after the review ends?</p><p>I asked my Android Central colleagues, both full-time and freelance, to share their fitness insights. I asked which fitness apps they rely on as they switch from Samsung to Garmin to Fitbit — the baseline software that keeps their training on point while juggling different hardware for editorials and reviews. And I asked about their favorite wearable hardware.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, they had trouble picking just one watch or app as their favorite. I also told them to keep it short and sweet, so you can see from these lengthy answers how enthusiastic our team is about fitness tech!</p><p>Below are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> and fitness apps that we prefer when we don't have a deadline, the devices we trust to keep us healthy, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/tech-and-apps-i-used-to-lose-30-pounds">lose weight</a>, or get stronger or faster as an athlete.</p>
<h2 id="brady-snyder-nike-run-club-app-garmin-enduro-3-and-samsung-galaxy-watch-6-classic-2">Brady Snyder: Nike Run Club app, Garmin Enduro 3, and Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</h2>
<p>I’ve used Nike Run Club to run over 1,500 miles across a decade and countless devices. There are a few reasons I’ve stuck by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nike.plusgps&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Nike Run Club</strong></a> over the years, starting with the app’s compatibility. It’s available on the App Store and the Google Play Store, and there are watchOS and Wear OS apps, too. On top of that, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> can automatically sync their run data with the NRC app on your phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Z32MkGAMauCiu5bNV4rQvP" name="nike-run-club-screenshots" alt="Screenshots from the Nike Run Club app showing a run activity, annual running stats, achievements, and challenges" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z32MkGAMauCiu5bNV4rQvP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>NRC handles the basics excellently, with the bright and bold Nike font making your pace, duration, heart rate, and more visible at a glance. It supports media playback controls, and its post-run breakdowns are both data-rich and easy to understand. Like other running apps, NRC is as much a social media app as it is a fitness tracker. Luckily, these features are actually neat, and they prioritize friendly competition with other users (with weekly challenges) and yourself (with awards and milestones) while reminding you to rest. There are also training plans and guided runs, if you’re into that.</p><p>Whether I'm using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">Garmin Enduro 3</a> for battery life and training insights or my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> for better phone integration, I’ve yet to find a running app I like more than Nike Run Club.</p>

<p>I’m not the runner that folks like Brady and Michael Hicks are, but ever since writing an article on VO2 Max and how to increase it, I’ve developed a masochistic joy for running (on the treadmill, mostly). For that article, I received professional advice and some coaching from world-class, elite Olympic coaches, and I’ve been obsessed with cardio training using periodization. In three months, I raised my VO2 Max by five points, which is important for me because exercise is the most impactful medicine I use to combat my Type II diabetes. To that end, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nike.plusgps&hl=en_US"><strong>Nike Run Club</strong></a> has been an indispensable tool for helping me continue progressing and increasing my heart health.</p><p>I generally spend more time “pumping iron” than running or rucking. None of the smartwatches’ companion apps do all the things that my favorite workout journal, the Strong app, does. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.strongapp.strong&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Strong app</strong></a> helps me track historical data, but more importantly, it helps me focus on lifts and the mind/muscle connection by removing the mental load of having to remember my strength training routines for different days (leg day, push/pull, etc.).</p><p>For those days of dynamic, high-intensity workouts or when I’m lying on a flat bench, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review" target="_blank">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2</a> are my “go-to” workout earbuds. They don’t move. They sound great. On days that I choose to hit the heavy bag, I don’t have to worry about a watch not tracking my HR because the HRM in the Powerbeats Pro 2 has been rock solid so far, even keeping up beat-for-beat with my chest strap HRM.</p><p>The numbers on your scale are kaka unless those numbers are your body composition data. BMI is a terrible metric for many people, and your weight can be misleading as you start a workout regimen. That’s because muscle is more dense than fat, and as you put more of it on, it can actually look like your weight is going up! So, my favorite way of measuring physiological progress, which includes muscle gain, and fat loss, is the Withings Body Scan. The price isn’t for casual users, but using your health insurance’s FSA makes it accessible if it’s the kind of tool you need.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PDXSzw9KFA8xDA2TAMqPuS" name="Garmin-Venu-3-muscle-map.jpeg" alt="A muscle map for side lunges on the Garmin Venu 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PDXSzw9KFA8xDA2TAMqPuS.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to tracking my workouts, I often switch between a few devices. However, the one I come back to most often is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a>. It just does everything I need it to, despite its rather cumbersome UI. I’m not much of a runner, which is Garmin’s bread and butter, but the watch tracks weightlifting rather well — at least better than I’ve seen on other smartwatches I’ve used. I like that it actually attempts to count reps, automatically ends sets when it detects certain movements have stopped, and doesn’t need to be charged as often as my other devices.</p><p>What’s also nice about the Garmin app is that it syncs to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strava&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Strava</strong></a>, an app I’ve been using more often over the past several months. It’s a great app/network that lets me share my workouts with others and helps me stay accountable. Strava integrates with many different apps, so it’s easy to share activities from whatever app I use to track a workout, whether it be Garmin Connect, Oura, or Samsung Health. It’s also great because people who follow you can give you kudos whenever you post a workout/activity, which often gives me a little confidence boost.</p>

<p>I've relied on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> (and its two predecessors) for keeping track of my heart rate while working out. I aim to keep BPMs in the 160s when doing more stressful cardio-heavy workouts, so wearing a watch like this is helpful to know when I need to take a small break to cool down. I also love the size and shape, as it's the most comfortable watch I've ever used when lifting barbells or bending my wrist using other equipment. Most smartwatches are just too big for this purpose and cause discomfort.</p><p>My runner-up is the newly launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, which has crazy good GPS tracking and unbelievable 4-6 day battery life. So far, I've found the heart rate monitoring to be on par with the Pixel Watch 3, making it a great alternative for when I forget to charge the Pixel Watch. It's also got substantially better metrics and software, including graphs and data that I find easier to read. While Google requires you to have a Fitbit subscription to get all the Pixel Watch's features, OnePlus gives you everything for free and does all the AI analysis and processing on your phone through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heytap.health.international" target="_blank"><strong>OHealth app</strong></a>.</p><p>Aside from smartwatches, I've also found apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.yuka.android&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Yuka</strong></a> are super helpful for a healthier overall lifestyle. Yuka helps me quickly identify foods at the grocery store that I should avoid by giving me a clear and easy breakdown of all the good and bad stuff in a product. Yuka sports a massive database with information for most foods, making it easy to avoid allergens or additives I don't want to be eating.</p>

<p>Maybe I should take some notes or something, as I think I'm one of the few at Android Central that doesn't actively work out. The only exception to that is chasing around my one-year-old so he doesn't end up getting into things he shouldn't. With that, I've spent the last month or so with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, which I picked up ahead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> launch.</p><p>Two big reasons why I opted for the Ultra over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Watch 7</a> were battery life and durability. As I've mentioned previously, I'm kind of addicted to seeing how much sleep I get every night. Looking at it every morning gives me a pretty good gauge of how the day will go or how late I can work before my brain turns to mush. Because of that, I'm not really one for charging their smartwatch overnight, as I'd prefer to wear it in order to provide more accurate results than relying on my phone.</p><p>Again, since I'm not much for working out, my other favorite app is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.homeassistant.companion.android&hl=en_US"><strong>Home Assistant</strong></a>, although until recently, it was just Google Home. When the little one is finally ready for a nap, trying to turn off the Hue bulbs in his room with Assistant can ruin any hopes of some quiet time. Thankfully, I don't have to worry about that, as I just turn off any lights I need to right from my wrist. And with Home Assistant, it just gives me control over practically all of my smart devices, even if there isn't a Wear OS companion app.</p>

<p>I use a range of devices and apps that I have enjoyed over the years. Ironically, I gave up wearing an Apple Watch about 3 years ago as it really affected my mental health, but then recently got one for Christmas and started using it only during workouts. I have enjoyed it because I am only using it while working out and for monitoring my workouts, which has been great.</p><p>For me, however, my ultimate item has been the Oura Ring. I started with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Gen 3</a> and now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Gen 4</a>. It has dramatically changed the way I look at my body. Some of my favorite features are the detailed information under your Readiness Score and my Sleep Score. I can really monitor what affected both of these categories based on my habits. And I find that overall it really has helped having a much more balanced lifestyle.</p><p>For working out in general, I do a variety of things. I used to go to a spin studio in person a few years ago, and then, over the pandemic, they came up with online classes. I use their video service with the bike I have at home for those, but additionally, I’ve consistently enjoyed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepeloton.callisto&hl=en_US"><strong>Peloton app</strong></a>. It gives so many amazing workout options like kickboxing, running classes, walking classes, yoga, pilates, and HIIT workouts. I’ve genuinely enjoyed figuring out who my favorite instructors are and the type of classes.</p>

<p>I run about 60–70 miles a month, so I need a fitness watch with long battery life, accurate GPS and heart rate, and useful training insights. While brands like COROS and Polar fit that criteria, I keep going back to Garmin watches because of its training load focus metric that tells me if I have enough low aerobic (HR zones 1–2), high aerobic (zones 3–4), and anaerobic (zone 5) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improve my VO2 Max</a>. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/well/move/zone-2-exercise-benefits.html">New York Times article about Zone 2 training</a> confirms the Garmin philosophy that you need a balance of easy and max-effort training to improve, so it doesn't matter if I use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Garmin Forerunner 965</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>; I just need the daily nudge to focus on the zones I've neglected.</p><p>I've used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strava&hl=en_US" target="_blank"><strong>Strava</strong></a> for years after Runtastic became Adidas Running, which drove me to switch. But I mostly used it as a log so I could check my monthly and annual stats, not caring much about its challenges or social elements. I've become more enthusiastic about it since it added and smartened up its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/strava-announces-stable-athlete-intelligence-anti-cheating-and-flyover-sharing">Athlete Intelligence tool</a>. Still, its AI insights and segment leaderboards are mostly novelties for me.</p><p>When it comes to tracking my progress, I'll die on the hill that a fitness app makes things too complicated and is too interested in selling this broad, life-changing experience. All I need is a Google Doc to track my monthly mileage; I keep it open in a Chrome tab at all times so I can look at my goals — both fitness and non-fitness — to motivate me on what I need to do next!</p>

That may have been a bit premature considering I liked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">Vivo X100 Ultra</a> a bit better, but it doesn't take away from the fact that the 14 Ultra continues to be a standout phone. <br><br>Xiaomi isn't changing things too much with the 15 Ultra, which is a good thing. The phone retains a massive 1-inch main camera, and you get a new 200MP tele lens that's outstanding (it uses the same Samsung HP9 imaging sensor as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>). There's a bigger battery that lasts over a day, all the high-res audio codecs you need, and all the extras you'd want in a 2025 flagship. <br><br>I used the Xiaomi 15 Ultra for a month, and that's a rarity in itself — I test most phones for a week or two before writing the review, so I was able to really get a feel for the device this time around. My key takeaway is that the phone has one of the best camera packages of 2025; it does a better job than its predecessor, and the introduction of the 200MP lens at the back means you get cleaner shots at 4x and much better portrait imagery. <br><br>That said, some of the issues that plagued the Xiaomi 14 Ultra are present on the 15 Ultra as well. As good as the cameras are on the phone, they can be inconsistent, particularly when shooting HDR images. Xiaomi addressed this to an extent by rolling out software updates on the 14 Ultra, and it will likely do the same with the 15 Ultra — I'll share an update once that goes live. <br><br>Outside of that and the occasional overheating, I don't have any problems with the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and while I'm waiting to see what OPPO and Vivo do with their Ultra models, the phone sets a high bar for mobile imaging in 2025.</p>

<p>Xiaomi unveiled the Xiaomi 15 Ultra on February 27 in China, with a global launch at Mobile World Congress on March 2. The device will make its way to India, the U.K., and other global markets where Xiaomi has a presence. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra is sold in two storage sizes: 16GB/512GB and 16GB/1TB.</p><p>The 15 Ultra is going on sale globally for €1,499, and this is the configuration that comes with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Xiaomi also has the standard model going on sale, and that model will cost €999 globally.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-xiaomi-15-ultra-design"><span>Xiaomi 15 Ultra: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MQakYKRpp4fnbYTWySVQ87" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MQakYKRpp4fnbYTWySVQ87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After years of constantly switching designs of its phones, Xiaomi finally has a semblance of a unified design language — at least on its Ultra models. The Xiaomi 15 Ultra looks nearly identical to its predecessor, and I how the aluminum mid-frame blends seamlessly into the glass back. You still get flat sides, but like last year, the beveled design where the mid-frame meets the back ensures the device isn't uncomfortable to hold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="htrm9nNRiBwPMFxnqFMDs6" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra profile view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/htrm9nNRiBwPMFxnqFMDs6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming in at 9.4mm, the 15 Ultra is noticeably thicker than most other 2025 phones — Vivo's X200 Pro and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> are just 8.2mm while featuring even bigger batteries. This was the case last year on the 14 Ultra as well, and if anything, I think the thicker profile makes holding the phone a little easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fByetpotnP9YVpgPMZvQr6" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra side view with power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fByetpotnP9YVpgPMZvQr6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, the sides have a matte texture, and they don't pick up any smudges. The beveled design along with rounded edges and matte coating combine to create a great in-hand feel, and even though it's on the heavier end of the scale at 226g, Xiaomi nailed the weight distribution — the 15 Ultra doesn't feel unwieldy in the least.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dAe2gvC6UprPM9oaaXDa27" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dAe2gvC6UprPM9oaaXDa27.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design at the back is dominated by the massive camera island, and it looks a little cleaner than last year (which really isn't saying much). The 200MP tele lens sits at the top next to the Leica branding, with the other three modules located below. There isn't a gold accent encircling the island this time, with Xiaomi instead using the same material as the mid-frame. This makes the design of the camera island look cohesive, and even though it's a sizeable unit (it takes up most of the width at the back), there's no wobble when using the phone on a table.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YGE5qYkhExMhcaYv5ES6B7" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YGE5qYkhExMhcaYv5ES6B7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi did a good job with the design this year, introducing a distinctive two-tone finish with the leather-backed models that make the 15 Ultra look like classic DSLR cameras. I got the white model with a glass back, and while it doesn't have as much design flair, the color option has a swirling pattern underneath the glass that gives it a little elegance, and the texture makes it great to hold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qTQ8PxL8qsExhKzWBGxjq6" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qTQ8PxL8qsExhKzWBGxjq6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside a better design, the 15 Ultra has much better durability. The phone uses Xiaomi's custom glass solution, and it is effective against tumbles. Other than a week of travel where I put the phone in the bundled case (I didn't want to push my luck), I used the 15 Ultra without a case, and it held up incredibly well to the rigors of daily use. In spite of a dozen tumbles in the month I used the phone — two from the dining table — it didn't pick up any visible damage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8kcCF4qD3Cz5FSajha7Ds6" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra bottom view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8kcCF4qD3Cz5FSajha7Ds6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the subject of resilience, the 15 Ultra has IP68 ingress protection, and you shouldn't have any issues using the device in the bath or at the pool. While most 2025 phones have IP69 protection in addition to IP68, the 15 Ultra misses out in that area. Still, it isn't an issue in regular use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5fTSiWCKbuz44QSrkwzBs6" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra camera island" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fTSiWCKbuz44QSrkwzBs6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power and volume buttons are located on the right, and the textured coating on the power button is intact this year. The positioning of the buttons is ideal, as is the fingerprint sensor — it's located at just the right place to unlock the device even while using it one-handed. On that note, Xiaomi switched to an ultrasonic module this year, and while I'm generally not a fan of these sensors — they're unreliable outside of Vivo and iQOO phones — I didn't have any problems on the device. It is fast to authenticate and doesn't have any issues even when you use the phone with wet fingers.</p>
<p>Overall, the 15 Ultra has one of the best-looking designs of the year, and while it is bulkier and heavier than its immediate rivals, Xiaomi did a great job with the in-hand feel, and it is comfortable to hold and use.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6Bq4555qe6SGEtiZ7QobB7" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra home page against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6Bq4555qe6SGEtiZ7QobB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi likes using 6.73-inch AMOLED panels on its Ultra devices, and that's been the case starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-12s-ultra-review">12S Ultra</a> back in 2022. The 15 Ultra retains the same size, but the panel gets a little brighter than last year. It still has 120Hz refresh, and goes up to 3200 nits in HDR content, but it's in outdoor use where the device excels — the AMOLED panel gets bright enough that even under harsh sunlight, there are no issues viewing the screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hKipWAH4pfUo3adzUhMc77" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hKipWAH4pfUo3adzUhMc77.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As always, Xiaomi did a great job calibrating the panel out of the box, and it has vibrant colors and excellent contrast. You have a good amount of customizability when it comes to adjusting the color balance — I used the original colour Pro mode — and you can have the balance change dynamically based on ambient light.</p>
<p>Just like its predecessor, the 15 Ultra handles HDR content really well, delivering saturated colors and good brightness levels. The built-in sound isn't that loud this year — you don't get an identical stereo channel at the top — but it is still decent enough for casual gaming and media playback in general.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZbhkGi5FRmDDCY5qrsuaB7" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra home page against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZbhkGi5FRmDDCY5qrsuaB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone has one of the best reading modes of any device; Xiaomi lets you set up custom colors or switch to a monochrome mode, and you can schedule it to kick in at a particular time or enable it automatically when you open an app. You get an always-on mode as well, and while Xiaomi's always-on styles aren't quite as extensive as what you get in ColorOS, you get a good selection nonetheless. <br><br>The 15 Ultra uses Xiaomi's custom Shield Glass 2.0 solution, and it is effective at safeguarding the panel against tumbles and scratches. I don't see any visible scratches on the panel after a month of use, and it weathered a dozen tumbles with ease.</p>

<p>Xiaomi is no stranger to delivering a great hardware package, and you get Qualcomm's latest silicon under the hood along with 16GB of RAM and either 512GB or 1TB of the latest UFS 4.1 storage. I'm using the 16GB/512GB model, and I didn't run into any issues in daily use; there's no lag whatsoever, and Xiaomi did a good job optimizing the software. <br><br>The 15 Ultra has much better fluidity than its predecessor, and it makes using the device fun. It handles gaming with relative ease as well, and I got reliable framerates in demanding titles without any noticeable jitter or lag. While Xiaomi is using a bigger vapor chamber this year, overheating continues to be a problem on the 15 Ultra; the device gets hotter than the X200 Pro, and it has the same issues as the Qualcomm-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>.</p>

<p>In fact, the phone got so hot that I wasn't able to run 3DMark's Steel Nomad stress test; the synthetic workload was abandoned at the halfway point, with a message saying the device overheated. This was an issue on last year's 14 Ultra as well, and it's clear that Xiaomi needs to tweak its thermal management. While overheating is a problem in demanding titles, the device didn't exit a game mid-way — that was only during a 3DMark run — and there isn't excessive throttling. <br><br>The rest of the hardware is outstanding; I didn't see any issues with cellular or network connectivity, and calls went through without any problems. The phone gets LHDC in addition to Qualcomm's AptX Adaptive and AptX HD codecs, and it even has Bluetooth 6.0. <br><br>The vibration motor is among the best around, and it delivers granular feedback while using the keyboard or navigating the interface. Qualcomm-based phones in general tend to run hotter than the Dimensity 9400-powered Find X8 Pro and Vivo X200 Pro, and that's true of the 15 Ultra as well; that said, it still does a fantastic job at gaming.</p>

<p>Xiaomi boosted the battery on the 15 Ultra, with the device now featuring a 5410mAh unit. As a result, it lasts considerably longer than its predecessor, and I didn't have to worry about battery anxiety even while traveling. It isn't as good as the X200 Pro in this regard — I'm beginning to think that no device can measure up to Vivo's offering in 2025 — but it does a great job in its own right, and I only had to charge the device every day and a half on average. <br><br>Like its Chinese rivals, the 15 Ultra uses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbide battery</a> to great effect, and you get better density and longevity. Xiaomi didn't change the charging tech, so the phone has the same 90W fast charging over USB PD as last year, and it even goes up to 80W wirelessly, but I wasn't able to test this particular mode as Xiaomi still doesn't sell the requisite charger outside China. <br><br>You get the usual safeguards, including optimized charging and an 80% charging limit, and it takes just over 50 minutes to charge the unit from flat. Even with heavy use involving several house of navigation and gaming, the phone lasted a day without breaking a sweat, and while it may not be the longest-lasting phone I used in 2025, it comes close.</p>

<p>Xiaomi continues to deliver an outstanding camera package with the 15 Ultra, and at the heart of the imaging system is the 1-inch Sony LYT-900 module. It isn't a variable lens this time and is locked to f/1.63, and it retains OIS. The sensor is similar to what Xiaomi used to great effect last year, and honestly, I'm glad the brand didn't change anything in this area. <br><br>A key differentiator this year is the debut of the 200MP Samsung HP9 module that handles telephoto duties up to 4.3x and beyond, and it is without a doubt the best sensor in this category — Vivo's X200 Pro has the same lens. It's joined by a 50MP Sony IMX858 tele lens, and a 50MP Samsung JN5 wide-angle module. Both tele shooters get OIS as standard, and up front there's a 32MP camera with autofocus. <br><br>The camera interface is unchanged, so I'm not going to talk about it too much. Like last year, you get the ability to shoot 4K60 via all the rear cameras, and the ability to do so from 0.6x to 4.3x is pretty great. You even get 4K120 with the main camera and 200MP lens, and it is a unique advantage that you don't get with any other phone. <br><br>Xiaomi is once again leveraging Leica optics and tuning, and you get two shooting profiles: Leica Authentic and Vibrant. The Authentic mode has a slight vignette and renders accurate details, but I like the tonal balance of the Vibrant mode, so that's what I used.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, the 15 Ultra takes amazing photos in daylight situations. There's good color balance and dynamic range, and there are no issues with foliage rendition or white balance. Colors aren't too saturated either, but you get a good vibrancy that makes the image stand out when sharing on social media.</p>

<p>The wide-angle lens does a great job, and it manages to take detailed shots even in low-light situations. You get a similar color balance as the main camera, and I didn't have any issues taking wide-angle shots. <br><br>A big part of what makes the 15 Ultra great is its ability to take wonderful telephoto shots. The inclusion of two lenses means you get a 3x mode at 70mm focal length and 4.3x at 100mm focal length, with the phone relying on in-sensor zoom via the main camera to deliver 2x shots. Shots at 3x and 4.3x have excellent rendition and detail, and the device manages to take the same caliber of photos in low-light situations as well.</p>

<p>Another bonus is that you get good versatility when it comes to portrait imagery. This is where the Vivo X200 Pro comes into its own, and while the 15 Ultra takes detailed shots, there are issues. I noticed instances where it struggled with background segmentation and dialing in on the subject. <br><br>In the photo above of my colleague Derrek Lee, it took several tries to get a natural background blur without any artifacts, and even then it didn't retain focus on the phones held in his hands. This isn't an issue on the X200 Pro or Find X8 Pro, so Xiaomi needs to dial in some of the problems with portraits.</p>

<p>There are inconsistencies with HDR, with noticeable blooming at times. These problems should be straightforward to address with software updates, and I'll revisit this section in a month to see if the issues are sorted out. Clearly, the hardware is among the best of any phone available today, and Xiaomi just needs to dial in the tuning a little bit to make the device reach its potential.<br><br>Don't get me wrong; the 15 Ultra delivers terrific photos in just about any scenario — it's just that having used the X100 Ultra and the X200 Pro, I know what the underlying hardware is able to achieve. But even as things stand, the 15 Ultra does enough to measure up against the X200 Pro, and it easily outshines the Galaxy S25 Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-xiaomi-15-ultra-software"><span>Xiaomi 15 Ultra: Software</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cmwyZWWPWKGBQQXjjJVNC7" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra Android 15 Easter egg" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cmwyZWWPWKGBQQXjjJVNC7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Xiaomi 15 Ultra comes with the latest iteration of the brand's software, and it is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. While there isn't any visual difference, the UI has much better optimization, and this is immediately evident when using the phone. <br><br>As is the case with every new Xiaomi phone, the software has its share of quirks. I got notification alerts even after enabling DND, so I had to manually decrease notification volume to not get constantly distracted by the device. Push notifications haven't been an issue (thankfully), but Xiaomi still doesn't do a good job with floating notifications, and I had to routinely pull down the shade to see incoming one-time codes and messages.</p>
<p>Like all other phone brands, Xiaomi is baking AI features into its software, and that includes the usual image editing tools like object eraser and the ability to remove reflections in photos. Both features are decent in their own right, but I still think ColorOS has the edge in this regard. The only AI-backed utility that I like is the built-in transcribing feature in the Recorder. It did a good job transcribing audio on the fly, and I intend to use it extensively at MWC. <br><br>Other than that, there isn't much else to talk about with the software. Xiaomi is clearly in need of an overhaul, and while you get a decent amount of customizability, the UI as a whole doesn't look as clean as ColorOS or even Funtouch OS. <br><br>When it comes to updates, the 15 Ultra will get four guaranteed Android OS updates alongside five years of security updates, and that's in line with what Xiaomi delivers on all of its high-end phones. Xiaomi at at the bottom of the list when it comes to rolling out platform updates, and that's something the brand needs to address.</p>

<p>I still think Vivo is doing a better job when it comes to tuning the cameras on its devices, and while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> doesn't have a 1-inch sensor, it manages to take fantastic photos and videos. It has the same 200MP tele lens, and I got outstanding portrait shots with the device — so much so that I used it instead of my mirrorless. I'm interesting in seeing what Vivo is able to deliver this year with the X200 Ultra, but outside of that device, I don't think there's anything else that has the ability to go up against the Xiaomi 15 Ultra's camera might. <br><br>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> is a good alternative to consider, and unlike the X200 Pro, it is available in the U.K. and other western markets. It has a clean design, a vibrant AMOLED, great battery life, and the quartet of 50MP cameras at the back takes excellent photos and videos. <br><br>In a similar vein, Honor's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a> combines great cameras with high-end internals. Honor leads the industry with its eye-comfort tech, and while the cameras on the device aren't quite as good as the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, they have clear advantages when shooting photos of moving objects and AI-assisted rendering.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-xiaomi-15-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>Xiaomi 15 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2gXUs4P77BsqjcoXKbEmC7" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2gXUs4P77BsqjcoXKbEmC7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the latest internals and good gaming potential</li><li>You need one of the best camera packages around</li><li>You want reliable battery life and fast charging</li><li>You need a phone with a standout design</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want timely software updates and a clean UI</li><li>You want a phone that doesn't heat up too much</li></ul>
<p>The 15 Ultra solidifies Xiaomi's position in the flagship category. The phone doesn't differ too much to its predecessor, but you get a brighter AMOLED panel, better-looking design that's easier to hold and use, and a bigger battery that lasts a day and a half. <br><br>The phone includes a year's worth of tuning upgrades on the camera side of things, and the difference is evident. The introduction of a 200MP tele lens gives it a distinct advantage, and it takes much better portrait shots than last year's model. Image quality is inconsistent at times, and this was an issue on the 14 Ultra as well — that's one of the reasons why I prefer Vivo's tuning these days. Having said that, the 15 Ultra has one of the strongest camera packages, and it takes outstanding photos and videos most of the time. <br><br>Like previous years, Xiaomi's software is the only real limitation on the device; the brand needs to do a better job cleaning up the interface, and deliver new features. Xiaomi has shown that it can optimize its phones just as well as its Chinese rivals, and it now needs to prove that it can do the same with a visual redesign. <br><br>Overall though, the 15 Ultra has been a delight to use. I could have written this review after using the device for just a week, and in spite of its software foibles, I enjoyed using the 15 Ultra so much that I stuck with it throughout the month. The only other phone that impressed me as much this year was the X200 Pro, and just like Vivo's flagship, Xiaomi did a standout job with the 15 Ultra, and it is among my favorite phones of 2025.</p>
