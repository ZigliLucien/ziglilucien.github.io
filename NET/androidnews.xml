                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>Google's Live Search integrates real-time AI conversations for enhanced user interaction</li><li>Users can now share camera feeds to receive instant answers and insights</li><li>Available on Android and iOS since September 24, bringing versatile assistance to users</li></ul><p>Google announced that it's bringing Project Astra's capabilities to Google Search, helping users get real-time answers via Live Search within AI Mode. Think of it as an upgrade to the current Google Lens, and Google's way of pushing Gemini's multimodal capabilities onto more platforms.</p><p>With "Live Search," users can have real-time, interactive conversations with Google Search in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://search.google/ways-to-search/ai-mode/" target="_blank">AI Mode</a>, much like speaking to the AI chatbot on Gemini Live. This feature allows users to share their phone's camera feed, and they will have the ability to respond to your questions in real time. Since this feature is tied to AI Mode, it will also provide links for intensive research as well.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5oa-TzWXE8k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>For instance, you'd like to know how you can make a cup of matcha — all users have to do is open the Google app (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en_US&pli=1" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942" target="_blank">iOS</a>) and tap the new "Live" icon under the search bar. Then point the camera at the equipment in your matcha set and ask what each tool is used for. Or you could even ask it questions for a deeper understanding of matcha's history or its rise to fame as a beverage.</p><p>It can also come in handy when you're on vacation and want to have a hands-free conversation with someone about the best spots around the neighborhood to explore. Users can even use the Live option on the go to help them translate or give them more information on anything they see. It's practically a personal assistant in your pocket that can help you with quick fixes or if you need help with an assignment.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5dH2iqt0wY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google says that users can start asking questions out loud and enable video input to share visual context from their camera feed. This feature extends into  Google Lens as well. Now, you can go a step further and click on the Live option within Lens to have an instant back-and-forth conversation about whatever you see in front of you, instead of clicking a picture and waiting for Google Lens to do its job.</p><p>The Live Search option is available to all Android and iOS users in the U.S. starting Sept. 24. Accessing this feature appears significantly easier within the Google app itself, as opposed to navigating to Gemini, then selecting Gemini Live, and finally activating your camera.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Beginning this week, once you've downloaded the patch, users receiving messages in another language can long-press that text and tap the new "Translate" button. WhatsApp states users will have to choose the language  the message should be translated "from or to, and download it to be saved for future translations."</p><p>The post stresses the privacy side of WhatsApp, informing users that whatever is translated is done on your device, adding that the service "cannot see them."</p><p>Once this patch hits Android, WhatsApp says those users can enable automatic translations for an entire chat, so everything is converted without your manual input. More importantly, this update brings translation support to Android for six languages: English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, and Arabic. Those on iPhone will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#translate-translate-app">receive support</a> for over 19 languages to start.</p><p>As this update makes its rounds, WhatsApp states you can activate message translation in one-on-one chats, groups, and Channel updates.</p><h2 id="whatsapp-rolls-on-2">WhatsApp rolls on</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3MLW4pP4msh72zT9ah2AGi" name="WhatsApp-logo.jpg" alt="WhatsApp logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MLW4pP4msh72zT9ah2AGi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There have been some notable WhatsApp updates so far, as during the summer, the platform <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/whatsapp-unread-texts-message-summaries-meta-ai-rollout">rolled out message summaries</a>. The feature took Meta AI into heavy consideration in private chats, giving users a noticeable banner when entering a chat after many texts were sent. This banner will quickly summarize what happened, neatly in a bulleted list, so you can catch up.</p><p>Once again, the platform stresses that the contents Meta AI has summarized for you in that private chat remain private to you.</p><p>Another update, erring on the side of caution, rolled out in August for WhatsApp users looking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/whatsapp-is-cracking-down-on-scams-with-new-safety-features">avoid shady and sketchy users</a>.

WhatsApp said that if someone you don't know randomly adds you to a group chat, you'll see a preview of who made it and how many people are in it before making your decision.</p><p>In private chats, WhatsApp is testing alerts to give you all the info you need to know before engaging.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The switch to a fully-custom design — made possible with the Nuvia acquisition — gave Qualcomm a distinct advantage, and it's making effective use of that this year.</p><p>Awkward naming aside, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 delivers considerable upgrades to last year, with Qualcomm touting a huge 20% increase in CPU performance, while somehow simultaneously hitting 35% better efficiency. It's clear that Qualcomm set out to establish itself as the dominant chip vendor with the introduction of the platform, and early benchmarking tests indicate just how much of a lead the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 has this year over devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> models.</p><p>My colleague Derrek Lee is at the annual Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii, and he was able to use a Qualcomm reference device powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 to run synthetic benchmarks.</p><h2 id="snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-domineering-cpu-performance-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5: Domineering CPU performance</h2><p>Let's start with Geekbench; the utility does a good job emulating real-world usage scenarios, and it's a decent predictor of how fast a chipset is. Qualcomm and MediaTek always did well in this area when they used standard Arm cores, but Apple came in and took the overall lead by leveraging a custom design. That's why A series silicon dominated Geekbench charts for the better part of the last six years.</p><p>With the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, Qualcomm is once again asserting its dominance. The chipset managed to get 12,170 in Geekbench's multi-core tests, and that's wild — that's at least 15% better than anything else available today. Even the latest A19 Pro silicon only goes up to 10,500, signaling the gulf that exists between Qualcomm and the rest of the field.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Qualcomm reference device</p></th><th  ><p>Redmagic 10S Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X200 Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Geekbench 6 (single-core)</p></td><td  ><p>3,832</p></td><td  ><p>3,133</p></td><td  ><p>2381</p></td><td  ><p>2288</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Geekbench 6 (multi-core)</p></td><td  ><p>12,170</p></td><td  ><p>9,479</p></td><td  ><p>7175</p></td><td  ><p>6030</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It's a similar story with single-core results as well. With a result of 3,832 in Geekbench 6, Qualcomm is showing that it's able to hold onto the lead in this category. Qualcomm isn't going into too much detail about the internals of the Oryon cores and the underlying architecture, but seeing as how it underpins the chip vendor's computing efforts — both on mobile and PC — it's evident just how much of an impact a custom design has. That's not a new thing; Apple has shown time and again that it's able to deliver in this area, both with the A series silicon and its M range of chipsets that it uses on MacBooks and iPads.</p><p>With Qualcomm doubling down on its custom design, it has an outsized lead in the context of Android phones. MediaTek's Dimensity, Google Tensor, and Samsung Exynos all use regular Arm cores, and while they're great in their own right — I'm excited to see what Arm's C1 Ultra and C1 Pro manage to offer with the Dimensity 9400 — but it's likely that the gains won't be as high as what Qualcomm is delivering this year.</p><h2 id="snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-adreno-blazes-ahead-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5: Adreno blazes ahead</h2><p>Qualcomm is making decent inroads with the Adreno GPU as well, touting 23% improved performance alongside 20%better efficiency. We usually see these kinds of gains when a chip vendor moves to a new node, but Qualcomm is using the same 3nm TSMC node as last year, making the improvements all the more impressive.</p><p>Another interesting highlight is that Qualcomm now offers Unreal Engine 5 integration with its mobile chipset, making it easier to get console-quality games on Android. This has been an area where Apple had a distinct advantage thanks to its vertical integration, and Qualcomm is aiming to address that. We'll have to wait and see if it leads to any meaningful change when it comes to Android gaming — I'm yet to play a decent title with ray tracing — but Qualcomm is putting in the legwork.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Qualcomm reference device</p></th><th  ><p>Redmagic 10S Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X200 Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (score)</p></td><td  ><p>8,393</p></td><td  ><p>6,954</p></td><td  ><p>6,070</p></td><td  ><p>3,182</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>50.26</p></td><td  ><p>41.64</p></td><td  ><p>36.35</p></td><td  ><p>19.05</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>3DMark's Wild Like Extreme showcases the gains on offer this year. While these benchmarks aren't indicative of real-world use, they allow us to see how much things change year-on-year, and the results showcase the potential of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. We are coming to a point where it isn't the hardware, but the quality of the games that's the bottleneck on Android.</p><p>I'm excited to get my hands on devices powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. Phone manufacturers don't tend to wait too long before releasing devices, with Xiaomi, Realme, and Honor slated to roll out phones featuring Qualcomm's latest silicon in the coming weeks. With the Dimensity 9500-powered OPPO Find X9 Pro also debuting globally soon, we don't have to wait too long to see how Qualcomm and MediaTek's chipsets hold up in real-world scenarios. Until then, Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 benchmarks suggest next year's flagships should be highly interesting.</p> ]]></dc:content>

All price hikes are said to go into effect on October 21. Both of the standalone Disney Plus plans are going up, moving from $9.99 to $11.99 for its basic with ads plans and $15.99 to $18.99 for its Premium (no ads) version.</p><p>When we get to the Disney Plus, Hulu, HBO Max bundles, those are set to go up, too. The support page states that the bundle with ads, currently for $16.99 a month, will rise to $19.99 per month on October 21. This hike extends to the no-ads version, going from $29.99 per month to $32.99.</p><p>The final major bundle, the one with Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN, isn't getting a price hike <em>everywhere</em>, but there are still changes consumers should know.

The post highlights Marisa Kaba (journalist) on Bluesky, who had an alleged inside scoop about this, and it seems the recent removal of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, which has since returned to ABC, caused the service to drop subscribers at an incredible rate. Moreover, Kaba reports that Disney and ABC moved to quickly bring the late-night show back because of this planned price hike.</p><p>Kaba adds, "With subscriptions hemorrhaging since last week, they couldn’t risk losing more users with this announcement."</p><p>Unfortunately, this isn't the first time Disney Plus subscribers have gone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-disney-plus-price-increase-goes-into-effect-this-week-heres-how-to-keep-your-current-rate">through this price hike scenario</a>, and it's all feeling like a time loop by this point. The service raised prices in December 2022 for its Premium plans, Legacy bundles, and other Hulu, ESPN bundles. Fast-forward to 2023 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-hulu-are-raising-prices-again">the service raised prices</a>—again—for its bundles and other ad-free plans.</p><p>The only thing consistent, other than the fact that the past few years have had price hikes, is that Disney tends to do them late in the year, between October and December. While these hikes have been confirmed on its support page, the service is sure to begin emailing users or informing you in the app about how the hikes will affect your specific plan.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It just has a very limited user base.</p><p>Regardless of what device manufacturers try to tell you, professional, commercial-grade video is not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-video-recording-upgrade">taken by people using a phone</a>. You may find a few clips mixed into something that <em>are</em> phone video, but a "cheap" device like even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best phone</a> simply can't compare to a proper video camera. A codec doesn't change or dictate that. Physics does.</p><p>Having said that, most of us know "that guy." You might even be that guy — the person who makes taking videos with his or her phone more than a hobby and really geeks out over it all. This is for that guy, and it's an awesome feature.</p><p>Now we don't know how this works in real life just yet, and I'm going to assume everything will go as planned, and using APV won't make phones overheat or kill a battery in 12 minutes. You know, the optimistic route.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SPZiqduU9qWPUXB9Jcd65n" name="Snapdragon-logo-water" alt="The Snapdragon logo sitting above water in a pool next to the ocean in Maui" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SPZiqduU9qWPUXB9Jcd65n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The "prosumer" phone camera enthusiast knows they won't see a world of difference visually. This doesn't change how the video looks, per se, just how efficiently it can be captured and worked with later. For that, this should be a treat, and the end result may very well look better because of it.</p><p>Videos captured should be able to retain more information, which means the editing software has more data to work with. A video editing app is like Google or Amazon and loves having a mountain of data to sort through. An efficient, "lossless", high-bandwidth capture codec means the editing process can spend more time on tweaking the visuals and have more picture information to use while doing it.</p><p>This will make a difference, but only if you're "that guy" and know how and why you want to use it.</p><p>So far, APV support is limited to only Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 (my god these names) powered devices. More information about phones sporting the latest chip will be coming, and it's possible that support will carry down to Qualcomm's more mid-range Snapdragon chips sometime in the future.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Despite having many cool, affordable, and customizable Android smartwatches available, iPhone owners have been largely limited to Apple Watches, as other brands have struggled to match the same level of compatibility. But that could be changing soon.</p><p>Apple seems to be making these changes under the hood, as a recent deep dive into iOS 26.1's beta code, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2917201/ios-26-1-beta-suggests-the-iphone-will-soon-support-third-party-smartwatches.html">Macworld</a> appears to have spotted notification support for third-party smartwatches. The website noted that the latest iOS beta code showed up with an unreleased "Notification Forwarding" feature, which allows iPhone users to pick a third-party device/ accessory other than the iPhone to show their notifications on.</p><p>But here's the catch: within the strings of the code, there's a restriction on this feature that suggests that notifications can only be forwarded to “one accessory at a time,” which means that you'd have to disable notifications on your Apple Watch in case you want to see them on your third-party accessory, which is what most people would do if they own two watches.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fMN3H8jBZ2phCEXWxyMuuN" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMN3H8jBZ2phCEXWxyMuuN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The website adds that the beta has references to new abilities concerning accessory pairing, including one called “AccessoryExtension.” This again hints at third-party device pairing, which seems to be in the initial stages of development.</p><p>That said, there's little to no information on whether this feature would roll out globally or would be restricted to certain regions. However, it is highly likely that this feature could come to the EU region first, considering the DMA (Digital Markets Act) basically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/eu-dma-ruling-could-completely-reshape-fitness-smartwatch-industry">forced Apple</a> to make exclusive Apple Watch features available on third-party watches. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202512/DMA_100203_1536.pdf" target="_blank">DMA decision on March 19</a> lists out how Apple must provide "effective interoperability" to let any connected device "receive, access, use, respond to, and transmit iOS notifications as well as to select and manage which notifications are displayed."</p><p>Apple's upcoming iOS update, expected in October, will likely introduce this feature that extends basic notification support to all third-party smartwatches — including devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Samsung's Galaxy Watch</a> and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> out there, but it may not work as seamlessly as an Apple Watch would with an iPhone. So that's still a bargain that users should be willing to make.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d9b17cd0-9cab-415f-84d3-adeb33293d89">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EsJNwXE22phiafcE9ZTFKA.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Bold swing</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic offers Watch 6 Classic owners a faster, efficient Exynos processor, new health sensors with perks like Antioxidant Index and Vascular Load, dual-band GPS, doubled storage, and a blazing 3,000 nits of brightness.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The update places Fitbit, Personal Safety, Gemini, and Google Wallet right above your device's illustration.</p><p>Beneath that illustration, users will find their connectivity info, battery percentage, and the last time the watch has synced with Fitbit's services.</p><p>The clean containers for UI elements that Google has implemented across Android are present in the updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-app-play-store">Pixel Watch app</a>, too. As part of the "main" feature set, users will find Watch Faces and Tiles before scrolling down into their Settings. These new containers and subtle line separators are present throughout the entire app, as well, especially when scrolling through your tiles and other sub-menus.</p><p>The Pixel Watch app icon has been updated in this update (don't be alarmed). The publication notes that users will find a more pronounced Pixel Watch illustration that's a blue, purple mix, as Google moves away from its classic four-color getup.</p><h2 id="m3-expressive-finally-hits-the-main-app-2">M3 Expressive finally hits the main app</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:258px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:232.56%;"><img id="ghgNgRhp8uStSgH954CbiD" name="google-pixel-watch-app-m3-expressive-redesign-update" alt="The M3 Expressive update for the Pixel Watch app changes the game, revamping the main view with softer, rounded icons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ghgNgRhp8uStSgH954CbiD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="258" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:603px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.50%;"><img id="gxzZAattCsj6UNEQtTuYiD" name="google-pixel-watch-app-icon-m3-expressive-update" alt="The M3 Expressive design update for the Pixel Watch app updated its icon, taking it from the classic four-color mix to a blue, purple mashup." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gxzZAattCsj6UNEQtTuYiD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="603" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The post states the update has started rolling out today (Sep 24) via the Play Store.

M3 Expressive delivered a bold redesign to watches, offering new visuals and much smoother animations across the board. One major note to mention is that M3 Expressive hugs those circular curves on the Pixel Watch, making the experience seem fuller and more immersive everywhere you go.</p><p>Aside from the new design, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> was just a massive upgrade over the previous iteration.

People who suffer from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>, for instance, may have an issue with the display, and the phone lacks any Qi2 charging support. Charging speeds are also nothing to write home about, as the Galaxy S25 Ultra is still stuck with 45W wired charging.</p><p>With that said, the Galaxy S25 Ultra's biggest problem continues to be its price. Deals like the Samsung offer above can lessen the blow, but you're still going to be shelling out a good bit of cash if you can't land the max trade-in credit. Will the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-amazon-prime-day-big-deal-days-faq-2025">Big Deal Days sale event</a> (October 7th-8th) finally present a straight Samsung discount worth writing about?

While these phones started out as mid-range devices, that is no longer the case in 2025, with the Xiaomi 15T and 15T Pro inching closer to flagships than traditional mid-range phones.</p><p>The upside is that Xiaomi now offers an all-round package; the 15T Pro has a sleek design that I prefer to the Xiaomi 15 and its rivals like the Vivo X200, the phone has cameras that are just as good in most situations, and the large battery ensures it lasts a day without breaking a sweat. It doesn't miss out on ingress protection either, and it even gets Xiaomi's 50W wireless charging tech in addition to regular 90W charging.</p><p>Essentially, the 15T Pro is the phone you buy if you don't need the absolute best cameras and want to save a few hundred dollars. The only drawback is that the phone doesn't have Android 16 out of the box, and Xiaomi is obstinate about not changing long-standing issues with the software. Still, if you don't mind the older software and want something that doesn't cost as much as true flagships, the 15T Pro has plenty to like.</p><h2 id="xiaomi-15t-pro-pricing-and-availability-2">Xiaomi 15T Pro: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mwSgWgweTWLxn2eXNWvkxA" name="Xiaomi 15T Pro" alt="Xiaomi 15T Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mwSgWgweTWLxn2eXNWvkxA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xiaomi unveiled the 15T and 15T Pro globally at a launch event in Munich on September 24, and both phones are going on sale in the coming weeks.

The front contains the same module as last time, a 32MP Samsung KD1 sensor.</p><p>There isn't much to talk about when it comes to the interface; Xiaomi cleaned up the viewfinder a little, but it is in line with what you get on most other phones, with shooting modes at the bottom, toggles around the interface, and easily-accessible settings. Xiaomi continues to limit 4K60 video to the main and tele lenses, and the wide-angle misses out. That said, video quality is better than previous years.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div

Overall, this isn't a camera that can take on the Xiaomi 15 or Vivo X200, but it holds its own well against other devices in the same category, and that's all that matters.</p><h2 id="xiaomi-15t-pro-same-old-software-issues-2">Xiaomi 15T Pro: Same old software issues</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5161px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kLA2GRcHf3yzJo6BXkrqvA" name="Xiaomi 15T Pro" alt="Xiaomi 15T Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kLA2GRcHf3yzJo6BXkrqvA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5161" height="2907" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xiaomi needs to address its software situation; although the brand embarked on a redesign effort two years ago, the interface continues to be largely unchanged, and there are vestiges of MIUI that make it not as cohesive as other Chinese skins. But what's particularly annoying is that Xiaomi still doesn't offer Android 16 out of the box; both the 15T and 15T Pro run Android 15 as standard, and there's no telling when either device will switch to the latest version of Android.</p><p>To put this into context, Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 launched three months ago with Android 16 out of the box. Yes, that is a significantly costlier device, but Android 16 has been available for over a quarter now, and not including it out of the box is nothing short of negligence. While I've largely enjoyed what Xiaomi is doing with the hardware and cameras on its phones, its software is among the worst of any Android brand, and there's a feeling that Xiaomi doesn't want to change that.</p><p>As a result, you're once again left with an older version of Android on a brand-new device, and the interface should be familiar if you've used a Xiaomi phone in the past. It is fluid and doesn't have much in the way of issues, but it just isn't exciting to use; Xiaomi has to do a better job in this area, because it's not only behind Google and Samsung, but also OPPO and Vivo.</p><h2 id="xiaomi-15t-pro-the-alternatives-2">Xiaomi 15T Pro: The alternatives</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z8HbCAz4dXgnQR3uQFhnma" name="iqoo-13-16.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z8HbCAz4dXgnQR3uQFhnma.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 is a good alternative to the 15T Pro, and while it doesn't quite have versatile cameras, that's about the only major downside. Google did a good job with its phones this year, and the Pixel 10 delivers fantastic software, a great camera, and good internals that aren't as hobbled as previous generations.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 gets a recommendation as well now that it's discounted. It is a terrific all-round package, and it doesn't have much in the way of shortcomings. I also like the iQOO 13; that's another device that does a good job with the basics, and you get decent cameras this year.</p><h2 id="xiaomi-15t-pro-should-you-buy-it-2">Xiaomi 15T Pro: Should you buy it?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5624px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mWAghMY8SFTishyy4MtmpB" name="Xiaomi 15T Pro" alt="Xiaomi 15T Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mWAghMY8SFTishyy4MtmpB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5624" height="3168" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, Xiaomi did enough with the 15T Pro to merit a recommendation. I like the changes to the design, and the cameras are an upgrade — the phone clearly holds its own in this area. The bigger panel is great to use, the internals are among the best around, and the battery life is solid.</p><p>The only problem is around the software; Xiaomi's reluctance to address these issues and continue rolling out phones with older versions of Android is becoming a real issue. In a sense, Xiaomi is like Honor in this regard, with both brands refusing to acknowledge lingering issues with their software. Meanwhile, OPPO and Vivo are doing a great job introducing new features and modernizing their skins, and I can't help but feel that Xiaomi is being left behind.</p><p>If you're willing to overlook the fact that the 15T Pro doesn't have the latest version of Android, then you should get it — the hardware is among the best in its category.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are two major updates Google is reportedly testing, one of which involves a more smartphone-friendly (one-handed) rework. According to the publication, this rework involves the Docs app's formatting tool. Google has been spotted moving this tool down to the bottom of the app's UI, in the toolbar that typically houses the bold, italics, bullet point, and other options.</p><p>The post even highlights an alert that Google could deliver once this update arrives, which draws attention to the formatting tool's new home.</p><p>The bottom bar is also getting a small, but useful, change. In conjunction with the tipster AssembleDebug, the post states that the toolbar at the bottom of a Doc on Android could be "horizontally scrollable."</p><p>Another more noteworthy update spotted in testing concerns new filters in Docs for Android. These filters can be applied to searches in the app, and include filters for file type, people (file owner), and modified (when it was last changed).

This is a step up from basic text-to-speech, and it borrows heavily from Google’s NotebookLM and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> projects, where Audio Overviews first appeared before making their way into Chrome.</p><p>To give it a try (assuming your device has it), open any webpage you’d like summarized, tap the three-dot menu, and select “Listen to this page.” In the playback controls, you’ll now see an option to switch to the Audio Overview mode instead of the standard read-aloud.</p><p>It’s built to be way more interesting than a flat, monotone voice droning through a webpage.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.11%;"><img id="n8nqCznvxbDWcMgK89qHWh" name="Chrome-on-Android-Audio-Overviews" alt="Audio Overviews generating AI playback on Chrome for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n8nqCznvxbDWcMgK89qHWh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="389" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.11%;"><img id="5iySHJ3GknaAyMEav8GWUh" name="Chrome-on-Android-Audio-Overviews" alt="Audio Overviews generating AI playback on Chrome for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5iySHJ3GknaAyMEav8GWUh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="389" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The feature is rolling out in stages, so even with the right version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a>, you might not see it right away.

Shorter pieces work fine with the standard read-aloud, but the conversational style is ideal when you’re busy or just want to give your eyes a break.</p><p>Beyond convenience, Google’s rollout of Audio Overviews to Chrome is a reminder that the web doesn’t have to be a wall of text. By turning articles into audio, it’s helping out folks with visual impairments and anyone who’d rather listen on the go or just can’t be bothered to read another endless scroll.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The imagery shows off the alleged phone from the side, with glimpses at its display and camera array. The leak suggests the Edge 70 will sport a flat display with rounded corners, a design choice that's become commonplace in the industry.</p><p>The image is also pushing the idea that the phone will be thin, stating, "impossibly thin and incredibly tough."</p><p>When we get to the rear panel, the camera array is slightly different from what we've seen Motorola provide this year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-vs-edge-2024">Moto Edge 2025 (Edge 60)</a> and even the Edge 2024 (Edge 50). Instead of being nestled against the top left corner, the camera array takes space a little further into the back panel, leaving space between it and the side. It seems the Edge 70 could sport three cameras on its slightly raised array.</p><p>Additionally, Motorola could have some colored accents inbound for the phone. The alleged promo material shows the camera could be raised off the array, kind of like what you'd <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra">find with Samsung</a>. Those raised lenses could have colored rings around them.</p><h2 id="the-rumors-have-changed-2">The rumors have... changed?</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Boom. pic.twitter.com/zwX9cYJyNp<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1970146975820796289">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>We started hearing about Motorola's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-edge-70-leaks-reveal-familiar-design-and-potential-specs">next Edge series model</a> back in May. Back then, the rumors were different, as posts claimed the device would remain similar to what we've seen this year with the Edge 60 and with the Edge 50 in 2024. Rumors claimed Motorola was sticking to its curved-edge display and a camera system positioned in the corner on the back of the phone.</p><p>The alleged renderings back then pointed toward as much, while also showing off lenses that were flush to its array, not lifted like we've seen rumored today.</p><p>It's difficult to tell which way we're going, especially since rumors now conflict. As far as launch goes, nothing's really certain. Older rumors claimed we would see it this month, perhaps around September 24. That's only a day away, and Motorola hasn't exactly hyped up a new Edge recently. So, we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>There were a few more rumors mentioned in those older leaks, such as the Edge 70 may rock <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7200-launch">MediaTek's Dimensity 7000 SoC</a> and 12GB of RAM. The Edge's predecessor featured a 50MP primary, a 10MP telephoto, and a 50MP ultrawide lens, so speculation says we could see something close to this again.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/sharge-shargeek-170-power-bank-review">Sharge 170 power bank</a> has a uniquely aggressive style, and it manages to turn heads whenever I travel with it. The brand branched out into SSD enclosures earlier this year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/sharge-disk-review">Disk</a>, which is basically a housing designed to slot in an M.2 2230 drive.</p><p>The Disk Pro is the natural evolution of that product. The product is an external SSD that doesn't look anything like its rivals; I recently tested the Neil Poulton-designed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/lacie-rugged-ssd4-4tb-ssd-review">LaCie Rugged SSD4</a>, and while that drive stands out because of the vibrant silicone shell, the Disk Pro is in an entirely different league.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4805px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="e8EgJsKANeKAZYiKovZah5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8EgJsKANeKAZYiKovZah5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4805" height="2707" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thinking of the Disk Pro as another external SSD is reductive, as it manages to be so much more than that. Yes, it has 1TB of storage and a built-in USB-C cable that makes connecting to phones and tablets highly convenient, but you also get active cooling in the way of an integrated fan. The biggest highlight is that the SSD gets an HDMI port alongside two USB-A ports, turning it into a portable dock. Oh, and did I mention it has magnets at the back that lets you attach it to the back of your phone?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5054px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fMPd8bZDCqZtiDoQG5X8G5" name="Sharge Disk Pro" alt="Sharge Disk Pro external SSD review by Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMPd8bZDCqZtiDoQG5X8G5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5054" height="2847" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Essentially, this is an external SSD and a dock all turned into one. The Disk Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shargetech/disk-pro">just debuted on Kickstarter</a>, and it costs $189 for the 1TB model that I'm using.

Finding the ways AI can help your workflows or improve your daily life can be difficult, especially without compromising quality.</p><p>I've found that AI chatbots like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-havent-used-chatgpt-since-2023-heres-why-gemini-is-all-the-ai-i-need">Gemini or ChatGPT</a> are excellent at lending a hand when you have a specific problem that requires personalized context. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini first helped me tend to my plants</a> earlier this year; I <em>could've</em> used a search engine for ideas, but none would've been able to take the real-world appearance of the plants into account.</p><p>For those without a green thumb, I discovered yet another use case for mobile AI while struggling to come up with a design layout for my apartment. After a year of moving things around, buying new furniture, and reading unhelpful articles online, I finally pulled out my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> in a moment of frustration and turned to Gemini for help. I didn't expect much, but was blown away by what Google AI came up with.</p><p>Here's how I used AI to solve a complicated interior design issue, and how you can use it to help with your own problems too.</p><h2 id="giving-gemini-the-right-starting-point-2">Giving Gemini the right starting point</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XP5RZLwopKsQ5uQJYPBKd4" name="Gemini-Interior-Design-4" alt="Gemini chats showing interior design tips on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XP5RZLwopKsQ5uQJYPBKd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The problem with my apartment is simple: it's fairly large, but there's only one window in the living room, kitchen, and dining area. The window is actually a sliding glass door, and is flanked by perpendicular walls with double doors, which limits furniture placement. With one natural light source, the wrong layout could make this long and relatively narrow living space feel dark and bland — that's why I needed to turn to AI.</p><p>AI is worst when you don't point it in the right direction, and best when you provide it with ample context and thorough prompts. Instead of giving Gemini a vague and generic prompt, I found the exact floor plan for my space for context and clearly stated my goals. The prompt doesn't have to be lengthy, but it does need to be thoughtful and specific.</p><p>In this case, after providing the floor plan, I asked Gemini how to lay out the living room to get the most lighting.</p><h2 id="gemini-s-personalized-and-specific-help-2">Gemini's personalized and specific help</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JHvQJN4gDdXnL9GiNrTB85" name="Gemini-Interior-Design-2" alt="Gemini chats showing interior design tips on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JHvQJN4gDdXnL9GiNrTB85.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini quickly responded with some general tips, like avoiding blocking the light source, using reflective surfaces, and choosing light colors. These were helpful in their own right, but giving Gemini an understanding of the floor plan returned personalized results. The chatbot understood that "the living room is a central, long space with a large window at the end."</p><p>It sounds simple, but Gemini having a basic understanding of the layout already gave it a massive advantage over search engines or interior design websites. As an example of how, one of the sites I read suggested renovating the room to change the positions of windows and doors, which was laughably unhelpful for a renter.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Cd5XopdBBz8xwzr9yqNfe4" name="Gemini-Interior-Design-1" alt="Gemini chats showing interior design tips on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cd5XopdBBz8xwzr9yqNfe4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> provided three detailed suggestions, and I went with the "open flow" layout.

To avoid moving stuff around like a madman, I asked Gemini to come up with a few examples of what this would look like in my space — another thing I couldn't have done without AI.</p><p>The other cool thing about using AI for problem-solving and brainstorming is that you can ask further questions as you go. If you have essential needs, like a TV in a certain spot, Gemini can take that into account and only provide solutions that meet this requirement.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7pVfTUBXvNjgzr59fnAiW4" name="Gemini-Mirror-Tips" alt="Gemini chats showing interior design tips on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7pVfTUBXvNjgzr59fnAiW4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI also suggested ideas and solutions that never even crossed my mind — like using mirrors around the room to simulate more windows and natural light in the space.

If you don't provide an AI chatbot with ample context, it only has its training material to go off of, which can lead to unhelpful results. You can go about providing context in a few ways, such as providing AI photos or screenshots, like I did with my apartment's floor plan. Or, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users">use features like Gemini Live that share your surroundings</a> via your phone's camera, which are other ways to provide context.</p><p>From there, be sure to write a thorough prompt that clearly explains your goals and what you need AI to do.

However, there's something to be said about using earbuds by audio-first companies like Sony or Bose. In particular, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-review">Bose's QuietComfort Ultra earbuds</a> were known for delivering premium sound and active noise-canceling (ANC) on the go.</p><p>Now, Bose is here with a second-generation revision of the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds, and they're even better.

They're the exact same as the first-generation model, but that's because they didn't need changing. The Bluetooth earpiece-style appearance of the earbuds does make them look a bit dated, although the design helped Bose cram battery life and audio gear into this package.</p><p>QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are certainly on the larger side; however, the big surface on the outer side of the earbud provides plenty of room for swipe gestures and media control. There are no buttons on the earbuds, just the capacitive touch area, which can be personalized in the Bose app on iOS and Android.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2Ex7Hb8usPGwUQu8HMLxcE" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-4" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds showing a single earbud and its ear tip." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Ex7Hb8usPGwUQu8HMLxcE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I have issues with certain earbud styles staying in my ear securely, and naturally, I thought the large footprint of the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) would pose an issue. My experience turned out to be the complete opposite.</p><p>The silicone ear tips with a built-in earwax guard, the stability bands, and overall design combine to create a secure and comfortable fit. You get three pairs of ear tips and stability bands each in the box to tailor your fit. The stability bands are crucial — they're silicone inserts that rest against your outer ear and ear lobe to add another point of security.</p><p>I took the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) on multiple runs, and became even more impressed with their fitment. I can comfortably say these earbuds offer the best fit of any pair that doesn't have a physical ear hook for stability. My typical running earbuds are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a>, which have an ear hook, but the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) felt just as secure. In fact, the Bose earbuds actually felt better in the ear, but they're lacking the hooks for peace-of-mind.</p><p>In other words, the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are more than suited for comfortable, everyday wear and can even handle double duty as a workout pair. They do only have an IPX4 water-resistance rating, so be wary of sweat and rain.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="egFbQukXBHof9cuAR5vbbG" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-8" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds in their case beside a phone with the Bose app open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egFbQukXBHof9cuAR5vbbG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are more changes when it comes to audio and ANC, but the overall experience is the same. You still get Bluetooth 5.3 support and compatibility with AAC, SBC, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">AptX Adaptive codecs</a>. Unfortunately, support for AptX on phones isn't as good as we'd like it to be, so you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-tiny-dongle-brings-aptx-lossless-to-any-phone-and-its-fantastic">may need a transmitter</a> to take advantage of the earbuds' 24-bit lossless support.</p><p>In terms of sound, the QuietComfort Ultra (Gen 2) deliver the best bass performance I've ever heard out of a pair of wireless earbuds. It doesn't seem to come at the expensive of the rest of the soundstage, with mids and highs still present. The earbuds have an Immersive Audio mode for those that like a spatial effect, and the Bose app adds a stellar EQ that lets you tune the sound signature to your liking.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GasGWnnHNdLtmGS8iZDqJF" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-10" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds in their case beside a phone with the Bose app open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GasGWnnHNdLtmGS8iZDqJF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Bose earbuds prioritize bass much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/i-put-oneplus-buds-4-up-against-buds-pro-3">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-3-review">Nothing Ear 3</a>, I find that their sound profile doesn't change the listening experience for indie and jazzy tracks — that's a good thing. So, even though you can adjust the EQ if you find the earbuds too bassy, you probably won't need to.</p><p>Bose is using AI to provide better ANC and call quality, and it leads to impressive results. Aside from the basic ANC and Aware modes, there's a new ActiveSense mode here that offers transparency while still blocking out extreme burst of noise. Think a police siren or a passing train near a busy street. It's impressive, and I successfully used the ANC to cancel out noise on part of an intercontinental flight, even though I'd still prefer over-ears for that specific use case.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-what-s-not-good"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2): What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q29qrUxhfjafaSED9wXaDA" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-6" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds showing a single earbud with the Bose logo facing outward." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q29qrUxhfjafaSED9wXaDA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Buyer's guides</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds"><strong>Best wireless earbuds</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones"><strong>Best wireless headphones</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-for-noise-cancellation-2025"><strong>Best ANC earbuds</strong></a></p></div></div><p>There are only two clear drawbacks to the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) worth pointing out. The first is that the capacitive touch controls are lackluster, and had me wishing for physical buttons. They don't miss any gestures or tap, which is great, but are a little overeager. Adjusting the fit of your earbuds by twisting them into your ear will probably pause your music, which can be frustrating at times.</p><p>Earbuds like Powerbeats Pro 2, which have a play/pause button and volume rocker, provide a better on-earbud experience than Bose — that's too be expected. But other earbuds with capacitive earbud stems, such as the AirPods Pro 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, are also better at avoiding accidental inputs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G3E7RbsAyNz8imcJYqzgQm" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-2" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds with their case opened." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G3E7RbsAyNz8imcJYqzgQm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then, there's a battery life. It's great that the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) now come with a wireless charging case as standard. Before, you had to add a clunky wireless charging cover for an extra $50 to add that feature.</p><p>However, the six-hour battery life per earbud is unimpressive. The charging case only brings that total up to 24 hours, so heavy users like myself find themselves needing to charge the case multiple times per week. It's also worth noting that if you turn on Immersive Audio, that'll fall to just four hours of battery life per earbud.</p><p>Six hours of playback time isn't out of the ordinary with ANC enabled, but it's barely enough to cover my regular flight from Phoenix to New York, and it won't last a full workday. Apple just added eight-hour battery life to the AirPods Pro 3, so the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are starting to lag behind in this regard.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-competition"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2): Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="w2MHcutzKG6qVwHvmHCQcH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w2MHcutzKG6qVwHvmHCQcH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's never been more competition for great wireless earbuds for ANC, so Bose had its work cut out for it when making the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2). I think they're the pair of wireless earbuds to beat — other products might beat Bose in one or two areas, but none match the complete experience. For instance, I've been testing the brand-new AirPods Pro 3 against the Bose earbuds, and Apple's earbuds are better at battery life and noise canceling but are still severely behind in comfort and fit.</p><p>I'd also give Bose the edge over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds</a>, which simply cannot fit in my ears comfortably, and don't sound as good in my view. The closest competitor in sound may be the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which are similarly full in the low-end but don't fit as securely and have worse ANC.</p><p>As such, if you have $299 to spend on ANC earbuds with excellent fitment, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are your best option.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-should-you-buy-them"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2): Should you buy them?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QTAdWzpFLPd4kgpSxRwfZG" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-7" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds in their case beside a phone with the Bose app open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QTAdWzpFLPd4kgpSxRwfZG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want industry-leading comfort and a secure fit for workouts</li><li>You crave a full and deep sound signature with excellent bass</li><li>You need platform-agnostic ANC earbuds that work with any Bluetooth device</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You find the earbud and charging case size to be too large</li><li>You'd rather buy a cheaper pair of earbuds closer to the $200 price point</li><li>You don't like the earbuds' loud audio profile and booming bass</li></ul><p>Bose delivers fantastic sound and great ANC on the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2), but so do many other audio brands. What separates the Bose earbuds from the field is their top-notch comfort and fit. While you might expect them to be uncomfortable or finicky due to their large size, the opposite is true. Between their design, custom ear tips, and silicone stabilizers, the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) are the most comfortable wireless earbuds I've ever worn.</p><p>The tricky thing about comfort and fit as a feature is that it's different for everyone. I trust the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) to fit for most people's ears, but not all will need the fine-tuned fit and security. Some would be just fine wearing AirPods, Galaxy Buds, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds</a>. If that's the case for you, snagging a high-end pair of earbuds from Apple, Samsung, or Google might be a better option than paying as much as $100 more for Bose earbuds.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9f37e178-d333-4d23-b7b1-5ff91df7f7d2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YJwSx2qUb66cj6TbCtJWEE.jpg' alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds Gen 2</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The ones to beat</strong></em></p><p>While there are many challengers, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds (Gen 2) provide the best mix of comfort, battery life, sound quality, and ANC.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">MediaTek has been killing it</a> the past couple of years when it comes to chips for high-end electronics. While you might think of the company as one that provides cheap, steady workhorse chips for budget gear, the Dimensity line boasts specs just as powerful as whatever name you think of when it comes to a premium smartphone chip. OK, it's Qualcomm, and we all know it's Qualcomm.</p><p>The latest, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9500-is-android-powerhouse-with-major-performance-gains">Dimensity 9500</a>, looks like it got every improvement possible, especially in the right places: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">AI processing</a>. Like it or not, your smart devices are going to become more and more AI-centric, so whatever chip can process it all fast and efficiently is going to feel like it works "better" than the others. MediaTek is right there.</p><p>Everything I think about the Dimensity 9500 is based on what it does "on paper," just like the flagship Dimensity chips before it, simply because I live in the United States and buy phones designed for the United States. AKA: phones <em>without </em>a MediaTek Dimensity 9500 chip inside.</p><p>That makes me sad. Yes, I know I can easily buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-importing-xiaomi-phone-us">Xiaomi phone</a> that uses the chip I want to try, but that's not exactly what I want. I want to try a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-11">Pixel 11</a>, for example, with one in it so I can see how it compares to the others. Since trying the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> and its MediaTek 9300 Plus, I've been itching to try it on a phone that I'm familiar with.</p><p>I had my hopes up at one time for Google to partner with MediaTek (the two companies are very friendly) in the Pixel phones, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-can-a-tech-giant-build-a-smartphone-chip-without-its-own-foundry">designing its own chip</a> is a smarter move, so I won't grumble.</p><p>I simply do not care about how it performs on paper. I do not give a flying, well you know, about benchmarks. I can say anything in a press release and be confident nobody will ever spend the time to prove it's not 100% accurate, and I can make a benchmark app tell you whatever number you want to see with a few minutes in Android Studio. Yeah, I'm saying companies tell little white lies to make their stuff look good. Always have, always will.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.13%;"><img id="8qNBCgTnsSLebADZVZvUNH" name="MediaTek Dimensity 9500 Infographic" alt="A MediaTek Dimensity 9500 infographic describing key stats about the SoC described throughout the article." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8qNBCgTnsSLebADZVZvUNH.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8037" height="5395" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MediaTek)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I have used plenty of products with a MediaTek chip, including the 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr</a> with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">Dimensity 7300X</a>. It's a good chip designed specifically for a flip phone but it's not the flagship powerhouse its bigger brothers are. Having said that, its really good, and you would never think you had a "budget" chip inside your new phone.</p><p>I think MediaTek's improvements to the data path and chain AI processing needs are a good move. It's also something every company likes to remind us they did whenever something new comes along.</p><p>Someone has to do it best, right? It might be MediaTek. Most of us will never know.</p> ]]></dc:content>

OnePlus is pushing that this is a dedicated platform for its U.S. base that "will be distinct, and operated by a new Community Team based in the U.S."</p><h2 id="oneplus-changes-you-2">OnePlus Changes & You</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WsU9mvB2gmHhcvGdrxR7wm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WsU9mvB2gmHhcvGdrxR7wm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once again, all these changes are going on September 26.

This thing weighs 690g, so it's actually much closer to a kilo than the smaller Tab S11. The best Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra cases make it a lot easier to use this glass and metal behemoth. Good cases also add drop protection, which is something you definitely need with such a large and heavy device. A kickstand is the most important feature to look for in a Tab S11 Ultra case, followed closely by a keyboard. Let's take a look at the best tablet covers that include these features.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-tab-s11-is-one-hefty-tablet-get-a-case-with-a-stand-to-use-it-comfortably-2">The Galaxy Tab S11 is one hefty tablet — get a case with a stand to use it comfortably</h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="c8ecaf1a-3e74-4768-9878-2b0ddf87221d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NBk8nEWUyCeD7txZMtFTRj.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra Book Cover Keyboard Slim"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra Book Cover Keyboard Slim</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best keyboard case</strong></em></p><p>Samsung's first-party keyboard case is fabulous.

First-party options from Samsung are the best of the lot, but they are eye-wateringly expensive, touting exorbitant price tags. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra Book Cover Keyboard Slim is wonderfully thin, adding a keyboard to your Tab S11 Ultra along with a stand. However, it costs over $200!</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra Smart Book Cover is the other Samsung case for the 14.6-inch tablet. While it costs half as much as the keyboard case and is also incredibly thin and lightweight, the $100 price is still too much for a mere case.</p><p>Spigen brings more affordable offerings to the table with the heavy-duty Rugged Armor Pro and Ultra Hybrid Pro for the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. Both cost about $50, add drop protection, come with S Pen holders, and have kickstands. Make a decision based on how light you need your tablet cover to be and what level of drop protection you're aiming for.</p><p>If $50 is still too much for you, there are cheaper options available. You could get an off-brand third-party case like the Ltezixal Case or the INFILAND Case, both of which cost $25 each. These cases fulfil the basic requirements of a Tab S11 Ultra case, such as a folio, impact protection, and a kickstand.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The sleek and lightweight Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is the iPhone Air's biggest competition, and thanks to Amazon's October Prime Day sale, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYVL6DB5"><strong>buy the phone unlocked today and save a whopping 36%</strong></a> on your purchase.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-amazon-prime-day-big-deal-days-faq-2025">early Prime Day discount</a> drops the price of the S25 Edge down to $699.99, which is a full $300 cheaper than the starting price of the iPhone Air. Sure, Apple's release is a tiny bit thinner than the Galaxy S25 Edge (5.8mm vs 5.64mm, respectively), but Samsung's phone is 2 grams lighter than its rival. Needless to say, if you want a great deal on a thin phone, I'd recommend that you skip the iPhone Air and live life on the Edge (see what I did there?).</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the official list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="the-best-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-deal-on-the-web-2">The best Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge deal on the web</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="62bb2ec8-9feb-46b4-a102-b681159a8509" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB: $1,099.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB: $1,099.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYVL6DB5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:805px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:115.65%;"><img id="DUNzf4idmhXLRyNApWBWZX" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DUNzf4idmhXLRyNApWBWZX.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="805" height="931" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYVL6DB5" data-dimension112="62bb2ec8-9feb-46b4-a102-b681159a8509" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB: $1,099.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB: $1,099.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,099.99</del><strong> $699.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The iPhone Air may be getting all of the attention, but why settle for Apple when you can score a whopping 36% discount on the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a>?

Most of our tests show that the Galaxy S25 Edge lasts about 12-15 hours on a single charge, which is considerably less than the majority of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there.</p><p>If we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-air-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge">continue to compare</a> the S25 Edge with its iPhone rival, I should also mention that the Samsung phone lacks MagSafe and Qi2 support for convenient charging, although the Edge <em>does </em>have a faster USB-C port to make up for it. Without an accompanying discount, the S25 Edge is also $100 more expensive than the iPhone Air.</p><p>All things said and done, if you're paying full price for a smartphone, the iPhone Air might be the better deal for some folks. But throw on a record-smashing 36% discount and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge becomes an absurdly better value. It might take months for the price of the Apple device to drop this low, so if you want a thin phone today, this choice is easy.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This means you could keep the editing simple by asking the image editor to "make this image" better, and Gemini will make the necessary adjustments to the image, like adjusting the brightness, contrast, and removing unnecessary noise from the picture, so you don't manually have to.  Or you can take it a step further, imagine your pet or that alpaca from the petting zoo chilling in Hawaii with a mojito—Gemini can make it happen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qPBHPvfadQUBfdcPwDUbMS" name="2nd In-Line animation" alt="Conversational photo editing in Google Photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qPBHPvfadQUBfdcPwDUbMS.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It makes things extremely easy when it comes to editing photos, since you can basically chat or speak to Gemini to make certain edits for you that seem somewhat of a task, like Magic Eraser; you previously had to manually refine areas that weren't fully erased, but Gemini streamlines this process.</p><p>But now,  with conversational edits, you can just give Gemini a prompt to “remove the cars in the background” or something more general like “restore this old photo,” and Photos will understand the changes you’re trying to make. And the best part is that Gemini gives you multiple edited images to pick from, so you can choose the one that matches your original idea.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fPmijCCrZosdvQ7srXWCec" name="Android_Alpaca+conversational+edit" alt="Google expands conversational edit feature to all Android users" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPmijCCrZosdvQ7srXWCec.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And it doesn't end there; you will also be able to give Gemini multiple edits in one go, like  “remove the reflections and fix the washed-out colors.” The AI bot also gives you several prompt suggestions based on the image you're editing, which helps out if you need a little inspiration.

It comes with ZAGG's EZ Apply installation tray, is made of highly durable Glass Elite tempered glass that's five times stronger than the industry standard, and has an oil-repelling layer on top. The edges of the Glass Elite Tablet Screen Protector are reinforced to prevent cracks from spreading, even if they do occur. The only problem with this kit is the $50 price tag.</p><p>So if you're on the hunt for something cheaper, the SPARIN 2 Pack Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 costs just $10 but includes two pieces of tempered glass screen protectors.

Now, Meta is here with a second-generation version of the three iconic Ray-Ban smart glasses styles, packing revamped hardware. The recent Oakley Meta HSTN launch brought extra battery life and crisper video recording to Meta smart glasses, and now those advancements are headed to Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2.</p><p>Meta is continuing to sell the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review#section-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-specs-and-how-they-work">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1</a> at a lower price than the Gen 2 smart glasses, creating an interesting dilemma for interested buyers. Should owners of the Gen 1 smart glasses upgrade to the Gen 2 revision, and should new buyers pay more for the extra features? Those are the questions we'll help you answer in this comparison between Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2. Let's dive in.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-2-vs-gen-1-pricing-and-availability-2">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Gen 2 vs Gen 1: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-display-Meta-Store-4" alt="A display of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses in various styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta revealed the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 smart glasses at Connect 2025. They are available now online and at partner retailers for $379. They're sold in the same Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles as the first-generation smart glasses, but there are a few limited-edition colorways for early adopters. The same range of prescription lenses is supported, too, with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00 being compatible.</p><p>The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses are sticking around at a $299 price point, but some styles are out of stock. Skyler and Wayfarer styles appear to be available, although it's unclear for how long or if stock will be replenished. You can equip them with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00, just like Gen 2.</p><p>For those with advanced prescription needs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-glasses-prescription-limitations-and-workaround">there are third-party workarounds available</a>.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-2-vs-gen-1-design-and-specs-2">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Gen 2 vs Gen 1: Design and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nrnxwJW9AvBU3aj7emHzt8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-Black-glasses-on-display" alt="Black Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses sitting on a metal display shelf." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nrnxwJW9AvBU3aj7emHzt8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2</a> are identical to the first-generation pair of smart glasses from a design standpoint. You can choose between Wayfarer, Skyler, or Headliner styles depending on which you prefer, but these frames will look virtually identical across the Gen 1 and Gen 2 models. You get a camera on one side of the frames for photos and video recording, plus an LED indicator light on the opposite side to let others know when you're capturing content.</p><p>The big change to the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2's design and dimensions is that Meta managed to shave a few grams of weight off the frames. The new pair of smart glasses weighs 48 grams, down from 52 grams on the Gen 1 model.</p><p>I had comfort issues with Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 at times, partially due to the weight, which caused the glasses to slip down the bridge of my nose at times. I don't know whether the four-gram difference in weight will make the Gen 2 noticeably more comfortable, but I don't think it can hurt either.</p><div ><table><caption>Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</p></th><th  ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Styles</p></td><td  ><p>Wayfarer, Headliner, Skyler</p></td><td  ><p>Wayfarer, Skyler, Headliner (out of stock)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Lenses</p></td><td  ><p>Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0)</p></td><td  ><p>Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultra-Wide</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultra-Wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Photo resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait default)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video resolution</p></td><td  ><p>1200p at 60FPS</p><p>1440p at 30FPS</p><p>3K at 30FPS</p></td><td  ><p>1440 x 1920 pixels at 30 fps (Vertical default)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>2X open ear speakers</p></td><td  ><p>2X open ear speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Microphones</p></td><td  ><p>Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad)</p></td><td  ><p>Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 500 photos, 100 30-second videos</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 500+ photos (3 frame burst)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Compatibility</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>52g</p></td><td  ><p>49.2g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 8 hours per charge</p><p>5 hours continuous audio playback or voice calling</p></td><td  ><p>4 hours per charge: 30 minutes live streaming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging (glasses) case</p></td><td  ><p>48 hours worth of charge</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 32 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging speed</p></td><td  ><p>50% in 20 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>50% in 20 minutes</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses offer a 12MP ultra-wide camera, with support for 3024 X 4032 resolution photos.

Just like the Meta Oakley HSTN smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses can last up to eight hours on a single charge. That's double the four-hour battery life of the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses.</p><p>In the real world, that means you can take more photos, record more videos, and listen to more audio without needing to pop the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 into their charging case. In fact, the new model nets you five hours of continuous audio playback or voice calling. Both the Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses can charge up to 50% in 20 minutes in a pinch.</p><p>You charge both pairs of smart glasses by popping them into an included charging case, which has its own internal battery and a USB-C port. The case is also used for pairing with the Meta AI companion app and has a button for connections and resets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Smart-Glasses-close-up.jpeg" alt="A close-up of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zbs6FE7iQYqfKbPUdVcGua.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ai-is-evolving-again-and-its-resurrecting-the-metaverse">Meta AI is becoming more robust</a>, supporting voice assistance and camera inputs.

As such, paying the extra $80 for the Gen 2 is a no-brainer when you consider all the quality-of-life upgrades you'll get.</p><p>You should consider whether <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta Display</a>, Oakley Meta HSTN, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> might suit you better if you have specialized use cases, like the need for a display or fitness-focused glasses.</p><p>However, those with the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses shouldn't feel the pressure to upgrade immediately. If the camera quality and battery life are meeting your expectations, hold onto them. The experience between models is largely the same, you'll just need to charge your Gen 1 pair more frequently.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3ba678d4-1d84-40c6-8444-ed9ca77c890e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Drr6BvBvMgCFoowJyoiLHk.jpg' alt="An official product render of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses Wayfarer style with blue frames and blue lenses"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The one to buy</strong></em></p><p>Meta addressed the major drawbacks of Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 with the second-generation revision, and they only cost a bit more.

It also tackles a known issue with color casts, so your photos now show truer, more balanced colors in any light.</p><p>AI SuperRes Zoom now makes zoomed-in text look crisper, and Action Mode cuts down noise and grain for cleaner motion shots. Even third-party camera apps are getting clearer results now. On the video side, contrast has been boosted, haze reduced, and colors look livelier, so clips should pop more on playback.</p><h2 id="under-the-hood-fixes-2">Under-the-hood fixes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yF5bo9qAcjArTSasvEzHMR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yF5bo9qAcjArTSasvEzHMR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing didn’t stop at camera polish. The update fixes a few annoying bugs and smooths out some rough edges across the interface.</p><p>The Glyph Matrix feature works better when you’re using multi-user mode alongside Always-on Glyph Toys, and a pesky bug that duplicated contact avatars when setting new Essential Notification rules has been squashed.</p><p>Haptic feedback is back to normal when previewing Generative notifications, and alignment issues with Arabic titles in the “About phone” section have been corrected. There’s also a cleaner interface for Bluetooth device recording tucked under Settings → Sound & Vibration → Bluetooth device recording.</p><p>On top of that, the update reduces heating and battery drain in certain scenarios, while Wi-Fi connectivity and overall network stability have been optimized.</p><p>Even though this build is still based on Android 15, Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-os-4-0-revealed">recently teased its next big step</a>: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-teases-refined-and-redefined-os-4-0-thats-coming-soon">Nothing OS 4.0 based on Android 16</a>. The update roadmap confirms that alongside the Phone 3, devices like the Phone 3a series, Phone 2 models, and CMF Phones will all get the upgrade.</p><p>For now, though, Phone 3 owners should head to Settings → Software Update and grab this release. Between the camera upgrades, performance fixes, and improved connectivity, it’s a worthwhile refresh ahead of the bigger changes to come.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The OpenFit 2 Plus brings back these same perks, largely unchanged.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hg6yzbhLE9JDpwDxMtaS4a" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-close-up" alt="A close-up of the Shokz OpenFit 2 earbuds, one facing the camera showing the logo and top button/speaker grill, the other laying on its back showing the main speaker grill, mic hole, and ear hook." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hg6yzbhLE9JDpwDxMtaS4a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now, however, the Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus has enabled a Dolby Audio mode, in addition to the current options like bass boost. This mode cuts the battery life down from 11 hours to 9 hours, but in exchange, you get richer, more cinematic audio, best suited for streaming movies or shows but also improving your workout playlists.</p><p>While we've yet to test the Dolby Audio mode, our friends at Techradar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/fitness-headphones/i-went-for-a-run-with-the-all-new-shokz-openfit-2-and-theyre-already-threatening-to-become-my-go-to-running-headphones">reviewed the OpenFit 2+</a> and said that "everything becomes richer and more pronounced" with it toggled on, making the OpenFit 2 feel "obsolete" by comparison. We were impressed by the OpenFit 2's audio quality, which makes us excited to try this new mode.</p><p>In addition, the OpenFit 2 Plus comes with a Qi-compatible charging case, so you can leave your OpenFit 2s on a compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers">wireless charger</a> to refill its 48 hours of total capacity between workouts. USB-C charging currently refills the case and earbuds in about 100 minutes, but Shokz hasn't confirmed how long Qi charging will take.</p><p>Many recent wireless workout earbuds, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> and AirPods Pro 3, are using your ear canals to measure heart rate. It'll be interesting to see if this approach resonates with athletes, or if they'll prefer an option that leaves their ear canals open but still delivers Dolby-level sound.</p><p>The Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus is available in Black, Grey, and Stone Blue through most retailers; limited-edition HYROX earbuds with a black and gold finish are only available through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shokz.com/products/openfit2plus">Shokz's site</a>, as part of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shokz-joins-hyrox-as-the-official-headphone-partner-of-hyrox-north-america-to-support-everyday-athletes-nationwide-302555665.html">official partnership</a> with the race series.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3a5c4ade-7f18-44b1-a5b1-524d76ff0cc2">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SHOKZ-Open-Ear-Headphones-Comfortable-Water-Resistant/dp/B0DYCJSZLS/" data-model-name="Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kj8keyq5rW7qcvXmjNbzM6.png' alt="Render of the black Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus wireless earbuds and case"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Shokz OpenFit 2+ offer a unique alternative to bone conduction headphones, with rich, targeted audio, comfortably secure earhooks, dependable battery life, decent water resistance, and multipoint pairing to sync with both your phone and laptop. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Additionally, 6G is said to provide super low latency, meaning the time it takes for a signal to travel is expected to be reduced to microseconds, approximately a 1,000-fold improvement over 5G.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9wyywEe3rQigau5EgpDuVH" name="6G- samsung-plans" alt="Samsung lays out what's in store with 6G connectivity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9wyywEe3rQigau5EgpDuVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nokia.com/6g/6g-explained/#:~:text=A%20network%20that%20can%20sense,the%20environment%2C%20people%20and%20objects.">Nokia states</a> that the new network will have the ability to "sense" the environment by using signals that will essentially bounce off obstacles or objects that come in its path. This will allow it to figure out what those objects are, where they are, how fast they're moving, and what they're made of.</p><p>By combining this information with AI, the network can create a "digital twin" of the physical world. This will allow companies to create a map that will provide 6G signals to the user faster.</p><p>Finally, Verizon is also working with organizations like 3GPP, so that their research in 6G aligns with network standards worldwide. "This helps create a unified 6G network that everyone can use, no matter who made their device or where they are," it added.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To get us going, Google states this major update is rolling out for viewers with a TCL QM9K series device. Consumers with the Google TV Streamer, Walmart onn. 4K Pro, 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and UX models, and 2025 TCL QM7K, QM8K, and X11K models will have to wait until "later this year."</p><p>This major Gemini for Google TV is calling the old (and still existing) Assistant old news, as the post states the newer AI model "goes beyond simple commands." Users can talk to Gemini with natural speech, as you would to a person sitting beside you. Saying "Hey Google" (or by pressing the mic button on your remote) will let you experience a new world of AI-assisted TV, such as when you're unsure about what to watch.</p><p>Google says users can ask Gemini to suggest some movies when it's hard to find something that two people with varying tastes may enjoy. If you like dramas, but your partner likes comedies, you can tell Gemini those interests and see what it finds.</p><p>Gemini can also get you "caught up" if you missed a season of a popular show, and it can even turn your "vague" show descriptions into something you can work with.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="FYV28kszRKm3Wbc6VKLCrJ" name="google-tv-gemini-launch-asking-question-example" alt="Gemini for Google TV delivers a floating bar of text with a user's voice prompt in it, asking for the AI to explain a recent show's season for them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FYV28kszRKm3Wbc6VKLCrJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="aMReUJLUJsaNe6kvynAErJ" name="google-tv-gemini-launch-educational-example" alt="Gemini for Google TV delivers a text-based explainer for a child about "why volcanoes erupt," as well as offering a row of YouTube videos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aMReUJLUJsaNe6kvynAErJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Gemini for Google TV is reportedly leaning into its educational abilities in this new update, and it's bringing YouTube with it. The company states that parents can ask Gemini to "explain" or expand on certain real-world phenomena. To explain, the post highlights that Gemini will deliver a text-based explainer, alongside a row of recommended YouTube videos to further the subject.</p><p>Moreover, Google teases that Gemini can also help you with tutorials and cooking ideas right from your TV.</p><p>As previously stated, Gemini for Google TV is rolling out today (Sep 22) for consumers with a TCL QM9K series device. The post alludes to there being even more Gemini capabilities "coming soon." We'll have to see if these additional features coincide with Gemini's release on more devices later in 2025.</p><h2 id="there-s-even-more-from-google-tv-on-the-way-2">There's even more from Google TV on the way</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oXcrZwfzk2M2rzeMv2kqtQ" name="google-tv-streamer-review-free-live-tv-2.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer Free Live TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXcrZwfzk2M2rzeMv2kqtQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We were hearing about this Gemini update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tvs-gemini-upgrade-promises-smarter-and-more-enjoyable-viewing-experience">Google TV during CES 2025</a>, which is when the company said you could just "speak naturally to your TV." That idea was stated alongside the idea that users wouldn't need to say "Hey Google." However, with today's update, we're seeing that the wake-up prompt is still there, but users can also press their microphone button and begin speaking.</p><p>Google stated that Gemini on Google TV would connect with a homeowner's smart devices, allowing the choice of checking in on doorbell cameras and more. This pretty much sounds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-updates-control-center-entertainment-smart-home">personal control center-esque update</a> we got a few months prior to CES 2025.</p><p>Google's current teaser of more Gemini features to come with its Google TV introduction was echoed in January. The company said that by the end of 2025, Google TV will feature proximity sensors that react to your presence, which could kick off a photo slideshow and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The design is thankfully unchanged, with Bose retaining the same aesthetic and build quality.</p><p>If anything, the biggest change this time has to do with the case; it has the same design as last time, but it now includes wireless charging as standard. This was a notable omission with the earlier model, and it's good to see Bose make amends. I was able to easily charge the case by plonking it down on the Qi 2 mat of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/baseus-nomos-140w-charging-station-review">Baseus Nomos charging station</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5025px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="pFGvSgn6wGLX77tgjEvmTH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pFGvSgn6wGLX77tgjEvmTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5025" height="2830" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Having used the QuietComfort Ultra extensively, the Gen 2 buds are immediately familiar. Bose sells the buds in four color choices — Black, White Smoke, Deep Plum, and Midnight Violet — and I'd suggest getting the violet model if you want a vibrant hue. I've got the White Smoke edition, and while the color is fine, it doesn't exactly stand out all that much.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5115px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="hD4WTxcKkzj2g7KHoHTTVH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hD4WTxcKkzj2g7KHoHTTVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5115" height="2881" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The fit is identical to its predecessor, and the stabilizers that sit outside the shell ensure you get a tight seal while still being comfortable. Although these buds look a little bigger than their rivals, there are absolutely no issues with comfort, and the sound nozzle doesn't extend too much into the inner ear. You get a good range of accessories to tailor the fit, and there's no fatigue even with long-term use. In short, they're among the most comfortable earbuds around today.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="FSsg3oePsu7v2FKfc2oSTH" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds 2nd Gen" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds Gen 2 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FSsg3oePsu7v2FKfc2oSTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The bundled ear tips include a filter by default, doing a better job protecting the shell.

Without knowing everything that was found and investigated, it's impossible to know how much of that is true, but it doesn't really matter because U.S. interests (public <em>and</em> private) would have just found another reason. Huawei needed to leave the market, and the faster the better.</p><p>It's about those little symbols at the top of your phone: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">5G</a>. In the U.S., Huawei's phones weren't any better than others when it came to 5G connectivity, but Huawei makes more than phones. A lot more.</p><p>No, I don't mean <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/huawei-watch-ultimate-2-is-the-smartwatch-upgrade-you-need">watches</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-mediapad-m5-hands">tablets</a>. I mean "heavy" network gear and switches that telecom companies need. In particular, Huawei was able to make network equipment that worked as well as anyone else could build and sell it cheaper. When that happened, companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fierce-network.com/wireless/at-t-may-phase-out-huawei-equipment-network-upgrades-mexico#:~:text=AT&T%20will%20likely%20phase%20out,their%20networks%20outside%20the%20U.S." target="_blank">AT&T</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/11/ceo-hans-vestberg-says-verizon-does-not-use-any-huawei-equipment.html#:~:text=Verizon%20CEO:%20We're%20doing%20just%20fine%20without,from%20the%20Chinese%20trade%20war%2C%22%20says%20Vestberg" target="_blank">Verizon</a>, as well as more industrial companies we've never heard of, started to buy it.</p><p>The U.S. is weird when it comes to a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/justice-department-vs-google-ruling-search-dominance">monopoly</a>" in the market. Some politicians think one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/house-democrats-say-tech-companies-have-monopoly-needs-broken">should never exist,</a> some think only the companies they like should be able to dominate a market, but almost all of them feel that if there is going to be one, it can't be a company from China or with ties to the Chinese government.</p><p>Huawei is both, and the fears that it was state-sponsored before the ban may or may not have been true, but they are now. The very same thing would happen here in the U.S. if China banned a company with a high market share: the government would do whatever it takes to save it.</p><p>You can still buy a Huawei product in the U.S. from a reseller, but the hardware and the software are not going to work as designed, there will be no warranty, and it might not work at all. I'd advise against it.</p><h2 id="about-coming-back-2">About coming back</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="gLn9gs4gzbpGSJxqqD8zG9" name="NVIDIA-GPU-Tech-Conf-2.jpg" alt="GPU Technology Conference sign." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gLn9gs4gzbpGSJxqqD8zG9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Huawei has thrived despite being banned in the U.S. The company still sells plenty of phones and other mobile products, but it's also a leader when it comes to (you guessed it) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/08/leashing-chinese-ai-needs-smart-chip-controls.html#:~:text=According%20to%20SemiAnalysis%2C%20Huawei's%20new,memory%20bandwidth%2C%20and%20integrated%20networking." target="_blank">AI</a>. If Huawei ever wanted to do business here or with American companies without restrictions, a lot would have to change.</p><p>I don't think Huawei would be willing (or should be willing) to step backwards so it can sell more phones in the land of rampant consumerism. It should continue to build out a portfolio of products, services, and mobile offerings without caring what the U.S. government thinks about it. With the company further entrenched with the Chinese government and having expanded into the field of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/huawei-shows-off-ai-computing-system-rival-nvidias-top-product-2025-07-26/">AI hardware</a>, technology, and research, everything the "right" people did not like about Huawei is now even "worse" than it was when the ban was placed.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with the company striving to be an example of Chinese national pride, the same way Ford or General Motors once was in the U.S. Of course, I'm not privy to any information that would prove me wrong and have no say in the matter, so I'm going with it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Clearly I was wrong, but if you (like me) were waiting for the right Galaxy Z Fold 7 deal to come along, now's your chance to grab the top-rated foldable at a much more reasonable price. </p> ]]></dc:content>

If you want a keyboard case, nothing works better than the Galaxy Tab S11 Book Cover Keyboard Slim. However, it's also eye-wateringly expensive, priced at an ungodly $145. And if you skip the keyboard to cut costs, the basic Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Book Cover isn't any better. Without a keyboard, you'd still pay a whopping $90 for a mere tablet cover with a folio and stand.</p><p>Of course, Samsung's own cases work like a dream, hugging the Tab S11 in all the right places. However, at those prices, you're better off getting dupes that function almost as well as the first-party ones. Alternatively, you can turn to reliable name brands such as Spigen to get quality you can depend on. The Spigen Rugged Armor Pro for Galaxy Tab S11 is rugged, affordable, and practical. With raised edges and several layers of material added to it for better drop-proofing, it is somewhat bulky, but you get ease of mind in exchange. The Spigen case also has a kickstand and an S Pen storage compartment.</p><p>If it's dupes you're interested in, the Doohoeek Bluetooth Keyboard Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 is a cost effective keyboard case for the Tab S11. It has a backlit keyboard, scissor-switch keys, a low profile, a kickstand, and even an S Pen slot. If you want to go even cheaper, the HUKWIMO Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 is a budget-friendly buy without a keyboard. It imitates the three-fold design of the first-party Tab S11 Book Cover, so you can fold the cover to convert it into a stand in three different ways.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Additional upgrades include better support for Now Bar apps and various security enhancements.</p><p>For now, the One UI 8 update for the Galaxy S24, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Galaxy Z Flip 6 is limited to South Korea, but Samsung should be rolling it out in other markets soon.

This potential feature is presumably designed to limit how much of your screen can be seen from side angles.</p><p>The idea is simple but smart: if you’re on a bus or standing in a crowded line, the person next to you shouldn’t get an eyeful of your banking details or private chats.</p><p>According to the leaked code strings, Private Display isn’t just a manual toggle. Samsung is baking in some intelligence here. The feature can reportedly kick in automatically when you’re using sensitive apps — like banking, messaging, or payment services — or when the phone detects you’re in a crowded place.</p><p>There also seem to be multiple levels of privacy, including a “Maximum Privacy” mode that heavily dims the screen for stronger protection, and manual settings for people who prefer full control. Users might even be able to pick specific apps to trigger the feature or schedule when it turns on.</p><h2 id="new-hardware-needed-2">New hardware needed</h2><p>What makes this particularly exciting is that it likely ties into new hardware. Samsung’s display division has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungdisplay.com/eng/media/news/detail/ssdsNews-240227.jsp" target="_blank">been developing “Flex Magic Pixel” technology</a>, an AI-driven pixel adjustment that changes viewing angles. However, this tech is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1957681630509953114" target="_blank">rumored</a> to be compatible only with the Galaxy S26 Ultra and probably future Ultra models.</p><p>That means Private Display won’t be coming to every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>. Without the right panel tech, older models probably won’t be able to pull this off.</p><p>Timing-wise, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> has already started rolling out to some devices, but One UI 8.5 is expected to make its official debut alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> series in early 2026. Samsung could still tweak or delay some parts of Private Display before launch, but what’s already been uncovered shows a lot of promise.</p><p>Instead of forcing users to rely on clunky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-screen-protectors">third-party screen protectors</a>, Samsung looks ready to build smarter, more seamless privacy directly into its hardware and software. For anyone who hates shoulder surfers, this should be a meaningful upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company is quick to acknowledge that its AI isn't perfect.

Parents are getting pulled in, too. Starting today, Instagram will send notifications to parents in Canada with conversation tips, developed with pediatric psychologist Dr. Ann-Louise Lockhart, on how to talk with their teens about using their real birthdays online.</p><p>Instagram's message is clear: if teens list the right ages, the system can protect them better.</p><p>The company says more than 54 million teens worldwide are already in Teen Accounts, and 97% of 13 to 15-year-olds have kept the protections on. Over 90% of surveyed parents think the safeguards help, but many still feel overwhelmed by managing their kids’ online lives. By nudging parents directly and backing them up with AI, Instagram is hoping to close the gap.</p><p>The platform admits age verification online is still an industry-wide headache. Even with AI and parental involvement, misrepresentation happens. Still, by linking parental approval and app store age checks with its own tech, Instagram is trying to make it harder for underage users to slip through the cracks.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We got to go hands-on with all of them, and I've used several pairs since 2021.</p><p>Despite coming out with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</a>, Meta isn't sunsetting the Gen 1s at all. In fact, the company is keeping them around as the most affordable entry in the lineup, with the price scaling up from there. In total, Meta has half a dozen different smart glasses to choose from.</p><p>So which pair of Meta smart glasses is right for you? They all have Meta AI at their core and can take pictures, record video, and mirror earbud functionality when paired with any phone, but is the least expensive pair your best bet? Or should you get something a little more premium? I answer all those questions and more below.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-gen-1"><span>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1)</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZvVXQ3wkTPHurSmVMcu9hC" name="Ray-Ban-Stories-2023-recording-LED-02.jpg" alt="The status LED on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZvVXQ3wkTPHurSmVMcu9hC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite what the name says, Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) is actually the second-generation Ray-Ban smart glasses product. The original was called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ray-ban-stories-facebook-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Stories</a> and debuted in September 2021, but the rebrand to Ray-Ban Meta for the second product was for a big reason. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) was a superb upgrade, offering Meta AI capabilities, significantly better video and picture quality, surround sound audio recording and playback, and better battery life.</p><p>Despite Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) being the cheapest of the bunch, they're still a wonderful pair of smart glasses that I think most people will be happy with. They come in three classic Ray-Ban styles — Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler — each with a wide selection of lens colors and tints. And yes, you can even get prescription lenses from -6.00 to +4.00.</p><p>But Meta doesn't seem to be stocking all available lens colors for the Gen 1s anymore. As of this writing, Meta only offers Wayfarer and Skyler on its website, and Best Buy has a very limited selection, as well.</p><div ><table><caption>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1)</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Style options</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>3 Frames, 3 colors per style. High and low bridge options. Large or small size (Wayfarer-only).</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Lens options</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>Clear, solid tint, Transitions, prescription (-6.00 to +4.00)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 4 hours per charge</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera quality</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>12MP ultrawide, 1080p 30FPS video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio quality</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>76.1dB dual speakers, 5 mics</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Additional features</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>Meta AI with camera and microphone access, video livestreaming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Price</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>Starts at $299</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) supports most of the same Meta AI features of newer Meta smart glasses, with a few notable exceptions. While you can ask Meta what it sees or hears, it can only process a single audio cue at a time. This means you'll need to ask questions one at a time, while newer Meta glasses support Meta AI live conversation mode.</p><p>The Gen 1's camera quality is also almost as good as the Gen 2's, despite the gulf in resolution offered in recording quality. Pictures are largely identical between generations, but video quality is significantly better on Gen 2s. Gen 1 also has worse video stabilization.</p><p>Battery life is the weakest part of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1). At just 4 hours of maximum battery life per charge, you'll be used to charging these glasses at least once per day. Thankfully, the included charging case makes it easy to top them up on the go, and you'll be able to charge the glasses fully several times over before needing to recharge the case.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d59d18c0-33e3-457a-955e-c4cd86282e55">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:56.25%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TtHvnQ6maDDrxzE4uEUDng.jpg' alt="Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses official product renders"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Style on a budget</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="80" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) packs in excellent speakers and mics, classic Ray-Ban styles, respectably high-res photos, compatibility with Facebook and Instagram for quick sharing, and other perks that make them among the best smart glasses available.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-gen-2"><span>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-display-Meta-Store-4" alt="A display of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses in various styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is the most stylish pair of smart glasses Meta offers today. With over 150 different lens, frame, color, and style combinations, there's almost certainly a pair that'll fit you as an individual.</p><p>It's also a palpable upgrade for some of the lowest-ranking parts of Gen 1. It nearly doubles the battery life, which was the biggest complaint about the Gen 1 glasses. These run the same internal hardware and cameras as Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-battery-life-review">my battery tests there</a> will give you an idea of what to expect.</p><p>TLDR, Gen 2s should take around 60% more photos and video on a single charge than Gen 1s, and that's reason enough to choose them for anyone who wants these for their unique perspective.</p><div ><table><caption>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Style options</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>3 Frames, up to 6 colors per style.

See this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/sBL0acIBb2Y">Oakley Meta HSTN running test</a> video for an idea of what you can expect to see from Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2).</p><p>In addition to the battery and camera upgrades, Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) also adds Meta AI Live conversation mode. When you say, "Hey Meta, go live," the AI will enter conversation mode and be able to see and hear what you see in real-time.</p><p>This is an upgrade over the previous Meta AI functionality on Gen 1 glasses, as you can walk around and have a flowing conversation with Meta AI.

The fit is more snug than Ray-Ban Metas and has a straighter temple design, while Ray-Bans have a curved temple tip that holds on to your ears better.</p><p>If I had to pick one reason to choose Oakley Meta HSTN over Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), it would be for the PRIZM lenses. These specialized polarized lenses offer an extra vibrant color palette for the world while simultaneously blocking harmful UV rays.

Up until now, Meta's glasses were iterations of one another, but Vanguard is where the experience forks a bit. These glasses are made for athletes who plan to record their activities with a more convenient hands-free camera instead of strapping a GoPro to a helmet.</p><p>As such, they have a limited number of style options, don't support prescription lenses, and only come with Oakley PRIZM lenses. You can easily swap out lens colors if you want to buy additional ones, but there's no support for Transitions, polarized, solid color, or clear lenses at this time.</p><p>But what they lack in style, they more than make up for in capability. Oakley Meta Vanguard are the first Meta smart glasses that tie directly into Garmin and Strava, automatically matching up recorded videos with fitness data from these services.

They may look like a thicker version of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer AI glasses, but there's so much more to them, starting with the lenses.</p><p>All Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses come with Transitions lenses as a standard, so you can wear them inside and out all day long. The 6-hour battery life ensures that you can get plenty done before needing to charge, and the handy folding charging case fits in a bag or pocket, making it more convenient than other glasses on this page.</p><p>A transparent display sits inside the right lens, illuminating when needed to show you notifications, apps, and even a camera viewfinder.

The specialized electronics inside understand how human arm and hand muscles work and are used to control the glasses without a controller, touch, or even a camera to see them.</p><p>With this, you can respond to messages by writing on a table (as if you were holding a pen), turn the music volume up and down by rotating an invisible dial, and even flick through Instagram discretely using your thumb.

This simple gadget tracked steps and sleep, and even had a vibration motor inside to alert you to phone notifications. Since then, Amazfit has morphed into a fitness powerhouse, offering dozens of different smartwatches at every price level and functionality you could dream of.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfit-balance-2-impressions">Amazfit Balance 2</a> is my favorite smartwatch from the company in a long time, and its impressive capabilities are only matched by its sleek appearance. Of course, my trusty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Garmin Instinct 2X Solar</a> is still cranking right along, good as the day it came out, and is, quite frankly, hard to beat for most fitness-related tasks.</p><p>I wore both of these watches on my latest Spartan Race and had a difficult time finding any reasonable differences in the data they provided at the end of the race. Which leads me to wonder: why would I pay more for a Garmin than an Amazfit watch? I found a few reasons, and they might help you decide.</p><h2 id="price-2">Price</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XxvAPCFcBu3sAoLjn6BsXg" name="amazfit-balance-2-and-t-rex-3-pro" alt="Holding an Amazfit Balance 2 and Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XxvAPCFcBu3sAoLjn6BsXg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Price is the area where Amazfit wins most handily. Garmin is known for producing high-quality watches that aren't inexpensive, which has given the brand a premium image over the years. Amazfit started from the other end of things, offering dirt-cheap products and upping their game over time (but still undercutting rivals on price).</p><p>Take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-band-7-vs-garmin-vivosmart-5">Amazfit Band 7 vs the Garmin Vivosmart 5</a>, for instance. Both of these are the latest fitness bands with displays from each respective company; yet, Garmin's is still three times the price of Amazfit's. Plus, because of software updates and a fresh Zepp app, some of the shortcomings we found in our original Amazfit Band 7 review have been rectified.</p><p>This same argument can be made for many of Amazfit's products. In many cases, competing Amazfit products offer 90-95% of the features of Garmin's at something like half the price, and that's a ratio I'm willing to work with.</p><h2 id="fitness-tracking-2">Fitness tracking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oD6JyZw7zRkHyEqGoN4Yh5" name="amazfit-balance-2-garmin-instinct-2x-solar-spartan-race" alt="Wearing an Amazfit Balance 2 and a Garmin Instinct 2X Solar smartwatch at a Spartan Race" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oD6JyZw7zRkHyEqGoN4Yh5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For years, Amazfit watches felt like an obvious second-rate choice for fitness tracking. While they have offered more options for workout types — 180 on the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro I just got versus around 90 on the Garmin Instinct 2X I have — I wasn't convinced of the accuracy of the heart rate monitoring until this year's products.</p><p>Both the Amazfit Balance 2 and T-Rex 3 Pro have superb heart rate accuracy, matching all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness smartwatches</a> I've tested to date. I've taken these watches out for paddleboarding sessions, run a Spartan Race with them, and spent plenty of time in my CrossFit-style gym trying out everything from cardio days to strength training.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JM7GTeGptrPd53ZZYtSFkD" name="Garmin-marathon-training-widget" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 on the author's wrist, showing the Primary Race widget with the Garmin Tucson Marathon time, date, weeks until the event, and goal time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JM7GTeGptrPd53ZZYtSFkD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only area I found where Garmin more consistently has the edge over Amazfit is during strength training and weight-lifting exercises. While several Amazfit workout types will give you a breakdown of what muscles you used and keep track of your reps, Garmin more consistently shows the correct workout type automatically.</p><p>For instance, my most common workout type is HIIT since it most closely aligns with my gym's typical activity types. If I look at the data from my Garmin Instinct 2X Solar, it's got muscle heatmaps of what it thinks I used, which is helpful for going back and remembering why my shoulders are suddenly sore two days later.</p><p>Amazfit only offers this kind of muscular heatmap for strength training or weightlifting exercise types. I've also found that Amazfit's watches have a harder time differentiating nuanced workouts than Garmin. If I select strength training and do a bunch of front squats with a barbell, Garmin almost always marks it as "barbell squat," while Amazfit's watches might figure that out 30% of the time.</p><h2 id="companion-apps-and-syncing-2">Companion apps and syncing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xSLJJ6439PYTnz72ZdD9Ao" name="garmin-connect-spartan-race-map" alt="A map of a Spartan Race workout in the Garmin Connect app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xSLJJ6439PYTnz72ZdD9Ao.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's where things get a little mixed. As an app, Amazfit Zepp is superior. It's got a better, less convoluted UI when compared to the Garmin Connect app, and it offers a ton of additional features that Garmin just doesn't have. LLM-powered food logging is probably the greatest single feature I've used in <em>any</em> holistic workout app, and it's something only Zepp has.</p><p>But as good as the Zepp app's features and UI are, it's held back by a number of bugs that are just plain frustrating. Reddit users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amazfit/comments/1khsh4r/amazfit_trex_3_and_active_2_serious_bugs_still/">have complained</a> about this many times, and it often takes Amazfit a long time to address these problems. Coding and workout algorithms are hard, no doubt, but it seems like Amazfit's team isn't able to crank out fixes as fast as some other companies.</p><p>I don't often run into problems with the app, but my original intent for this week's column was to compare data from the Spartan Race I just ran. The problem is, the Amazfit watch had my entire workout on it, but the Zepp app simply wouldn't sync the entire thing.</p><p>This left me with missing workout data when I exported the workout to quantified-self.io, the service we typically use to directly compare smartwatch fitness data. Unfortunately for my original idea, the entire stack of GPS data was missing, and the Zepp app confirmed that.</p><h2 id="holding-amazfit-back-2">Holding Amazfit back</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Nfr2GgBPduxdyWwucN5qF7" name="amazfit-balance-2-amazfit-zepp-app-workouts-02" alt="Looking at workout stats on the Zepp app next to the Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nfr2GgBPduxdyWwucN5qF7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The problem is that there's no way to manually sync fitness data from Amazfit watches or even export from the watch itself.

When Samsung announced the Galaxy Tab S11, it confirmed the flagship supports 5G, but only sub-6 networks, and there is no support for mmWave 5G networks. You'll of course need a carrier connection and plan to use it. It's also worth noting that while Samsung says the Tab S11 supports 5G, there's currently no 5G variant available for purchase in the U.S., though it is offered in other global markets.</p></article></section><h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s-5g-connectivity-2">Everything you need to know about Samsung Galaxy Tab S11's 5G connectivity</h2><p>Like clockwork, Samsung has unveiled its next generation of flagship Android tablets. At this year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-central-best-of-ifa-2025">IFA 2025</a>, the company introduced the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra. This time, Samsung has dropped the Plus model in favor of the standard 11-inch Tab S11. The new Galaxy Tab S11 lineup brings thinner builds, upgraded internals, and One UI 8 (based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>) out of the box.</p><p>Similar to last year's Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Tab S10 Ultra, Samsung has kept 5G connectivity in the Tab S11 series. Both Galaxy Tab S11 and Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra are available in Wi-Fi-only and Wi-Fi + 5G variants globally. This means you can use Wi-Fi for streaming, downloading apps, and gaming, or get the 5G variant to stay connected on the go without relying on a Wi-Fi network.</p><p>Of course, to enjoy 5G on the go, you'll need a separate line or connection for the tablet. Samsung notes that both the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra support physical SIM cards — unlike some phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-esim">Pixel 10 that have gone eSIM-only</a> in the U.S. Optionally, you can also configure an eSIM alongside a physical SIM.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9fbEmVPxfExmLGf2cVYUuW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9fbEmVPxfExmLGf2cVYUuW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for 5G support, the Galaxy Tab S11 does support 5G out of the box, giving you fast speeds for streaming and downloads. However, Samsung specifies that both the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra support only sub-6 5G networks.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-sub-6-better-mmwave-immediate-5g-future">Sub-6 5G</a> means the Tab S11 can connect to networks below 6GHz, offering wider coverage and better penetration. However, speeds are lower than mmWave 5G. It's worth noting that last year's Galaxy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/does-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-support-5g">Tab S10+ offered mmWave 5G</a> support, but this year, Samsung has kept it consistent across the board, with both Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra only offering Sub-6 5G.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another thing to note here is that while Samsung says the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra support 5G globally, as of writing, 5G models do not appear to be available for direct purchase on Samsung's USA website. For now, only Wi-Fi models are available in the U.S., with no official word on whether Samsung plans to bring the 5G models to the States.</p><p>Nevertheless, if you don't wish to spend extra to get 5G or if it's not available in your region, you can always use Wi-Fi to get Internet access on your tablet, whether that's using your home's Wi-Fi network or converting your smartphone, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-color-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 FE</a> or OnePlus 13R, into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-wi-fi-hotspot-android-phone">portable hotspot</a>.

Tempered glass with 9H hardness is the industry standard. Meanwhile, plastic can be TPU, PET, or even hybrid in nature. None of them is right or wrong; it just depends on your usage.</p><p>For most people, the best Samsung Galaxy S25 FE screen protector is one made of tempered glass. The amFilm Auto-Alignment OneTouch for Samsung Galaxy S25 FE Screen Protector 2 Pack is the best overall pick for anyone. This kit includes two pieces of hardy 9H tempered glass screen protectors and camera lens protectors. The lens protectors are made of the same durable glass, but they are dark, which might put some folks off. This set also includes a highly convenient alignment frame that reduces the installation time to barely a minute or two.</p><p>If you want a screen protector set that comes with a clear camera lens protector, the firtstnow 3 Pack Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is better suited for you. While it's not as highly reputed as amFilm, it does have outstanding reviews online. You get three 9H tempered glass screen and lens protectors each. However, there's no installation frame in the box.</p><p>After you're done shopping for shatter-proof and scratch-resistant screen protectors, be sure to grab a shock-, impact-, and drop-resistant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-cases">phone case for your Galaxy S25 FE</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A decent magnetic grip can easily prevent falls and relieve your fingers of repeated stress from holding your phone too long and too frequently. The best part of a magnetic grip is that there's no sticky adhesive — you can pop the grip on and off at any given time.</p><p>The Google Pixelsnap Ring Stand is the best official Pixelsnap-certified accessory for the Pixel 10. It's affordable, functional, and lightweight. You don't need much from a ring holder for your phone to begin with. It's meant to act as a grip and a stand, and the Pixelsnap Ring Stand does both well. If you prefer a more traditional circular phone grip, the PopSockets MagSafe PopGrip in Enamel is a great alternative.</p><p>After you've chosen a decent magnetic phone grip, the next Qi2 accessory to look for is a wireless charger. The Anker MagGo 15W Qi2 Wireless Charger (2-in-1 Stand) also doubles as a phone holder that has a magnetic mount with highly adjustable tilting. You can wirelessly charge your Pixel 10 and prop it up at a comfortable viewing angle at the same time. It's priced very reasonably, too.</p><h2 id="convert-your-pixel-10-into-a-mobile-photography-or-videography-rig-2">Convert your Pixel 10 into a mobile photography or videography rig</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="TXvjR54mk87b7CE3foScbD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-qi2-kraftgeek-justtap-powershutter-mous-qi2-wireless-charging-stand-lifestyle" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro with several magnetic accessories." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TXvjR54mk87b7CE3foScbD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6778" height="3813" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iork6TeHJLnK2Jyr36Kza3" name="google-pixel-10-pro-kraftgeek-powershutter-lifestyle" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro using the KraftGeek PowerShutter magnetic accessory." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iork6TeHJLnK2Jyr36Kza3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3680" height="2070" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3643px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bKY5RYH7Tp4LfqDdvERhah" name="Mous-Charging-Stand-with-Qi2-pixel-10-pro-lifestyle" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro on a magnetic Mous Charging Stand with Qi2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bKY5RYH7Tp4LfqDdvERhah.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3643" height="2049" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Converting your Pixel 10 into a mobile photography or videography rig might sound expensive and intimidating, but Qi2 greatly simplifies things. I have used countless gimbals, tripods, and phone stands over the years, and I hate fumbling with the adjustable arms the most. Clamping your phone into a traditional stand or tripod is super annoying, especially when your phone case is on the thicker side. Luckily, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-quest-for-the-perfect-pixelsnap-accessory-has-ended">KraftGeek JustTap Magnetic Phone Tripod</a> has a magnetic mount.</p><p>The JustTap Tripod is an ingenious way to make the most of your Google Pixel 10's magnetic prowess. All you have to do is slap your phone onto the magnetic mount and set the tripod up — which, by the way, also takes a few short seconds thanks to the "tap to unfold" base mechanism. This tripod is also unbelievably compact and lightweight, with a level of stability and sturdiness that you would not expect from something this light. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a> was very happy atop the magnetic mount, even when I moved the tripod around, adjusted its height, and tested it for sturdiness with jerky movements.</p><p>I highly recommend getting a magnetic light for your Google Pixel 10's cameras. The Ulanzi LM19 Selfie Ring Light has several levels of brightness and temperature adjustability. It's highly compact and charges via USB-C, and you can tilt it thanks to the way it is built. It's a fantastic tool to boost your Pixel 10's photography game.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's the most compact out of the top options from Apple, Samsung, and Google, and it added a third rear camera before it was cool. Now, it's time to see whether the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/deciding-between-iphone-17-models-as-an-android-user-heres-what-to-consider">iPhone 17</a> can beat the Galaxy S25 at its own game in base-model value.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-design-and-display-2">iPhone 17 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3RBqitMnyURP36mpjHDf9Z" name="iPhone-17-Promo" alt="The entire iPhone 17 lineup against a green background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3RBqitMnyURP36mpjHDf9Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 17 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> are both small flagships, but Apple's smartphone is heavier and less compact than Samsung's. It comes down to the displays — Samsung is still using a 6.2-inch AMOLED panel on the Galaxy S25, whereas Apple moved to a larger 6.3-inch screen. Both are now capable of hitting 120Hz refresh rates, and have AOD options.</p><p>Apple is using Ceramic Shield 2 glass on the iPhone 17, and Samsung opted for Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the Galaxy S25. Both are made by Corning, but the key difference is that the iPhone 17's cover glass is optimized for scratch protection and has anti-reflective properties. To get an anti-reflective screen on a Samsung Galaxy phone, you have to go with the expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rtZzxZhZ9PuvR2NWJrUq8N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-6" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rtZzxZhZ9PuvR2NWJrUq8N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's hard to understate the difference in size between the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25. By just comparing the screen sizes, the gap looks minuscule, but there's more to the story. The iPhone measures 149.6 x 71.5 x 8mm and weighs 177 grams, which is larger by every measure compared to the Galaxy S25's dimensions of 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm. The Samsung base model's weight is particularly impressive at just 162 grams — even lighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/exclusive-apples-big-bet-and-its-not-the-iphone-air">iPhone Air</a>.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Galaxy S25 packs flagship specs and a larger battery capacity than the iPhone 17 in that small form factor. The only key compromise here is the display, which is smaller by one tenth of an inch. Only you can decide whether the bigger, thicker, and heavier design of the iPhone 17 is a dealbreaker, but I prefer the compact and lightweight build of the Galaxy S25.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bTxp5zAdUrnu6DCKh6GVRg" name="iphone-17-colors" alt="iPhone 17 color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bTxp5zAdUrnu6DCKh6GVRg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for durability, both phones sport an IP68 certification against dust and water ingress.

It's powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> mobile platform, the same one that powers Samsung's most expensive handsets. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 runs on an Apple A19 chip that's a lower-tier offering compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apples-a19-pro-throws-down-the-gauntlet-for-qualcomm-and-mediatek">A19 Pro</a> in the Air and Pro models. This could help the Galaxy S25 excel in AI tasks and gaming, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Samsung has the advantage in on-device memory, with 12GB of RAM on the Galaxy S25 compared to the iPhone 17's 8GB. However, the iPhone 17 crucially starts with 256GB of base storage at the same price as the 128GB Galaxy S25. There's more storage available on the higher-end configurations, too. You can buy an iPhone 17 with up to 512GB of storage, while the Galaxy S25 tops out at 256GB.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Apple iPhone 17</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>iOS 26</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch, Super Retina XDR OLED, 120Hz, 1206 x 2622, Ceramic Shield 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td><td  ><p>6.2-inch, Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, Corning Gorilla Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Apple A19</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 48MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, f/1.8 main sensor + 12MP, f/2.2 ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view + 12MP, f/2.2 telephoto with 3x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>18MP</p></td><td  ><p>12MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, <strong>eSIM only</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Face ID</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>3,692 mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>40W-60W USB-C fast charging</p><p>25W MagSafe Qi2 wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions and weight</p></td><td  ><p>149.6 x 71.5 x 8mm; 177g</p></td><td  ><p>146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm; 162g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Black, White, Mist Blue, Sage, Lavender</p></td><td  ><p>Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow (Coralred, Blueblack, and Pinkgold only at Samsung)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In terms of connectivity, the iPhone 17 and the Galaxy S25 both support Wi-Fi 7, 5G, satellite connectivity, and NFC.

The practical benefit of this change is being able to take selfies in either orientation, portrait or landscape, without having to physically rotate your phone. And when there's a big group shot, Center Stage uses AI to automatically expand the view to fit everyone in.</p><p>The rear cameras are a bit less exciting — they're 48MP sensors, a main and an ultrawide.

However, both also stand out in their own way. Aside from the obvious iOS 26 vs. One UI 7 debate, these phones focus on completely different things.</p><p>The iPhone 17 clearly puts an emphasis on the cameras, making it a great option for creators or anyone who loves to take photos or videos. Yes, it has one fewer rear camera than the Galaxy S25, but its 48MP main and ultrawide cameras are top-notch. Plus, the square front-facing camera that makes it possible to capture vertical or horizontal selfies without rotating your device is a standout feature.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 has more raw power with the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, and it does more with it thanks to Galaxy AI and Gemini. It'll run circles around Apple Intelligence, and the smarts may even help the phone beat the iPhone 17 in gaming and intensive tasks.</p><p>You can't go wrong with either one, but if you happen to care about camera or AI features, you may want to pick the iPhone 17 or Galaxy S25, respectively.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8700225f-d3fb-405c-b2a6-5f513ad68d58">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DUzL8NRPma6QXXkxvxnLYU.jpg' alt="iPhone 17 render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">iPhone 17</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>For the cameras</strong></em></p><p>Android users might notice that the iPhone 17 stands out as a camera-focused flagship.

And while I haven't jumped on the smart glasses train just yet, the new offerings from Meta have me really excited about this growing category.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung is rumored to have its own AI glasses in the works, which could launch as soon as October alongside the more powerful Project Moohan XR headset. These have a lot of potential, especially as the first real competitors to the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2). However, with the latest generation being Meta's third attempt at smart glasses, Samsung and Google will have to play catch-up on both hardware and software to make up for lost time.</p><h2 id="all-the-right-upgrades-2">All the right upgrades</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gQXWdYtLYGtX6voW4eBceC" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen 2-Shiny-Cosmic-Blue-Transitions" alt="The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gQXWdYtLYGtX6voW4eBceC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7680" height="4320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's only been the last few years that smart glasses started taking off, and that's largely thanks to Meta. In 2021, it seemed a little strange that Meta was diving into this unproven market, but the popularity of the last-gen Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses proved that this is a winning category for the company.</p><p>Admittedly, Meta's last-gen model was the first time I was even remotely interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>. I was impressed with how they're able to identify what was in front of me while looking like something anyone could wear, unlike the early attempts of Google Glass.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were some downsides to the glasses, with the main thing being battery life. This was admittedly the biggest reason why I hadn't pulled the trigger on buying them, but Gen 2 fortunately appears to have addressed this.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hLZZgrhjS9KfTFuhbzSY6Y" name="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-official-lifestyle-03" alt="An official lifestyle photo of a person wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hLZZgrhjS9KfTFuhbzSY6Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is estimated to last up to eight hours on a single charge with mixed use. This feels perfectly sufficient for something like these, which I likely won't be using constantly aside from the occasional question, listening to music, and taking a photo or video here and there.</p><p>Meta also upped the video capture capabilities to a 3K resolution. As someone who loves to capture videos to post on my Instagram stories or Reels, this is a great upgrade. I'll likely stick to 1080p, because frankly, I don't think anything beyond that is necessary for social media, but having the option is nice.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-smart-glasses-could-be-just-as-compelling-2">Samsung's smart glasses could be just as compelling</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fLhUdnX3ScDaV7rvFNn6W3" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-vs-google-smart-glasses-sameer-teaser" alt="Android president Sameer Samat wearing Google's upcoming smart glasses with a picture of Android Central's Nick Sutrich wearing Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fLhUdnX3ScDaV7rvFNn6W3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screen captures from The Android Show I/O Edition 2025)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've heard and seen a lot regarding Samsung's Project Moohan and Google's Android XR ambitions, but we haven't heard as much about Samsung's rumored Ray-Ban Meta competitors. It has been reported that the glasses, dubbed Project Haean, could launch with the aptly named "Samsung Galaxy Glasses" moniker and would be audio-only, featuring a camera and quick access to AI assistants.</p><p>This already sounds quite compelling to me, as Samsung has put much of its focus lately on Gemini, which is becoming a staple in my life. Gemini's more natural conversational skills, as well as features like Gemini Live, which can easily identify what it sees and even remember things for you, would fit extremely well on a pair of smart glasses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1578px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hhWtJ4NipS5AKMv6WCPJ9M" name="Samsung and Google partnership for Android XR headsets and glasses" alt="Samsung and Google partnership for Android XR headsets and glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hhWtJ4NipS5AKMv6WCPJ9M.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1578" height="888" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This could also give the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) a run for its money, as Samsung and Google have the ecosystem to back up Gemini's capabilities. On the one hand, Meta's services have become fairly ubiquitous, with apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp installed on hundreds of millions of smartphones, not to mention Meta AI injected into these apps (whether we like it or not). This, along with the growing popularity of Meta's glasses, gives it a good amount of mindshare among consumers.</p><p>On the other hand, Google and Samsung have been pushing Gemini's capabilities on their phones and other devices. Look at any Pixel 10 commercial and you'll see how the focus is less on the phone and more on what Gemini can do for you in your everyday life. This type of marketing is admittedly quite effective, and I imagine this would translate extremely well with Android XR glasses.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-XbeLZag-k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>There's also the fact that these glasses would likely have a deeper connection with Android phones than Meta's do, which is another differentiating factor that could play in Samsung's favor. Imagine getting real-time Maps directions, creating new events in Calendar, or translating a conversation with Google Translate, all without taking out your phone.</p><p>Hands-free access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-might-use-an-iphone-but-i-cant-live-without-these-google-apps">your favorite Google apps</a> could be a huge draw over Meta.</p><h2 id="another-galaxy-ring-situation-2">Another Galaxy Ring situation?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rv3YWmGshEhegzmAfo7UJ7" name="google-glasses-ted-2025-demo-nishtha-shatia-02" alt="Samsung Project HAEAN Android XR glasses being shown off at TED 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rv3YWmGshEhegzmAfo7UJ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gilberto Tadday / TED)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Samsung wants its "Galaxy Glasses" to succeed, it's going to have to do more than rely on its name to generate sales. We're seeing Samsung dive into new product categories lately with devices like the Galaxy Ring, and while it was a valiant effort to supplant a growing market, it's still an expensive product that feels a bit like an also-ran to the Oura Ring.</p><p>Samsung will have to create a rather compelling case for why people should buy smart glasses <em>and </em>why they should choose it over Meta. For that to happen, Samsung will have to get three things right:</p><ul><li><strong>Design</strong>: They can't <em>look </em>like smart glasses if they expect people to wear them. They should also have multiple styles/colors.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>: Samsung hasn't always excelled in this spec, and it will have to really squeeze as much battery as it can to make them useful.</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: If they're too expensive, Samsung might as well throw in the towel to Meta.</li></ul><p>Availability is also a concern. Rumors point to a reveal of the Galaxy Glasses in October, while some indications point to a 2026 launch, which could mean even more time for Meta's glasses to hold the spotlight.</p><p>On the plus side, Google's work on Gemini has put it in a good place for integrating into smart glasses, meaning the glasses should be plenty capable. If Samsung can nail everything else above, it could properly challenge Meta's growing lineup of AI glasses and push the market further into the mainstream.</p> ]]></dc:content>
