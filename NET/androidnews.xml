                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I'm a certified audio nerd, but I'll readily admit that you don't need to spend a fortune to get great audio products in 2025. Sometimes the best and most expensive gear isn't actually ideal for every situation. I've said that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/everyone-needs-3-pairs-of-wireless-headphones-here-are-my-picks">everyone needs three pairs of wireless headphones</a>,  and similar is true for Bluetooth speakers. If you're building out your audio setup, Amazon is selling one of the best waterproof speakers from JBL at a major discount.</p><p>I own and use the JBL Go 3, a tiny Bluetooth speaker with IP67 dust and water-resistance. It hits all the major needs of a portable speaker, including a built-in lanyard loop, five-hour battery life, and a USB-C port for easy charging. That's all for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KW1KR5H" target="_blank"><strong>just $27.95 with Prime Day sales,</strong></a><strong> </strong>down from $39.95.</p><p>But the deal won't be here for long, so if you're interested, you need to act fast.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5bec8970-bcdd-407a-ac8c-32e41fd00cf5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$39.95" data-dimension48="$39.95" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KW1KR5H" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="7L7itM2Whx8FGs7H2yLYRG" name="jbl-go-3.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7L7itM2Whx8FGs7H2yLYRG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>JBL Go 3:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KW1KR5H" target="_blank" data-dimension112="5bec8970-bcdd-407a-ac8c-32e41fd00cf5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$39.95" data-dimension48="$39.95" data-dimension25=""><del>$39.95</del><strong> $27.95 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Want louder volume and better sound quality than your phone speakers, while prioritizing portability and durability? The JBL Go 3 checks all those boxes, offering IP67 water and dust-resistance, a tiny form factor with a built-in lanyard loop, and solid sound. At under $30 for Prime Big Deal Days, you're getting a superb wireless speaker at an even better price. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KW1KR5H" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5bec8970-bcdd-407a-ac8c-32e41fd00cf5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$39.95" data-dimension48="$39.95" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need a small Bluetooth speaker for outdoor activities; you want a speaker that'll survive water and sand; you have a tiny budget but still want decent sound quality.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you'd rather pay more for a bigger speaker; you need longer battery life; you want a different color (only black is currently on sale).</p><h2 id="here-s-why-i-use-the-jbl-go-3-and-you-should-too-2">Here's why I use the JBL Go 3 — and you should too</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4hrn86vWUVcNNCyyqvkyad" name="JBL-Go-3-2" alt="The JBL Go 3 speaker on a drum." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4hrn86vWUVcNNCyyqvkyad.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm a big fan of JBL audio, and have invested quite a bit of my own cash in the company's gear. I use a pair of JBL Stage 2 bookshelf speakers for my vinyl record setup, and have owned various models of the brand's Go, Clip, Flip, Charge, and Pulse wireless portable speakers. After trying them all, I find myself coming back to the Go 3 for its size and affordability.</p><p>It's the smallest of JBL's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">portable Bluetooth speakers</a>, and that means it won't sound as loud or as crisp as bigger and more-expensive models. However, this is meant to be a cheap and durable speaker that can survive bike rides, runs, or beach and pool trips with ease. It can fit in a pocket or be easily clipped onto a bag or electric scooter, making the Go 3 a portability champion.</p><p>As the name suggests, the JBL Go 3 is a Bluetooth speaker designed to be used on-the-go, and it's incredibly handy for doing just that. I'd recommend it for use as a beach or pool speaker, or even for runners and hikers — it's small enough to comfortably fit in the palm of your hand. With Bluetooth 5.1 support, it'll pair great with any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">modern Android phone</a>, and many more Bluetooth-equipped devices.</p><p>For those who want something just a bit better and more durable than their smartphone, the JBL Go 3 is a standout option, especially when it's under $30. Amazon says this deal will only be live until around midnight PT, so don't wait too long or you'll miss it.</p><h2 id="october-prime-day-quick-links-2">October Prime Day - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

But this time around, the "Plus" model was skipped over.</p><p>On the bright side, the Tab S10 Plus is still getting basically all of the new software features that Samsung introduced. Really, the only thing you aren't getting is the newly redesigned S Pen that Samsung includes with both the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Spotify in ChatGPT is rolling out for the app, and the company states you will need to connect your account during your first prompt. Users with free or Premium accounts can take advantage of the AI's assistance with Spotify, though each tier has varying capabilities.</p><p>Users on the Free tier of Spotify can lean on ChatGPT to access the service's music in Discover Weekly and New Music Friday playlists that are updated on their respective days (Monday and Friday). Spotify Premium users in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-android-app-launch">ChatGPT app</a> can do more, like "collaborating" with the AI to create whole new playlists.</p><p>Spotify states users can ask the AI to create a playlist that fits a specific theme, mood, or topic. If you know what you're looking for, such as a genre of music, you can just use that. On a related note, the AI can lean on Spotify's music library for users asking about new music from their favorite artists.</p><p>Whatever you ask ChatGPT to do, whether it's surfacing a certain selection of playlists or asking it to create a playlist full of popular Latin artists, it will surface Spotify's results in the app. Users will see what resembles a Spotify widget in the app. The post states users can tap individual tracks, which will toss them into the Spotify app. However, if you've asked ChatGPT to create a new playlist for you, there will be an "Open in Spotify" option, so you can see everything as it is in the app.</p><h2 id="spotify-in-ai-2">Spotify in AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="mPd3b4VhMPWt8fuWu8Y2Wm" name="spotify-chatgpt-prompt-example" alt="Spotify in ChatGPT lets users link the music platform to the AI app, enabling playlist creation, recommendations, new music ideas, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mPd3b4VhMPWt8fuWu8Y2Wm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the ChatGPT app, the post states free, Plus, and Pro accounts can utilize Spotify, so long as they're signed in. This feature is reportedly arriving in over 145 countries this week on Android and iOS.</p><p>It seems fitting that Spotify would lend its musical knowledge to OpenAI's ChatGPT app, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-spotify-extension-rollout-detailed">it did the same thing</a> with Google's Gemini. Those on Android using Gemini can find a Spotify extension, which lets the AI dive into Spotify to try and satisfy the query at hand (there's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-youtube-music-extension-rollout">also an extension</a> for YouTube Music). In the Gemini app, users can tell the AI to play a specific album, playlist, or ask it to play a song by a specific artist.</p><p>On a grander note, Spotify finally (finally) launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-lossless-listening-premium-subscribers-hear-every-refined-note-launch">Lossless Listening</a> feature for Premium subscribers in September. While the music you'll hear will be more refined and rich, Lossless Listening comes at the cost of siphoning even more data, so it's worth expressing caution if you're not listening on a Wi-Fi connection. Lossless Listening is available in private playlists and Liked Songs, as well as DJ, Jam, Mix, AI Playlists, and Daylists.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Problem is, Google has made the Pixel Watch 3 so darn cheap — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D9138ZXM"><strong>$170.99 at Amazon (32% off)</strong></a> — that anyone weighing the Pixel Watch 4 at $349 might reasonably decide to grab the cheaper model for half the price!</p><p>The largest savings come from grabbing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D94NBL6F"><strong>45mm Pixel Watch LTE for $284 ($115 off)</strong></a> for a larger display and standalone cellular support, instead of paying $499 for the Watch 4 45mm LTE.

Their sale is so good that you don't have to wait until Black Friday to snag that phone or tablet you've been eyeing for a while! This means even the new Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, which just launched a month ago, is also seeing a massive price drop, so be sure to grab this<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1V92LT?th=1"> <strong>$150 off deal</strong></a> now!</p><p>The Galaxy S25 FE prides itself as being a device that comes baked with the stable version of One UI 8, even before it landed on the flagship Galaxy S25 series, which is pretty neat as you get the latest UI right out of the box! The device features a large 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a 120Hz refresh rate. And you also get thinner bezels, which means more screen space to binge on your favorite shows or games.</p><p>While the device is the same size as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>, which means it's bigger than the standard Galaxy S25, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-hands-on">is the slimmest and lightest FE phone from Samsung ever,</a> measuring just 7.4mm thin and weighing 190 grams.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><strong>Prime Day is BACK October 7th and 8th - see the full list of deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="16aaeafb-a81d-4884-91ff-6347aa27ebb9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$649.99" data-dimension48="$649.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1V92LT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1133px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="WCq9VRVaWyw99hnrXeEhMN" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in Icyblue" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WCq9VRVaWyw99hnrXeEhMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1133" height="1133" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1V92LT?th=1" data-dimension112="16aaeafb-a81d-4884-91ff-6347aa27ebb9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$649.99" data-dimension48="$649.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$649.99</del></a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1V92LT?th=1"><strong>499.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE sports an upgraded chipset, a sleeker design, and a bigger battery with faster charging.

The thing that I really appreciate is the upgraded Exynos 2400 chipset, which keeps the device running smoothly for those long hours of doomscrolling, gaming, or streaming shows.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/kindle/color-meets-the-kindle-scribe-amazon-redesigned-ereader-and-notebook">new Kindle Scribes</a> offer a slightly larger 11-inch display that's said to be more responsive, and a quad-core processor that helps make things even snappier.</p><p>The existing Kindle Scribe model has great response time for its pen — one of the lowest-latency pens on the entire market, in fact — but the dual-core processor means it's a bit limited on power. Amazon also upgraded the E Ink display on the new units, improving the refresh rate and adding a color option (which costs even more, by the way).</p><p>The new Scribes come with 32gb or 64GB of storage, while the 2024 model offers a 16GB option for less. If you don't plan on filling it up with a bunch of apps, that 16GB model is just fine.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5jGLPvBh6GbbpU6qxdWXe4" name="amazon-kindle-scribe-2024-lifestyle-render.jpg" alt="Amazon Kindle Scribe 2024 lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5jGLPvBh6GbbpU6qxdWXe4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's, of course, thinner and lighter than the old model too, but I think that's where the big improvements stop. The new 2025 Kindle Scribe features smaller, uniform bezels, but I personally don't want that in a digital notebook.</p><p>I love the large side bezel of the Kindle Scribe models on sale because it provides a comfortable place to hold the tablet while writing.

Both speakers are about the same size and boast similar faux leather designs with metal grills. Even the button and battery bar placements are nearly identical.</p><p>What's different about the Edifier ES20 is that it has built-in RGB lights that have several modes. You can keep the lighting steady or change it to other dynamic presets, including one for emergencies. There's a dedicated button to control the light presets.</p><p>The Edifier ES20 portable Bluetooth speaker has a 15-hour battery life and charges via USB-C. You miss out on fast charging, which is a bummer, but it's not uncommon in this price segment. There are also various audio modes which can be changed via the appropriate button.</p><p>And, of course, you get an even more granular level of control over the lights and audio settings via the Edifier ConneX mobile app.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

When cellular connectivity drops during a disaster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-outage-hurricane-helene-showcase-importance-of-satellite-connectivity">like it did on the Verizon network during Hurricane Helene in 2024</a>, it can impact people in need, first responder communications, and slow relief efforts. Roughly a year after the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene, I got a firsthand look at how Verizon responds to tragedies nationwide and keeps cell service active.</p><p>There's a team within <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a> that you might not have heard of called Verizon Frontline. Its purpose isn't to sell you cell phone plans or offer you a trade-in deal, but rather to develop and deploy assets that can help first responders in emergency situations. It's a collaborative effort between government agencies and the Frontline team to share technologies first responders didn't know they needed, and create assets first responders think would be helpful.</p><p>That includes emerging technologies you might not expect to be useful during a disaster, such as AI, robotic dogs, drones, and more.</p><h2 id="new-problems-for-disaster-relief-2">New problems for disaster relief </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qDzpfWvXjmmFVDnBRazEPZ" name="Verizon-Frontline-Truck-1" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qDzpfWvXjmmFVDnBRazEPZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Climate change is forcing emergency management departments and carrier teams like Verizon Frontline to adjust. Previously, there were narrower locations and seasons where you might expect disasters like hurricanes, wildfires, or tornadoes to strike. The situation is different now, with hurricanes striking in areas not prepared for them, and wildfire season in some areas of the U.S. becoming year-round.</p><p>This partly explains why Hurricane Helene was so devastating in states like North Carolina and Tennessee. In that instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/is-verizon-down-for-you-youre-not-alone">a major Verizon outage coincided with relief efforts</a> that appeared unrelated to the hurricane itself. These situations are where Verizon Frontline aims to fill the gap — this team within the carrier has over 600 mobile assets scattered nationwide that can sprout temporary networks and connectivity in an emergency.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KZJtbeMUUYmRZrYsriqJ4U" name="Verizon-Frontline-Large-Trailer-1" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KZJtbeMUUYmRZrYsriqJ4U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One type of asset, called the Satellite Pico-cell on Trailer (SPOT), can be set up in roughly an hour and offers a few different ways of getting people online. The trailer supports multiple low-earth orbit satellite connectivity options, including Verizon's own satellites and Starlink. After the initial setup process, it can support up to 128 simultaneous users over Wi-Fi and also broadcasts cellular service over the Verizon network.</p><p>The small and versatile form factor of the SPOT allows it to be deployed almost anywhere and run for three days on its own power, thanks to a 30-gallon diesel fuel tank.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9eEk2KSUFXf6uYCrhByFzX" name="Verizon-Frontline-Small-Trailer-1" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9eEk2KSUFXf6uYCrhByFzX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All the Verizon Frontline equipment I saw firsthand prioritizes redundancy, whether it's a small asset like the Rapid Response Connectivity Unit (RRCU) pictured above or a full-fledged trailer. The RRCU, despite being much smaller than the SPOT and quicker to deploy, can still broadcast Wi-Fi and cell signals in areas where traditional towers are unreachable.</p><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-outage-hurricane-helene-showcase-importance-of-satellite-connectivity">we covered Hurricane Helene</a>, we emphasized the importance of satellite connectivity. It's unsurprising that Verizon Frontline is trusting LEO satellite connectivity to power many of its assets, but the implementation is clever. Aside from the larger trailers, the company is also putting satellite internet dishes and receivers on things you wouldn't expect, like off-road vehicles and robot dogs.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Since it's remote-controlled by an operator and doesn't require line-of-sight vision to use, it can go places first responders can't in an emergency.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EGK84Aby6ZDf7LAMWmRg3c" name="Verizon-Frontline-Dog-5" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EGK84Aby6ZDf7LAMWmRg3c.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ga98UAyfXQuVF4s5EhhtvS" name="Verizon-Frontline-Dog-1" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ga98UAyfXQuVF4s5EhhtvS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FfgUyzeR4op29mQwiU6JQc" name="Verizon-Frontline-Dog-3" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FfgUyzeR4op29mQwiU6JQc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CqqeUMnDtJp5c9X5frn8ZH" name="Verizon-Frontline-Dog-2" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CqqeUMnDtJp5c9X5frn8ZH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L3Lw846tdL77VZeuskM7SC" name="Verizon-Frontline-Dog-4" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3Lw846tdL77VZeuskM7SC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Like the Verizon Frontline drones, both of these kinds of assets help first responders gain visibility in tricky situations.

Currently, I'm keeping an iPhone Air in my left pocket and a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in my right pocket, and the latter has been my daily driver for months. Whatever your stance on thin-and-light smartphones is, a common criticism has been their pricing. It's hard to pay a premium when there are considerable compromises, but now you don't have to thanks to killer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays">Amazon Prime Big Deal Days</a> sales.</p><p>I paid for both my iPhone Air ($1,199) and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge ($1,099) in full, and I regret to inform you that the Galaxy S25 Edge is now at a painfully-low price. My loss is your gain: you can snag a 256GB Galaxy S25 Edge for only $684.99, down from a full retail price of $1,099. To put that in perspective, the discount is over $400 and 38% off, and it's literally lower than the MSRP of a base-model Galaxy S25.</p><p>In other words, if you've been cautiously intrigued by thin phones like the Galaxy S25 Edge, this is your chance to snag one at a major discount with no strings attached — here's why you should.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>October Prime Day is LIVE - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="769257a5-8b01-405f-9169-6cd9fc4efe39" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVPJ5KD/r" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="4R8Syy78oyWM3AN6qWAwGf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-official-render-titanium-silver" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4R8Syy78oyWM3AN6qWAwGf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVPJ5KD/r" target="_blank" data-dimension112="769257a5-8b01-405f-9169-6cd9fc4efe39" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,099.99</del> <strong>$684.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review" target="_blank"><strong>Android Central rating: ⭐⭐⭐</strong>⭐</a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is the most versatile slim phone on the market today. It's the same exact screen size as the Galaxy S25 Plus, and still packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and two rear cameras.

The bit of extra thinness, smaller form factor, and interesting camera plateau design makes the Air feel more exciting and different to me. However, I'm well aware that all of those reasons are also reasons why the average consumer probably shouldn't buy one.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> manages to get pretty thin at 5.8mm without feeling much different from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android smartphone</a>. It still has a premium AMOLED 6.7-inch display, the best Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, and a dual-camera system on the back. In my performance and benchmark testing, I've found that the Galaxy S25 Edge is not only faster than the iPhone Air, but also handles thermal throttling and overheating better.</p><p>With One UI 7 out of the box (and upgradeable to One UI 8), the Galaxy S25 Edge isn't lacking in the software department. I won't tell you whether One UI 8 is better than iOS 26 — that's subjective, and Liquid Glass is controversial — but it's my favorite Android skin from Samsung and comes with seven years of guaranteed software updates.</p><p>The cameras are another separator. I think both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> and Galaxy S25 Edge have great main cameras, but Samsung's thin phone crucially adds an ultrawide lens. Just before I picked up my iPhone Air, I used the ultrawide lens on the Galaxy S25 Edge to take a wide shot at a concert, and realized just how important that secondary camera can be. While there's no telephoto on either, both have 2x "optical-quality" zoom, so Samsung's offering actually has 0.6x, 1x, and 2x options — superb for a slim device.</p><p>Overall, it's clear to me that the Galaxy S25 Edge is the more versatile device. At under $700 for a limited time during Prime Day, it's a no-brainer if you're even remotely excited by slim hardware. It's far less than I paid, and I'm quite happy with my purchase, so your deal will be even better.</p><h2 id="october-prime-day-quick-links-7">October Prime Day - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

And with deals like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AYANEO-Pocket-Android-Handheld-Gaming/dp/B0DTV4YLPP/"><strong>saving $150 on the AYANEO Pocket S</strong></a>, you get a flagship gaming experience without too much compromise.</p><p>What helps separate the Pocket S from the pack is simply the design. It's a slim and modern handheld, giving off some serious Apple vibes thanks to the aluminum and glass combination.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="AYANEO Pocket S: $599" data-dimension48="AYANEO Pocket S: $599" href="https://www.amazon.com/AYANEO-Pocket-Android-Handheld-Gaming/dp/B0DTV4YLPP/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="nXoBXdywrX6qRpSTRuEBEY" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-product-block.png" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nXoBXdywrX6qRpSTRuEBEY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>AYANEO Pocket S: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/AYANEO-Pocket-Android-Handheld-Gaming/dp/B0DTV4YLPP/" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="AYANEO Pocket S: $599" data-dimension48="AYANEO Pocket S: $599" data-dimension25=""><del>$599</del> <strong>$449 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>If you're looking for a premium Android gaming handheld, it really doesn't get much better than the AYANEO Pocket S. It might not be the most powerful handheld, but it'll still easily manage pretty much anything you can throw at it.</p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a premium Android gaming experience, and don't mind not having the latest and greatest specs.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You prefer devices with OLED displays, better ergonomics, or are waiting for either the AYN Odin 3 or KONKR Pocket FIT.</p><p>After being announced in late 2023, the Pocket S finally arrived in June 2024. It's available in several different configurations, with this deal specifically being for the 12GB/128GB model in the Retro Power colorway.</p><p>That's part of what makes this deal so enticing, as AYANEO's Retro Power colorway is usually highly sought after and difficult to acquire. This has been a continuing trend for years, including the upcoming dual-screen AYANEO Pocket DS, which shares the same chip as the Pocket S.</p><p>Since reviewing the Pocket S, it remains a staple in my arsenal of Android gaming handhelds, as the premium design is genuinely enjoyable to use. If anything, my biggest complaint is that I wish the ergonomics were a bit better, but AYANEO does offer a grip case that alleviates some of those issues.</p><p>In the event that you <em>really </em>want handheld with better ergonomics and an OLED panel, the AYANEO Pocket EVO is also on sale. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AYANEO-Pocket-Android-Handheld-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FHVKTJ3F/">8GB/128GB model is down to $429</a>, which is even less than what the Pocket S is going for.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Audio accessories like Bluetooth speakers and headphones for your PlayStation 5 might be on the list. I'm here to tell you to save your money and spend some spare pocket change on something better.</p><p>Sony doesn't allow you to connect any first-party or third-party audio accessories to the PS5 via the console's Bluetooth. There's actually a good reason for that, but more on that later. The most crucial bit of information is this: you don't need to splurge hundreds of dollars just to get a dedicated Bluetooth speaker or pair of headphones that'll rely on an adapter or cable anyway!</p><p>Instead, you can get the UGREEN USB-C Bluetooth Adapter for PS5 and use any of your existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speakers</a>, headphones, or earbuds with your PlayStation 5. It doesn't even reduce the audio quality, because this super affordable dongle has the latest specifications that allow for high-quality audio playback. You can get it for even cheaper with this Prime Big Deal Days offer, saving you $8.40 so you can grab the dongle for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7CKV1J8/"><strong>$21.59 at Amazon</strong></a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="fdbcd0bb-b0b8-43cc-bd76-56de90722445" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="UGREEN USB-C Bluetooth Adapter for PS5 📺The UGREEN USB-C Bluetooth Adapter for PS5 is a simple bridge between your PlayStation 5 and all your Bluetooth speakers and headphones.

The answer can be found on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.ie/electronics/support/articles/00302454">Sony's own support forum</a>.</p><div><blockquote><p>Well, the reason the PS5 doesn’t support Bluetooth Audio connections is because of possible latency performance and bandwidth. Bluetooth is a wonderful technology with an ever-increasing potential, but it currently comes with important limitations when gaming.</p></blockquote></div><div><blockquote><p>As your wireless controller connects through Bluetooth to the PS5, it already takes up Bluetooth bandwidth, and adding wireless audio might lead to minute audio delays, impacting your gaming experience. The same applies to Bluetooth speakers. That’s why gaming headsets such as the Sony INZONE models use a USB dongle (or are wired).</p></blockquote></div><p>As frustrating as it may sound, wired headphones aren't always an option. Not everyone has a pair, and not everyone is looking to buy one just to use with their gaming console. I found myself in this conundrum, wishing to use the spectacular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/four-months-with-the-marshall-kilburn-iii">Marshall Kilburn III</a> with the PS5.</p><p>Sony recommends Bluetooth adapters, and I was looking for a quick solution. That's when I came upon this excellent dongle from UGREEN. The price is too good to pass on, even without the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days discount.</p><p>The UGREEN USB-C Bluetooth Adapter for PS5 is stupidly easy to set up and use. I was skeptic at first, I'm not going to lie, but the product worked just as smoothly as advertised. I highly recommend investing in one of these if you're in the same fix as I was.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Despite their age, the Sony WH-1000XM4 have all of these traits in spades, with customizable ANC (active noise cancellation) and a bunch of EQ settings that you can personalize directly from the companion Sony app. </p><p>I generally wear these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">noise-cancelling headphones</a> for the majority of my workday, so I can confirm that the ANC has successfully blocked out the sound of lawn mowers, traffic, and my partner's own work calls. Sony quotes up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, and I can also verify that I generally only have to charge the XM4 about once per week.</p><p>The sound quality delivered by the Sony XM4 is immersive and balanced too, as I have used these cans for everything from acoustic folk and death metal albums to staff meetings and Red Dead Redemption 2. </p><p>Sure, there are newer models to consider — and both the XM5 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">XM6</a> might be better wireless headphones overall — but for me, the Sony WH-1000XM4 hit that sweet spot. If you can afford them, go with the newer generations of Sony headphones, but if you're looking to save some cash this Prime Day, this is easily my favorite headphones deal of them all.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-quick-links-2">Prime Big Deal Days - Quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Deal hunters are skipping the smaller discounts and going for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YNVD88"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 at $149.99</strong></a>, an all-time low according to Camelcamelcamel, and you can bet stock will run out before Prime Day ends.</p><p>I've been covering Samsung deals for years, so I know that last year on Black Friday, the Galaxy Watch 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-6-hits-all-time-low-week-before-black-friday-2024">bottomed out at $149</a> before Samsung sold off its stock for good and pivoted to the Watch 7.

That doesn't mean you <em>should</em> buy it if you prefer a watch with weeks of battery life or a more Classic look, but be prepared to spend a lot more for it.</p><p>The fact is, comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 8 vs. Watch 7</a> shows the two devices aren't that different, aside from Samsung's new "Cushion Design" that makes it skinnier and flatter against your wrist, but also throws away the normal circular look. Considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Coaching-Tracking/dp/B0F7QD4HSD"><strong>Watch 8 is $314 (10% off)</strong></a>, it's easy to argue that it's worth saving another $165 for the Watch 7 instead.</p><p>Truly, if you look at the other last-generation Android watches on sale today like the Pixel Watch 3 ($229) and OnePlus Watch 2 ($227), it's pretty amazing that the Galaxy Watch 7 is so much cheaper when it's arguably the best of the bunch. It's due to receive more software support, and its One UI Watch build has smooth software and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-galaxy-watch-8-tiles-are-best-part-of-one-ui-8-watch">best Tiles</a> of any Wear OS watch.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Thankfully, three universally-loved BoboVR headstraps are on sale for Prime Day, with the classic style coming in at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJLG9SBR"><strong>an incredible $39.99</strong></a> out the door. This sale ends October 8, 2025, so be sure to jump on the deal ASAP before it's gone!</p><p>BoboVR's headstraps are stupid comfortable and all come with a brilliant hot-swappable, magnetically detachable, rechargeable battery pack that'll add about 2 hours to your headset's playtime. Since you can hot-swap these, it's easy to grab a few additional batteries and lengthen your sessions, or just drop a battery on if you somehow forgot to keep your headset charged.</p><p>All three of these amazing headstraps <strong>will work on a Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S</strong>. Here's how to choose between the three options this Prime Day:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><strong>Prime Day is BACK October 7th and 8th - see the full list of deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="48b8cedc-8551-4c18-aa13-b847dab8549a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="🔋 - BoboVR charger + extra battery: $39.99" data-dimension48="🔋 - BoboVR charger + extra battery: $39.99" data-dimension25="$39.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJLG9SBR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="eMFieoeEuwBoQyxT3tmpMm" name="bobovr-m3-pro-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eMFieoeEuwBoQyxT3tmpMm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The classic BoboVR headstrap design is also known as a "halo-style strap" and includes a plush forehead pad and angled, flexible plastic strap that wraps another plush cushion around your head. It's fully adjustable and can even be angled to fit any head shape or size, making it the best choice for most people.</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: y</strong>ou hate the pressure VR headsets can put on your face. This headstrap design removes all the weight from your face and evenly distributes it around your forehead and the base of your skull, instead.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you play a lot of active games or workout in VR. Since it doesn't pull the headset tightly onto your face, it can wobble a lot if you're flinging your head around constantly.

If you're looking for an option that has hot-swappable batteries, there's simply no better choice. Each battery pack is 5,000 or 10,000mAh in capacity, which will double or quadruple your Meta Quest 3 or 3S's playtime, respectively.</p><p>Those battery packs are all recharged via a simple USB-C port, so any old phone charger you have lying around will work. Each headstrap type comes with one battery, but you can always order extra to keep the fun going for longer. Check the blocks for each product above, as I linked the correct battery for each headstrap type.</p><p>Remember that while the batteries might be model-specific, all three of these straps work for either the Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S, so you can game in comfort even if you opted for the more economical Quest 3S model!</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

But to get the best experience, you'll definitely want to grab a controller because touchscreen controls are just awful. As luck would have it, my favorite phone controller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Android-foldable-mapping-lighting-Smartphone/dp/B0D4YTBSFZ/"><strong>is down to $69.99</strong></a> for Amazon's Big Prime Day Deals, a discount of almost 50%.</p><p>What makes the ROG Tessen more unique than pretty much every other phone controller is how portable it is. This is because unlike the rest, the ROG Tessen can actually collapse and fold in half, making it great for throwing in your bag. But that's not the only reason why you should snag the Tessen for yourself.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ASUS ROG Tessen: $129.99" data-dimension48="ASUS ROG Tessen: $129.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Android-foldable-mapping-lighting-Smartphone/dp/B0D4YTBSFZ/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="ztdm9aX4GKYDr8tvEhxxsY" name="asus-rog-tessen-render-square" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ztdm9aX4GKYDr8tvEhxxsY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>ASUS ROG Tessen: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Android-foldable-mapping-lighting-Smartphone/dp/B0D4YTBSFZ/" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ASUS ROG Tessen: $129.99" data-dimension48="ASUS ROG Tessen: $129.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$129.99</del> <strong>$69.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>ASUS makes some of the best gaming hardware, and that includes the ROG Tessen.

ASUS might've been able to push things a little further, but seeing as the Tessen connects to your phone using USB-C, it just wasn't possible.</p><p>With that USB-C port, it not only ensures ultra-low latency for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">mobile gaming</a>, but the ROG Tessen also allows for passthrough charging. The only "catch" is that you're limited to 18W charging speeds, which should be enough to keep your phone topped off, but temper expectations.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Since Qi2 is based on MagSafe, compatibility with Qi2 devices that aren't from Apple should not be an issue.</p><p>Alternatively, you can also check out similar Qi2 certified charging stations from UGREEN recommended above. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Wireless-Charging-Certified-Compatible/dp/B0DZX7X8YB/">UGREEN offers a very affordable 2-in-1 station</a> with two Qi2 wireless charging pads. This model is super compact and comes in fun colors.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Qi2-Foldable-Wireless-Charger-Grey/dp/B0CX18S4T4/">brand also has a 3-in-1 charging station</a> that comes with a 30W USB-C adapter as well as a 3.3ft USB-C charging cable in the box. It's more similar to Anker's offering and even folds just like the Anker 3-in-1 Cube, but the design is not cube-like.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Sure, a color TV show or movie was an obvious upgrade from black & white from a fundamental perspective, but the quality of early color content simply didn't match the contrast of black & white programming.</p><p>Things were made worse by a lack of standards and difficult-to-use equipment. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOldPeople/comments/v04vgr/comment/iaee72x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">One Reddit user</a> remembers having to "twiddle knobs to decide whether the people would be orange or green."</p><p>In a way, color e-readers can suffer from similar problems but for very different reasons. I've been using the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II as my main e-reader since the middle of August, and I've been extremely impressed with the unit. However, my older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-page-review" target="_blank">Onyx Boox Page</a> still excels in a few areas that I didn't expect.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimebigdealdays%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-my-7360981637827775870-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><em><strong>Amazon Prime Day is back - see the official list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="clarity-and-light-2">Clarity and light</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uSX22gLJPodvcSj8Fh5DeB" name="onyx-boox-go-color-7-gen-2-watermelon" alt="A colorful watermelon background on an Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II with some pink Cosmos in the foreground" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uSX22gLJPodvcSj8Fh5DeB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's be clear: The Boox Go Color 7 Gen II (I'll call it the Go Color from now on for simplicity) is a better all-around e-reader than the Onyx Boox Page. The design has been refined to feel more comfortable in the hand, and the OS features new capabilities enabled by the updated display.</p><p>But anyone coming from an older black-and-white e-reader will immediately notice the graininess of the new color display. Flat white backgrounds now have an almost "old film" quality, giving the picture a distinct character that isn't present on digital stock. The same feeling can't be said for reading, where this grain can be distracting for some.</p><p>Text on the black-and-white Boox Page looks smooth and clean. Even when viewed through a macro lens, the Page's letters appear to be printed ink. However, the color screen has a distinct digital pixel look to each character.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-letters" alt="Comparing the screen quality between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II with a few letters on screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5n3nCpRJ8XBpGkt3tPWE59" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-white-background" alt="Comparing the screen quality of a white background between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5n3nCpRJ8XBpGkt3tPWE59.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GjfUMuMPibK7oiWLr66U59" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-icons" alt="Comparing the screen quality between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GjfUMuMPibK7oiWLr66U59.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>For some people, this won't be a big deal.

All these color chambers effectively create small divots in the display that trap light rather than help disperse it, unlike black-and-white E Ink.

The quick toggles panel now includes four preset options for the frontlight, making it easy to adjust brightness and color with a single tap without having to adjust each individual slider.</p><p>The E Ink adjustment panel is now simplified into a button layout with an AI-powered "recommended" setting that does a remarkable job of further streamlining the process.

That's made up for by the addition of color and a substantially better refresh rate, making it more versatile.</p><p>I also love the design changes, from the new button layout to the rough paper-like feeling on the back. At 7 inches, it remains a Goldilocks size for an e-reader since it's about the size of the average novel and is more comfortable to hold long-term than having to fold back a spine. Overall, a fantastic choice for an e-reader upgrade, so long as you don't mind the less paper-like display.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2fbefb4e-c054-44de-9deb-eaccc59c4ce9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P3dSym2GfCmLD7t3pS4XzS.jpg' alt="An official product render of an Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II with a colorful sketch on the screen"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Onyx Boox Color Go 7 Gen II</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>E Ink is already gorgeous, but when you add color to it, things get really impressive.

I left it on the beach and went for a swim, and the sound carried forward deep into the waters to serenade me. Highs and mids stand out especially clearly, with an electric, lively bass that weaves in just right. Something about Marshall's tuning makes it perfect for background music, without taking away from the audio quality. You feel like you've stepped inside the music, in a way.</p><p>I connected the Kilburn III to my PS5 using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Bluetooth-aptX-Adaptive-Transmitter-Headphones/dp/B0D7CKV1J8/">dongle from UGREEN</a>, and the result brought me great joy. Gaming is a delight thanks to the 360° True Stereophonic sound.</p><p>You can manually adjust bass and treble with the brass knobs on the fly, and there's a dynamic equalizer in the Marshall app to further customize and tweak the sound.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RiWiXPfDkZW6Yphh9nR6R4" name="marshall-kilburn-iii-lifestyle-5.JPG" alt="Marshall Kilburn III Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RiWiXPfDkZW6Yphh9nR6R4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MLiqoKVpp8ryZtLtE8i3Kb" name="marshall-kilburn-iii-lifestyle-6.JPG" alt="Marshall Kilburn III Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLiqoKVpp8ryZtLtE8i3Kb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>With those battery gains, it's jaw-dropping how long this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">amazing Bluetooth speaker</a> lasts. I use it every day, even with my PS5 via a workaround, and it easily lasts more than a week on light to mid use. With heavy use on high volume levels, it still delivers around five days. Thank goodness the Marshall Kilburn III has fast charging because recharging it occupies three long hours.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-it-2">Should you buy it?</h2><p>At $379.99, this isn't the cheapest 50W Bluetooth speaker around. However, the tech specs, Auracast compatibility, battery life, and sound quality definitely justify the price. I can't see myself turning to any other speaker for my portable audio needs.</p><p>In fact, it's not just me — my entire friend group is madly in love with the Kilburn III. We don't go on road trips without it. It is an honorary member of the group at this point, and just as loved. Whether it's ferries, boats, cars, or trains, one of us is willing to lug this 2.8kg monstrosity around because it's just that good.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7d191f0e-f85e-4261-9c56-3b0b64533991">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yC8j96QYXMfQzsD5AN5AiN.jpg' alt="Marshall Kilburn III"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Marshall Kilburn III</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="100" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Oh Marshall, my Marshall!</strong></em></p><p>The Marshall Kilburn III brings worthwhile upgrades to one of the best Bluetooth speaker ranges.

Your phone is optimized to do as much as it can while using as little power as possible, but it's still a very energy-hungry piece of electronics. We drain our battery so quickly because we use our phone excessively. If we use it less, we will have to charge it less.</p><p>Having said to horrible part out loud, there are things that can make a difference. For some of us, every tiny difference matters, so here's what you can do <em>without</em> putting your phone away.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kPyRVpvHn369kWqB9awZp3" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-adaptive-brightness" alt="Enabling Adaptive Brightness on a Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kPyRVpvHn369kWqB9awZp3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Dim your screen:</strong> Most of us probably use some sort of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-even-dimmer-brightness-tile-spotted">adaptive brightness setting</a>, which can help, but I know at least a few of us have that display cranked up all the way all the time. That's a good way to tank your battery (and your eyes). The best approach would be to set it to a manual setting and adjust it to be as dim as possible, while still being readable. Second best? Use the adaptive brightness feature that came with your phone.</p><p><strong>Choose a short screen time-out:</strong> Your phone's display shuts off after a set period of inactivity. You can set this time yourself in your display settings. The shorter the better, but I'd advise at least 30 seconds or less. It's easy to unlock your screen when you need to see it.</p><p><strong>Disable Always-On Display (AOD): </strong>While convenient for checking the time and notifications, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-will-finally-bring-always-display-its-phones-year">Always-On Display</a> constantly uses a small amount of power.

Activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-why-use-airplane-mode-during-flights" target="_blank">Airplane mode</a> or turn off mobile data, then manually enable Wi-Fi. The cellular radio uses more energy than most people realize, and a poor connection consumes significantly more of it.</p><p><strong>Check your location settings:</strong> Your phone will scan for nearby Wi-Fi and Bluetooth access points to assist in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whats-difference-between-precise-and-approximate-location-android-12">getting a more precise location</a>, and that can use some of your precious battery juice. Note that <strong>these scans occur even if Wi-Fi is turned off</strong>, unless your location settings are configured correctly.

That's fine if it's an app you actually use, but what about all that garbage that came with your phone that you'll never open? Uninstall them if possible, disable them if not, and if you're forced to leave them running, remember this the next time you choose which brand of phone to buy.</p><p><strong>Uninstall any apps you installed and never use:</strong> The same reason above applies here. Apps that came with your phone can usually do a lot more than ones you installed yourself, but those can still drain your battery. If you don't want it, trash it.</p><p><strong>Use your phone's battery management features:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/youre-using-ai-all-the-time-and-might-not-even-know-it">Your phone utilizes AI</a> to "learn" which apps you use most frequently and which ones are most critical to its functionality. These apps are left to do mostly their own thing, but the rest of them are throttled down to use a lot less battery. It really does work. While you're in there, be sure to set your phone to enter battery-saving mode when the percentage drops below a certain point.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3299px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CHdefhY9i6jJTV9GQ2AGdX" name="UGREEN-Uno-2-in-1-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-15W-lifestyle-4.jpg" alt="UGREEN Uno 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger 15W" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHdefhY9i6jJTV9GQ2AGdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3299" height="1856" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate to say it, but these tips really won't make a huge difference. The best thing to do is find a phone that can do what you need it to do, as long as you need it to do so. Phones get better every year, and the battery life of a phone in 2025 is miles better than one from just a few years ago.</p><p>One last tip from me that many people overlook is the use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers">wireless chargers</a>. A wireless charger can charge your phone from zero to full, but it's best used another way: to maintain the charge. When my phone isn't in my hand or pocket, it's sitting on a wireless charger. Since making this adjustment, I can't remember a time when my phone died before I expected it—not counting the Pixel 4, because, well, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-phones-pick-new-features-start-june">if you had one, you know</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The 8GB of RAM straight out of the box also offers powerful multitasking performance for most. Beyond that, the Edge also boasts an ultrawide and macro lens, a telephoto, and a regular rear camera, as well as a powerful selfie camera.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3fpsuHtSSt2LJWFWcmVarC" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-lock-screen-01" alt="The lock screen of the Motorola Edge 2025 showing notification icons at the bottom" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fpsuHtSSt2LJWFWcmVarC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All in all, it's not a perfect device, but the price drop definitely helps with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-review">Motorola Edge</a>'s value proposition, which is normally a little unbalanced. Add in a lack of promised updates and mid-level performance, and it definitely seems worth taking advantage of the discount instead of paying full price.</p><p>We've named the Edge the best Motorola phone for a handful of reasons, primarily because of its battery life, charging speeds, camera suite, and the vibrant 6.7-inch pOLED display. Like other Moto models, the Edge also includes a really nice anti-slip vegan leather backing, which feels good to hold and offers a little extra grip.</p><p>The Edge's performance is backed by a MediaTek Dimensity 7400 processor and 8GB of RAM, while the display also offers a 120Hz refresh rate. Although it comes with Android 15 pre-loaded, arguably one of the biggest downsides of this phone is that it only comes with two years of OS updates, which can be a dealbreaker for some.</p><p>For others, however, a $100 discount might be the right time to pick it up, as we would normally consider it a bit on the expensive side for the specs it has to offer.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-2025-quick-links-7">Prime Big Deal Days 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><u><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>USA</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>UK</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Canada</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>India</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong> </strong><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Target</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days has slashed the price of Lenovo's excellent Chromebook Duet 11 lower than ever before, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJH9WBLW"><strong>coming in at $209</strong></a>.</p><p>For that, you'll get the best Chromebook tablet on the market, along with an included folio keyboard, which makes this deal even more insane. The only thing that you'll need to grab is a compatible stylus, and there are some great deals on a few of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Penoval-USI2-0-Chromebook-Pressure-chromebook/dp/B0CMX315NG/">favorite USI pens</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11: $319.99" data-dimension48="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11: $319.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJH9WBLW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FjxYmhcv7wJ2iNHdzjyjmh" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-square-render.png" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FjxYmhcv7wJ2iNHdzjyjmh.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="584" height="584" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJH9WBLW" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11: $319.99" data-dimension48="Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11: $319.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$319.99</del> <strong>$209.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>If you want the best Chromebook tablet out there, it doesn't get any better than the Chromebook Duet 11. And for Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days, it can be yours for cheaper than ever. </p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/lenovo-duet-11-chromebook-11-2k-lcd-touchscreen-2-in-1-tablet-mediatek-kompanio-838-4gb-ram-128gb-emmc-with-keyboard-luna-gray/JJGSQV7JF5/sku/6597397">Best Buy (4GB/128GB) - $249</a> | <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/lenovo/lenovo-edu-chromebooks/lenovo-chromebook-duet-gen-9-11-inch-mediatek/83hh0000us">Lenovo (4GB/128GB) - $249</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>If you want a lightweight and portable Chromebook that doubles as an excellent tablet when paired with a USI pen.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a Chromebook that can handle more intense workflows with lots of different tabs, windows, and apps open at once.</p><p>As the name implies, the Chromebook Duet 11 sports an IPS display that's just about 11-inches, and looks much better than you might expect. While a lot of the rage is about devices having OLED screens, you probably won't even notice that the Duet 11 is using a 2K LCD panel.</p><p>Powering the Duet 11 is the MediaTek Kompanio 838, which also makes this a powerful device that easily makes it last through the day. The Kompanio 838 is paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, providing <em>enough</em> power for most tasks.</p><p>Considering that there aren't very many ChromeOS-powered tablets out there, your options are already limited. However, Lenovo continues to prove that it's dedicated to providing an excellent experience, regardless of what the rest of the market looks like. That trend continues with the Chromebook Duet 11, and frankly, this is probably the best Chromebook deal for most people.</p><p>While Amazon has the cheapest deal on the Duet 11, both Best Buy and Lenovo have also discounted the Chromebook. The only difference being that those retailers are offering the 4GB/128GB model for $250, while this Prime Big Day Deals discount is for the 4GB/64GB version.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

So many of them look nearly identical and all claim to be the best, but there's only one <em>real</em> best in town: Xreal One, and they're at their lowest price of all time with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC/?th=1"><strong>this $130 off Prime Day deal</strong></a>! That makes them even cheaper than before tariffs jacked up the prices.</p><p>Xreal One has sat at the top of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> list since they debuted earlier this year, and it's for one big reason: they just work. That sounds really stupid for any tech product, but if you've ever used a pair of smart display glasses before, you'll know how frustrating many of them can be.</p><p>When you plug a pair of Xreal One glasses into a Steam Deck, smartphone, tablet, computer, PS5, or something else, you're immediately greeted with a giant virtual screen that stays in place like a proper monitor. That means you can comfortably move your head around and the monitor stays in place, just as if you mounted a physical monitor on an imaginary desk in front of you. No other pair does this, and it's why you should pick them over all the others!</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f0b21dad-251b-4ffd-9194-cb882256559c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$130 off now" data-dimension48="$130 off now" data-dimension25="$449" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC/?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="KFX2dSFxBQENgP39wxcKfJ" name="xreal-one-glasses-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KFX2dSFxBQENgP39wxcKfJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>There's no turning back once you try Xreal One. These smart display glasses put a giant virtual monitor in front of you with full spatial tracking so you can move around without getting motion sickness. Plus, with tons of comfort options and excellent hardware design, you'll be wondering why you didn't pick up a pair sooner (but will be glad because they're <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC/?th=1" data-dimension112="f0b21dad-251b-4ffd-9194-cb882256559c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$130 off now" data-dimension48="$130 off now" data-dimension25="$449"><strong>$130 off now</strong></a>)!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC/?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f0b21dad-251b-4ffd-9194-cb882256559c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$130 off now" data-dimension48="$130 off now" data-dimension25="$449">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you hate looking down at your laptop or portable gaming console and getting neck pain, you take long trips and need a "home away from home" desk, or you just need a way to focus on your work without distractions.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a pair of smart glasses with a camera or AI functions. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Ray-Ban-Glasses-Wayfarer-Frames/dp/B0CGXX2HG5/">Stick with Ray-Ban Meta</a> for that, instead.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><strong>Prime Day is BACK October 7th and 8th - see the full list of deals</strong></a></li></ul><p>Personally, I love using Xreal One while traveling for work or pleasure. When you're on a plane trying to get work done, it's nothing short of harrowing attempting to work on your laptop on those tiny seatback trays. Not only are they stupidly cramped and will surely give you neck pain from having to look down, but you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/HardFactorPat/status/1232784648222187523">get your laptop crushed</a> by a reclining seat!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JWjcCPRQU8f3m6WjHg76GX" name="steam-deck-xreal-one-pro" alt="A Steam Deck and Xreal One Pro glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JWjcCPRQU8f3m6WjHg76GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I use Xreal One with my laptop on a plane, I keep the laptop almost completely closed, leaving just enough room for my hands to type and use the touch pad. This not only keeps the laptop from damage, but using the glasses saves my neck since I can look <em>forward</em> instead of down. It also doubles as a privacy filter since no one around you can see what's on your smart glasses.</p><p>The same advantages hold true for when I'm gaming on my Steam Deck on a plane. No one can laugh at me while I constantly die in Elden Ring, and I can have a far more comfortable posture since I'm not holding my arms at a 90-degree vertical angle the entire flight. Plus, the eye-friendly DC-dimmed micro-OLED displays on Xreal One glasses give me the best picture possible, all without a headache. It's epic winning!</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The bright, metallic hue debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> and Pro Max, instantly standing out from Apple’s typically conservative “Pro” palette.</p><p>Unlike the subtle blues and grays of the past, Cosmic Orange feels loud but refined, a perfect middle ground between playful and premium. Apple switched to anodized aluminum for the new iPhone frames this year, which made richer and more vivid colors like this possible. And if early reactions are any indication, it’s a hit. Units in this new color reportedly sold out within hours.</p><p>The trend doesn’t stop with Apple fans. Dbrand has joined in, releasing its own Cosmic Orange skins that match Apple’s color. These skins are available for many devices, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> and Galaxy S25 Ultra, as well as laptops, tablets, handheld consoles, and controllers.</p><h2 id="classic-dbrand-humor-serious-quality-2">Classic Dbrand humor, serious quality</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.32%;"><img id="QAG2v9WQk34xGBAsAr4o3F" name="Pixel-10-dbrand-skin" alt="Pixel 10 with Cosmic Orange skin from brand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QAG2v9WQk34xGBAsAr4o3F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1105" height="556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In true Dbrand fashion, the company didn’t hold back on the trolling either. “When Tim Cook hand-picked the new Cosmic Orange colorway, he had no idea we'd be ripping it off for a colormatched skin,” the brand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/shop/limited-edition/cosmic-orange" target="_blank">wrote on its site</a>. “To be fair, we didn’t think it’d be popular enough to warrant a ripoff. Now that it has, we’re all too happy to turn your Android into a Temu iPhone.”</p><p>That mix of humor and confidence matches Dbrand’s usual style. But beyond the jokes, the company puts real effort into its products. The new skins are carefully color-matched and work with over 100 devices. Each one is laser-cut for a precise fit and starts at about $25, so you can add some orange to your tech without paying Apple prices.</p><p>If you already have an orange iPhone, this is a chance to coordinate your setup. Now you can match your laptop, console, or tablet with your phone for a seamless look.</p><p>No one knows if this orange trend will stick around after the next Apple event, but one thing is certain: the color’s appeal goes beyond branding. It’s about confidence, the kind that makes your phone, laptop, or controller feel a bit more personal.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fa3f1c77-8bea-4570-9cd5-49af4a3cdfba">            <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/limited-edition/cosmic-orange" data-model-name="dbrand Cosmic Orange skin" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7zmwoTWJ5hEGrMhXddDVo.jpg' alt="Cosmic Orange skin for Pixel 10"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">dbrand Cosmic Orange skin</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Apple’s bold Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro is already a hit, and now Android users can get in on the action too.

You want a phone that has great AI features like Circle-to-Search. You want a phone with a damn good camera!</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you suffer from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a> or you don't need or want a phone that has Pro features.</p><p>When the Google Pixel 9 Pro was released last year, I knew that Google had finally made the right phone that would convince me to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-from-iphone-to-pixel-after-12-years">switch over from my iPhone</a>.</p><p>You see, up until then, I had been using an iPhone as my primary device for 12 years. And don’t get me wrong, I test, play, and learn about all Android devices, but there has never been a good reason to fully convince me that I could switch from an iPhone to an Android and not feel like I’m experiencing an entirely different OS permanently.</p><p>This is coming from someone who’s used the OG OnePlus device, a Pixel 4, and the OG Motorola Razr.</p><p>I think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro</a> was the phone that Google finally got right. Not only did it seamlessly allow you to switch from an iPhone to an Android, but it took out all the guesswork once you made the switch.</p><p>I’m not one to push people to buy things, but if there’s one phone you should buy during this Amazon Prime Big Deal Days sale event, it should be this phone.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVZVRZ"><strong>is currently 32% off, originally priced at $1,099; now it’s $749</strong></a>, which is a great deal, especially if you want to take advantage of some of the best features on this phone.

It’s a whole new operating system, and if you’ve been used to one OS for years, it’ll be hard to convince you to switch over.</p><p>I think Google made this process incredibly easy. It literally took me 30 minutes to switch over, and not only that, but have the same layout on my home screen as I did on my iPhone. Every single app was already downloaded and ready to go, and I no longer had issues dealing with different chargers — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">iPhone now uses USB-C</a>.</p><p>For those who have an iPhone 15, I think this was the phone that really allowed this switch-over to take place incredibly quickly.</p><p>But not only that, I’ve said this before and I will say it again…the Google Pixel is the “iPhone” of the Android ecosystem. It is the phone that Google puts out as a “standard” for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a> to build on and do better. It is the base phone that the Android OS uses to test out new Gemini features, which then go to other Android devices.</p><p>Now, whether or not other devices want to create their own version of features that Android OS or Gemini has is up to them. But in my opinion, I believe Google is giving OEMs a reason to develop better products, and they have done that with advancing the Pixel device.</p><p>I think one of the most critical aspects of the Pixel 9 series is that Google set a standard for AI features that a phone needs to have. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google got it right with Gemini</a>, and the company has had several years to enhance it.</p><p>Anyway, all I can say is that the Pixel 9 Pro is a gorgeous phone. It is easy to use, you won’t miss the iPhone, and you’re getting some of the best AI features ever.</p><h2 id="october-prime-day-quick-links-12">October Prime Day - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

We haven't seen this happen since July's Prime Day sale and that one totally sold out before the end of the first day, so be sure to grab this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-app-gemini-integration"><strong>$150 off deal</strong></a> now!</p><p>As you might expect from the name, the Google Pixel Tablet is the first Pixel-branded tablet to come with all the goodness of a Google Pixel phone in a larger form factor. It sports a Tensor processor with Gemini built-in, plus updates for years to come. In fact, it just got Android 16 plus the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-app-gemini-integration">new Gemini-powered Google Home app</a> update, making it an ideal choice for smart home control this year.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><strong>Prime Day is BACK October 7th and 8th - see the full list of deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="fdbcd0bb-b0b8-43cc-bd76-56de90722445" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="- Google Pixel Tablet 256GB: $499" data-dimension48="- Google Pixel Tablet 256GB: $499" data-dimension25="$249" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.04%;"><img id="kwometcyxXNwB94xFcWPib" name="Google-Pixel-Tablet-render-official-rose-display.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwometcyxXNwB94xFcWPib.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1455" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em><strong>Also see</strong></em><strong> - Google Pixel Tablet 256GB: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZMDNSBQ" data-dimension112="fdbcd0bb-b0b8-43cc-bd76-56de90722445" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="- Google Pixel Tablet 256GB: $499" data-dimension48="- Google Pixel Tablet 256GB: $499" data-dimension25="$249"><del>$499</del><strong> $309 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><strong>Price check 💵: </strong><a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_tablet"><strong>$279 at Google + </strong><em><strong>10% store credit for Google One members</strong></em></a></p><p>"For the most part, Google didn't try to reinvent the wheel with the Pixel Tablet. As an Android tablet, it's pretty much the perfect tablet for almost everything. But it really flexes its muscles when attached to the included Charging Speaker Dock, transforming it into a supercharged smart home display." — Andrew Myrick for Android Central</p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review"><strong>Android Central review</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2</a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're a casual tablet user who loves seeing their photos displayed in an elegant way, want a great smart home control center, and enjoys using the power of Gemini all without having to look for their phone. Pair it with the dock to turn it into an excellent speaker system, too!</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're a power user who spends lots of time on your tablet or absolutely needs top-tier performance. The Pixel Tablet isn't slow by any means, but it doesn't have ultra-high-end specs.</p><p><strong>Alternative deals 🪙</strong></p><p><strong>OnePlus Pad 3 - </strong><em><strong>the best high-end tablet</strong></em><strong>: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-3-4K-LCD-144-Hz-Snapdragon-8%E2%80%91Speaker-Aluminum/dp/B0FC2HCN1Q/"><del>$699</del><strong> $594 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><strong>TCL NXTPAPER 11 Gen 2 - </strong><em><strong>the most eye-friendly tablet screen</strong></em><strong>: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-NXTPAPER-11-Gen-Notebook/dp/B0FG7QV6SF/"><del>$289</del><strong> $229 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fdbcd0bb-b0b8-43cc-bd76-56de90722445" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="- Google Pixel Tablet 256GB: $499" data-dimension48="- Google Pixel Tablet 256GB: $499" data-dimension25="$249">View Deal</a></p></div><p>If you haven't used a Pixel Tablet before, here's what to expect. The $249 deal is for the tablet itself, which works like most tablets you've probably used. It's got a gorgeous 11-inch screen that's more eye-friendly than any Samsung OLED tablet on the market, plus battery life that'll last you days at a time.</p><p>The Pixel Tablet turns into a brilliant smart home controller and a Nest Hub-like display when you dock it, showing off all your recent photos from Google Photos in an elegant way. It's the best digital picture frame you'll find anywhere, but there's a slight catch to this functionality these days: Google no longer sells its expensive Pixel Tablet Speaker Dock.</p><p>Thankfully, you can still get hub mode working just fine with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Multi-Angle-Portable-Tablet-reader/dp/B01IJ5A0PC/?th=1">$8 tablet stand</a> and one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Charger-Anker-AirPods-Included/dp/B0C8HHV9DK/">these $11 chargers</a>. That's a lot cheaper than the $129 speaker dock, even if it's not as elegant of a solution. You can see how that looks in the image below.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="p6GUUYG9uRNTCMGC9Uq4DT" name="google-pixel-tablet-docked-with-charger-hub-mode" alt="A Google Pixel Tablet on a tablet stand running in Hub Mode while charging.

This can be used even while the tablet is locked, allowing anyone in your home to quickly and easily control anything you have connected to the Google home service.</p><p>It's the only tablet with this kind of functionality and the main reason it's a fantastic replacement for the Nest Hub line of smart displays. Plus, since it's a full-fledged tablet, you can undock it and carry it anywhere you want, in the home or out!</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Additionally, it still comes with the beautiful AMOLED 3.4-inch cover screen and 6.7-inch main screen, which boast 120Hz and 60Hz refresh rates, respectively.</p><p>The Z Flip 7 FE also gets 8GB of RAM for decent multitasking abilities, as well as a 4,000mAh battery and an IP48 water and dust resistance rating. While users do complain about the 25W wired charging being a bit too slow for the price point, this doesn't seem to be a dealbreaker for most.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-2025-quick-links-12">Prime Big Deal Days 2025 - quick links </h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><u><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>USA</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>UK</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Canada</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>India</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong> </strong><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Target</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> |</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong> </strong><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Instead of tapping letters, users literally rotate a dial to pick a character, let it go, and watch it snap back into place like a rotary phone.</p><p>Each of the nine dials represents a set of characters or commands, with sensors tracking rotation instead of the old pulse signals those phones once used. Even the “Return” key gets its own mini dial, because of course it does.</p><p>The new concept comes from Google Japan’s Gboard team, the same group responsible for a long-running streak of absurd but fascinating concept keyboards. Previous inventions have included a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/new-gboard-keyboard-in-japan">one-meter-long single-row keyboard</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeJY5d14qKs" target="_blank">bendable keyboard</a> that wraps around objects.</p><h2 id="completely-open-source-2">Completely open-source</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1185px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.76%;"><img id="aZFieaEzvH9ttfkW57deQk" name="Gboard-dial-version-schematics" alt="Gboard dial version being designed on a PC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZFieaEzvH9ttfkW57deQk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1185" height="637" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Japan / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Gboard Dial Version continues that experimental spirit but leans harder into open-source maker culture. Google isn’t selling it; instead, it released every bit of data — circuit board designs, CAD files, firmware, and assembly instructions — under the Apache 2.0 license on GitHub. That means anyone brave enough (and patient enough) can build their own rotary keyboard at home. For those less mechanically inclined, Google also provides plans for a simpler, single-dial version.</p><p>To picture how it works, think about dialing every letter you type. You put your finger in the right slot, turn to the character you want, and let go to select it. It’s definitely slow, but that’s intentional. The design encourages careful, hands-on input and helps prevent accidental key presses.</p><p>The design might even help reduce repetitive strain since it removes the constant finger-tapping motion of a traditional keyboard. It also features a charming mechanical feel, complete with the soft whirring sound of dials spinning back, offering a strangely satisfying, low-noise experience.</p><h2 id="more-fun-than-functional-2">More fun than functional</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1131px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="SCREumivmh4AMKb2KUWY34" name="Gboard-dial-version" alt="Gboard dial version with nine sets of dial" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SCREumivmh4AMKb2KUWY34.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1131" height="636" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Japan / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Japan clearly knows this thing isn’t practical for everyday work, but that’s not the goal. The Dial Version is equal parts joke, engineering challenge, and commentary on how we interact with digital input.</p><p>There’s even a nod to modern life — a small accessory stand doubles as a video call control: place your mouse on it to toggle your webcam or mic, just like “hanging up” an old telephone.</p><p>The company even experimented with a few design variants, from plain finishes to textured fabric covers that make it blend into home setups.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgdWyD0cBx4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div> ]]></dc:content>

It seems the company is rolling out support for users in Arkansas. The publication states users can check to see if they have it by heading into Wallet > Add to Wallet > Driver's License/State ID.</p><p>For users in Arkansas, the process of adding your State ID to Google Wallet is just like all the others.</p><p>After selecting which state you're in, you'll be prompted to first snap a photo of the front and back of your ID. Then, you will have to record a quick selfie video of your face for verification purposes. You can send off everything required via the app, and you should soon receive confirmation that everything checks out, so long as all the steps were completed appropriately. This verification process shouldn't take more than a few minutes, and the alert will appear as any other on your device.</p><p>Accessing your digital State ID is a process similar to accessing your saved cards in Wallet.</p><p>Something that Google has warned in the past, same as the publication reiterates today, having your ID digital does not replace your physical version. This regards TSA and law enforcement more strictly, as they may still want to see your <em>actual </em>ID. Users should begin noticing Arkansas appear as an option in the Wallet app on their Android phones today.</p><h2 id="digitizing-cards-for-seamless-days-2">Digitizing cards for seamless days</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MVmCk9Ug8dRT4g9HQBSgYX" name="Google-Wallet-student-id-hero.jpg" alt="College IDs sitting next to an Android phone with the Google Wallet app logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MVmCk9Ug8dRT4g9HQBSgYX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's been working with U.S. States to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-digital-id-support-in-yet-another-us-state">incorporate digital IDs</a> into the lives of its users, and this work continued even through the end of 2024. Late last year, New Mexico joined an ever-growing list of states that support digital IDs in Google Wallet. It joined the likes of California, Arizona, Georgia, Colorado, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, and North Dakota.</p><p>The interesting thing about Google Wallet's current list of supported State IDs is that we were told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay/google-wallet-brings-digital-id-support-to-uk-and-other-us-states">about Montana back in April</a>, the same as Arkansas. Those two states were listed alongside Puerto Rico and West Virginia; however, we're only seeing Arkansas today (Oct 6). Montana has since joined. So, it looks like Google is still working through any issues that may have arisen before users can see those promised states and territories in the app.</p><p>That announcement in April also highlighted digital ID support in the U.K., too. It's a more secure/safe way for residents there to confirm their identity. While passports were a part of this expansion for U.K. residents, Google said it's partnering with Rail Delivery Group to bring digital ID support to "select" Railcards in the U.K.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That means if your phone’s set to English, lyrics from a Spanish or Korean track will be translated into English by default.</p><h2 id="limited-control-for-now-2">Limited control for now</h2><p>There’s no manual language picker yet, so if you want a different translation language, you’d need to change your device or app language entirely. It’s a small limitation, but one that makes sense for early testing.</p><p>For now, only select Premium users seem to have access to the feature, and Google hasn’t confirmed when (or if) it will reach everyone. This test appears to be part of a broader update focused on enhancing the lyrics experience, following YouTube Music’s previous rollout of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-live-lyrics-rolling-out-widely">real-time synced lyrics</a> and new visual layouts.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:387px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.81%;"><img id="7VXicDX3TaHD3tkZv4kbT8" name="youtube-music-lyrics-translator" alt="real-time lyrics translator in YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7VXicDX3TaHD3tkZv4kbT8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="387" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Diego on Telegram / Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube Music’s translation system seems to use Google’s own machine translation tools, so quality may vary depending on the song and language. Like any automated translator, it might miss subtle nuances, idioms, or poetic wordplay, but it still offers a massive step forward for people exploring music beyond their native tongue.</p><p>This experiment also fits neatly into Google’s growing focus on AI-driven translation across its platforms. YouTube itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtubes-new-trick-automatically-re-dubs-any-video-into-your-native-tongue">recently expanded its auto-dubbing</a> and multi-language audio tools for creators, letting videos automatically generate dubbed versions in different languages.</p><p>Right now, there’s no timeline for a global rollout, and Google hasn’t shared details about supported languages or regions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

At this price point, it's hard to find many other competitors that even include ANC, let alone those from a brand-name like Samsung, whose products include a range of excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">phones</a>, tablets, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops">laptops</a>.</p><p>These make it particularly easy to pair with other Samsung devices, though they'll also work with just about any other Bluetooth-capable device. They also include touch buttons for playback and volume control, as well as simple recovery modes for finding the devices when they're lost. The included <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features also allow for live, real-time translation in some languages, while it's also easy to use the microphones for easy access to multiple voice assistant systems.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$97.99" data-dimension48="$97.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CF7GYNW2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1304px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:115.03%;"><img id="MBMe6LJJ6E5mArwjjVeoPU" name="samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-render-black.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBMe6LJJ6E5mArwjjVeoPU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1304" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Buds FE:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CF7GYNW2" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$97.99" data-dimension48="$97.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$97.99</del> <strong>$54.99 for Amazon Prime Day</strong></a></p><p>Samsung's FE Galaxy Buds are already amongst the company's more affordable earbud picks, but Amazon has recently brought the price down by 41% for Prime Day.

The so-called "Fan Edition" buds also come with built-in voice assistant access, real-time language translation features, and easy-to-use touch controls using the center platform on the earbuds. They also have SmartThings Find mode and Lost Mode for seeing their location on a map and sending a message to those who might find them, making them fairly easy to keep track of.</p><p>These earbuds are designed with a wing tip to help them stay in a user's ears more easily, and they also feature three silicone ear tip sizes in the package. While some users prefer a long, stalk earbud design or those that don't utilize an extra silicone ear tip, they look like a pretty decent pick for those who don't, and especially at this low price tag.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-2025-quick-links-17">Prime Big Deal Days 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><u><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><u><strong>USA</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><u><strong>UK</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><u><strong>Canada</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><u><strong>India</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><u><strong>Target</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While the OnePlus 13 is undoubtedly better, it isn't twice as good; the difference between the two is mostly down to the auxiliary cameras. Basically, the OnePlus 13R is the much better value, and if you need a new phone and don't care about the wide-angle and tele lenses, it is the device to get.</p><p>That's doubly so now; the OnePlus 13R usually costs $599, but it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/">now down to $499 on Amazon</a>, making it an even better value.

It has a similar design as the OnePlus 13, and the 120Hz OLED panel is among the best in this category. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 may not be the latest, but you'll hardly notice the difference while gaming — I didn't when I used the phone.</p><p>You also get a terrific 50MP camera at the back, and that's joined by a 50MP 2x lens. While it isn't as good as the OnePlus 13, it still does a decent job in most situations. In fact, the main camera is almost as good in all but low-light scenarios.</p><p>Then there's the battery; the 6,000mAh battery doesn't have silicon tech, but it is still the biggest battery in this segment, and it easily lasts a day and a half. In my use, I averaged two days between charges, and with 80W charging, it takes under an hour to fill up the massive battery.</p><p>All of this is my way of saying that if you want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/">new phone in the vicinity of $500</a>, there isn't anything better than the OnePlus 13R.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874XWW23" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon has slashed 41% off the 2TB Samsung T7 for October Prime Day</strong></a>, marking a great deal on an impressive amount of storage space.</p><p>This portable solid-state drive offers file transfer speeds of up to 1,050MB/s using the included USB 3.2 Gen 2 port. As such, the T7 not only includes tons of file space with the upgraded version offering 4TB of storage, but it's also fast enough for use cases like gaming, media editing, live recording and more. In particular, the T7 is well-liked for how incredibly small it is, easily letting users fit it into a pocket, backpack, purse, or other small bag. It measures just 72 grams and is just 8mm thick, making it a no-brainer as one of our favorite portable external storage devices.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>Prime Day is LIVE - see our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$187.99" data-dimension48="$187.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874XWW23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="guGxJXXZYZXnbMpqTwsnMh" name="samsung t7 portable ssd square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/guGxJXXZYZXnbMpqTwsnMh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung T7 Portable SSD (2TB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874XWW23" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$187.99" data-dimension48="$187.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$187.99</del> <strong>$109.99 for Amazon Prime Day</strong></a></p><p>With Amazon Prime Day officially in action, the retailer has launched a huge, 41% discount on this 2TB Samsung T7 solid-state drive.

If you need more than 2TB, the model is also offered in a 4TB configuration, or you can save a little extra money by downgrading to the 1TB option.</p><p>While it comes with read speeds of up to 1,050MB/s, it also offers write speeds of around 1,000MB/s, both of which are plenty fast for most users. Samsung also says this model is almost twice as fast as the previous-generation T5 model. It's suitable for use with PCs, phones, tablets and more, and it makes for a great storage companion when filming high-resolution video on a mobile device.</p><p>The T7 also comes in Titan Gray, Red, and Blue, but the biggest appeal to the unit is its tiny, portable design. It's just 72 grams, 8mm thick, 57mm wide, and 85mm long, making it a certified good pick as far as small SSDs go.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-quick-links-7">Prime Big Deal Days - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><u><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><u><strong>USA</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><u><strong>UK</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><u><strong>Canada</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><u><strong>India</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><u><strong>Newegg</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><u><strong>HP</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><u><strong>Target</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Yes, I get that it's still a lot of cash, but we don't usually see a 20% discount on Samsung's latest phones, and that's what makes this deal that much more enticing.

I'm using the blue model, and it looks exquisite. Of course, the thinner design combined with a lighter chassis makes it significantly easier to hold and use. At just 4.2mm when unfolded, it is thinner than just about every other foldable, and even when you fold it, the 8.9mm thickness is in line with most regular phones.</p><p>Both the inner and outer AMOLED panels have magnificent colors and contrast levels, and the foldable gets a new 200MP camera that's astonishingly good. The 4,400mAh battery manages to last all day, and I didn't see any issues in this area.</p><p>Then there's the software; Samsung's One UI 8 is right up there as one of the best software skins on Android, and this is doubly true when talking about foldables. Samsung did all the right things with the software, and you get to maximize the real estate of the inner 8.0-inch panel.</p><p>Ultimately, savings on $400 is nothing to scoff at — particularly on a new device like the Galaxy Z Fold 7. If you're ready to make the switch to a foldable, you'll should get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartphone-Unlocked-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0F7JZYWLL">Galaxy Z Fold 7 while it's still available for $1,599</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Initially, I was impressed by the smartwatch's seemingly endless battery life that refused to drain weeks in. Now that the watch is a few years old, we've seen a decent price drop. In my eyes, this makes it an even more worthy buy in 2025.</p><p>Two years on, I still use the Amazfit Balance every other day. It covers all the basics and performs smoothly until today, and the battery has not degraded either. I get to track all my health and fitness metrics, there's onboard storage for music, and there are plenty of other useful features like the ability to respond to texts.</p><p>The Amazfit Balance launched in September 2023 at a neat $199.99 price tag. You can currently buy the Balance smartwatch for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M/"><strong>$149.99 at Amazon</strong></a> or other retailers. And with Amazon's October Prime Day on the horizon, you could probably score an even sweeter deal on this Amazfit wearable. Compared to the newer Amazfit Balance 2 that costs an insane $299.99, I still recommend the original Balance model if you're on a tight budget. This smartwatch was so well-rounded that I continue to recommend it as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/best-amazfit-smartwatches#section-best-starter-option">best starter option when looking at top Amazfit smartwatches</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8dbf869f-1aa5-417d-a27d-3675a72137af" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="It might be two years old, but this toddler is still going strong and definitely worth your attention.

The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, released in September 2025, are the same AI glasses everyone knows and loves, now with longer battery life, improved camera quality, and more styles to choose from.</p><p>But the newest kid on the block, Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses, does exactly what it says on the tin. Instead of being purely audio-only, like the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, the newer Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses feature a nifty display in the right lens that works much like a smartwatch. They're also more than twice the price of Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, so while they feel like the future on your face, there's a price to pay to get there.</p><p>So, do you need the most expensive pair of smart glasses Meta offers, or would it make more sense for you to save some money and opt for the tried-and-true AI glasses?

The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 is entirely reliant on voice interaction for nearly all of its functions, but it features a physical camera shutter button on the top of the right arm, as well as a touchpad on the right arm that can be used to adjust volume, play or pause music, and more.</p><p>Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses feature these same inputs in addition to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">a neural band</a> that's used to detect gestures made with your hands. The cloth band fits comfortably on the wrist you'll primarily use to interact with the glasses' menus and can understand your movements via electrical impulses in your wrist muscles.</p><p>This allows Meta to open up an entire operating system's worth of functionality for Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses, including the ability to perform tasks like zooming in with the glasses' camera without needing to touch your glasses or use your voice. You can even reply to messages by "writing" on a table with your hand, or perform fun actions like pinching and rotating your fingers to adjust volume or zoom in and out of the camera.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uNbz3i6S5ACdwfzna6hRvi" name="meta-connect-2025-show-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-app-ui" alt="A screen capture of Mark Zuckerberg showing off Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' app UI at Meta Connect 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNbz3i6S5ACdwfzna6hRvi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The UI on the Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses falls somewhere between a smartwatch and a smartphone, offering numerous ways to perform everyday tasks that are too cumbersome for a smaller smartwatch display. Since it's on your face, Meta says it allows you to be more present with people in the room, rather than looking down at your watch or phone to check notifications or messages.</p><p>The display in Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses enables visual use of Meta AI in a way that's not possible with the audio-only Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s. While both types of glasses can perform many similar functions — such as taking photos or videos, providing live translation, playing music through the speakers, or using AI to identify objects in front of you — the addition of a display enables far more interactive elements.</p><p>The display on the Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses features a convenient accessibility feature called Live Captions, which utilizes the camera and AI to identify the people you're talking to, then displays closed captions on the glasses' display. Since no one can see the display from the outside, these captions are entirely private to you and can be great for noisy environments or people who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p><p>Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses also have a visual viewfinder for the cameras, while Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 users will have to just click the button and hope the picture is lined up right. Ironically, though, Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 has a more capable camera that can record at up to 3K resolution or at 1080p/60FPS. That's an upgrade over the 1080p/30FPS camera in Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses.</p><h2 id="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-vs-ray-ban-meta-gen-2-which-should-you-buy-2">Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses vs. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2): Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-display-live-captions" alt="An official image of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses' display showing live captions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Gj8LUwDDu3Va7pikJSANk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Content creators will likely want to choose the smoother or higher-resolution video on the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s, as the first-person perspective and ultrawide angle are able to capture everything in front of you without an issue.

Users can take photos normally, but save them separately to the Essential Space when they need to remember something for later. During the save process, users can attach a written note or a voice note to the image.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="645c853e-06ed-4da4-8d90-c2bc3ec39af6">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LdeEWY6LkaLEKRNnhJp4dY.jpg' alt="An official product render of the black Nothing Phone 3"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 is the company's attempt at making an overall better phone, to try and capture that flagship sentiment.

If you only install one app from this guide, it should be Gemini. It's hands-down the best AI app for Android users, thanks to its deep integration with Android and Google services. For those that haven't installed Gemini or replaced Google Assistant yet, you should consider it. We've also got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">a complete guide to Gemini and all its features</a> if you need a deeper dive into everything it can do on your smartphone.</p><p>Otherwise, picking one app from each remaining category should have your bases covered. For productivity, I recommend choosing an AI app based on the platform you use already. If you're deep in the Microsoft or Google productivity ecosystems, go with 365 Copilot or Drive, respectively. Those into Notion should use the AI features built right into the app. In terms of social media and photography, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ray-ban-meta-ai-versus-gemini-on-wear-os-pros-and-cons">Meta AI</a> and Google Photos are easy recommendations.</p><p>Either way, you can't go wrong with any of the AI apps on this list, and people really intrigued by the technology should try them all to find the one that works best for their needs.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Part of you wants to dive in, but the pragmatic voice reminds you that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">Black Friday and Cyber Monday</a> are just around the corner, promising the deepest discounts of the year. If you've decided to hold your wallet tight for the biggest shopping weekend, you might assume you should simply ignore the current sale.</p><p>This, however, is a classic shopping mistake. Even if you have zero intention of hitting the "Buy Now" button today, actively browsing Amazon's latest discount event is one of the most effective ways to arm yourself with crucial pricing intelligence for the <em>real</em> holiday shopping spree. Think of the current sale not as a primary purchasing event, but as <em>essential market research</em>—a scouting mission that will save you time and money when the November frenzy hits.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-11" alt="A white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL on a latticework black chair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The primary benefit of browsing now is establishing a <strong>baseline price.</strong> Too often, shoppers dive into Black Friday with only a vague idea of what an item costs.</p><p>Retailers are masters of the psychological pricing game, and a big, bold "40% OFF!" sign can easily mask a modest actual discount, especially if the product's price was recently inflated to make the sale look better. You create a tangible point of reference by tracking an item's price during a major pre-holiday sale.</p><p>For example, if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">noise-cancelling headphones</a> you covet are on sale now for $199, you know that their "normal" price is likely around $250. When Black Friday arrives, if you see them listed at $185, you immediately know it’s a genuinely better deal. If the price is $205, you can confidently hold off, knowing that the "Black Friday Special" is actually a worse offer than the earlier sale.</p><p>This is data-driven shopping at its finest, turning you from a passive consumer into an informed deal analyst. Amazon makes its money from being data-driven. You can use the same idea to save yours.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NRTPFqbNzZDAGAwck8YTbm" name="Amazon-Echo-Show-5-03.jpg" alt="Amazon Echo Show 5 (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NRTPFqbNzZDAGAwck8YTbm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, Amazon’s mid-fall sales, like its Prime-centric events, often reveal <strong>category-specific pricing trends.</strong> Different product types—from Amazon's own devices to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a>, accessories, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">wearables</a> follow distinct discounting patterns. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/amazon-devices-and-services-event-2022-live-blog-everything-that-is-expected-to-be-launched">Amazon devices</a> (like Echos and Fire tablets) are almost guaranteed to see significant drops now, and those prices can often serve as a ceiling for their Black Friday price. By observing this, you can predict with reasonable accuracy which <em>categories</em> will see the deepest cuts next month, allowing you to prioritize your Black Friday shopping list</p><p>The current sale also provides an invaluable look at <strong>stock and seller behaviour.</strong> Are certain popular items already selling out? If a product is consistently unavailable or constantly fluctuating in price, it signals high demand. This is critical information for Black Friday, suggesting you'll need to move fast on that particular item or category, or risk it being gone entirely. Likewise, if you see an obscure third-party seller offering a surprisingly aggressive discount, it can be a harbinger of the competitive environment to come.</p><p>I'm old enough to remember the crazy, almost violent, consumer behavior over items like Beanie Babies or the Nintendo 3DS. We buy from home now, so things can sell out even faster.</p><p>Finally, browsing now is simply a fantastic way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls?ref_=ya_d_c_lists" target="_blank">organize your wish list</a><strong>. </strong>The impulse to shop during Black Friday can lead to poor decisions or a frantic, last-minute search. By clicking around now and adding potential purchases to your "Save for Later" list, you streamline your Black Friday experience. You can then quickly compare the November deals against your noted baseline prices without being distracted by the overwhelming chaos of the main shopping weekend.</p><p>In the world of holiday shopping, knowledge is power, and data is currency. Don't let the current Amazon sale pass by unexamined. Put in the legwork now, track those prices, and you’ll find that the true value of the early sale isn't in what you buy today, but in the serious savings you’ll unlock when Black Friday officially begins. Your bank account will thank you.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-quick-links-12">Prime Big Deal Days - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

In fact, the Pixel 10 series introduces over a dozen new AI features to the flagship lineup, and while some of them miss the mark, the phones are still essential for any AI enthusiast's toolkit. The Pixel 10 Pro is also one of the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> to come with Qi2 wireless charging support.</p><p>So the big question remains: should you buy the Pixel 10 Pro from your wireless carrier or wait and see what Prime Big Deal Days has in store for us? It's totally up to you, but I'm certainly glad I checked T-Mobile's website before I got too excited about Prime Day.  </p><h2 id="october-prime-day-quick-links-17">October Prime Day - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Specifically, the document the publication reported highlights the "LTE to 5G standalone transition" plans that T-Mobile has, which will reportedly occur over the next "two-plus years."</p><p>Regarding "business impact," the alleged T-Mobile plan claims its LTE contracts will not go beyond 2035, as the "LTE network will be maintained" until that year rolls around. It seems T-Mobile is expecting its LTE network to "degrade" as it puts its transition plan into action.</p><p>These issues T-Mobile anticipates include a bottleneck on its LTE network, as well as a hit to performance and service quality for phones, tablets, wearables, and more for LTE and 5G NSA (non-standalone) devices. This is also likely due to T-Mobile seemingly only looking to keep a sole 5MHz LTE channel available to the last remaining vestiges of LTE devices.</p><p>As T-Mobile moves into its 5G-only future, it states that by January 1, 2026, devices activated for its network should be 5GSA (standalone) capable, so there's no issue once its LTE spectrum is gone. Going by this report (and document), the publication assumes most of T-Mobile's transition to 5G-only will be done by 2028.</p><h2 id="a-change-in-service-2">A Change in Service</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="4ETTSfPhU6MfSiqtbJMkMb" name="tmobile5g.jpg" alt="T-Mobile coverage map" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ETTSfPhU6MfSiqtbJMkMb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="451" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the root of this report is that T-Mobile is looking to finally phase out LTE support, as the publication notes, this isn't likely to affect most consumers. Devices nowadays are already capable of that 5G future, so shifting LTE out shouldn't really cause a disturbance. We'll have to see where things go with T-Mobile, such as more confirmed information from the service.</p><p>In the name of "exciting" service updates, T-Mobile's T-Satellite network recently made an announcement regarding "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile/t-satellite-android-apps-to-the-stars-satellite-ready-access-on-t-mobile">Satellite-ready</a>" apps for your phone. The T-Satellite network enables users to remain in contact with the world even without a cell connection, as it uses satellites to do its work. Now, the company is extending that support to apps users frequently use, like WhatsApp, X (Formerly Twitter), AccuWeather, and more.</p><p>Users can still check in on social media and make posts on X without a standard cell signal. For WhatsApp, users can text, send pictures, and make regular calls and video calls all on its satellite network. Satellite-ready app access started rolling out to Android and iOS devices on T-Mobile's T-Satellite network on October 1.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Notably, live translation features that eliminate language barriers in real-time are on the rise.</p><p>We've seen features debut in smartphones, earbuds, and even smart glasses. Truthfully, the idea of live translation isn't new, but it's coming into its own in 2025 thanks to improvements in support and performance. Apple recently highlighted Live Translate as a perk of its new AirPods Pro 3, and a similar feature leveraging Google Translate already existed on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>.</p><p>So, is Google's or Apple's version of live translate the best? We tried them both, and although neither is perfect, these are the key ways they compare — and which one we prefer.</p><h2 id="all-the-differences-between-apple-and-google-s-live-translate-features-2">All the differences between Apple and Google's live translate features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EhrBCszXotrftiBTQ5yUVR" name="Apple-Google-Live-Translate-1" alt="The Live Translate feature on Apple and Google hardware." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EhrBCszXotrftiBTQ5yUVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Live Translate is marketed as a unique earbud feature in 2025, but the legwork is still being done on your smartphone. To use Apple's live translation with a supported pair of AirPods, you'll need an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or newer running iOS 26 or later. While it might seem like an arbitrary cutoff, an iPhone 15 Pro is needed because live translation uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/this-is-the-best-thing-about-the-the-ever-evolving-wave-of-ai-on-our-phones">Apple Intelligence</a>, which isn't available on the base iPhone 15 or older models.</p><p>This also means that Android users who own a pair of AirPods for wireless audio (yes, they do exist) won't be able to take advantage of Apple's live translation features at all. By comparison, Google's equivalent is much more forgiving. You only need an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> running Android 6 or later to use live translation on a pair of Google Pixel Buds.</p><p>This includes all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Google Pixel phones</a>, but also the vast number of Android phones by other brands that meet the version requirement. You can use a pair of Google Pixel Buds with a Samsung or OnePlus phone and still use Google's live translation feature, for instance. You'll just need to ensure your phone has the latest version of the Google and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-is-about-to-tap-into-gemini-for-more-reliable-translations" target="_blank">Google Translate apps</a> installed, as both are required for live translation.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gZULkSsJYweAjdoMSeh8xM" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-2" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gZULkSsJYweAjdoMSeh8xM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the Apple and Google implementations of live translate use off-device processing by default, so you'll need an internet connection. However, you can download languages for offline translation via the Settings app on iOS and the Google Translate app on Android.</p><p>Apple also offers an "on-device mode" that will always use offline, on-device processing for translations. However, it's worth noting that this mode only applies to the Apple Translate app, which is used for AirPods translation. If iPhone users want to translate with Siri or Safari, those translations will always be processed in the cloud.</p><p>The way you trigger live translation on Pixel Buds and AirPods is also slightly different. For Google Pixel Buds, the preferred method of using Live Translate seems to be using Google Translate on your phone and tapping <strong>Conversation mode</strong>. Alternatively, you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> to trigger live translation by saying a phrase like "<em>Hey Google, help me speak [language]</em>."</p><p>There's no way to use Conversation mode hands-free without using Google Assistant; otherwise, you'll need to pull out the Translate app on your Android phone. Apple's implementation differs slightly. You can use Siri for translation, but the preferred method is to hold down both AirPod stems to trigger live translation.</p><h2 id="do-you-need-the-latest-airpods-or-pixel-buds-to-use-them-2">Do you need the latest AirPods or Pixel Buds to use them?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zGt85NjuYy6KGMHxvrRnWR" name="Apple-Google-Live-Translate-3" alt="The Live Translate feature on Apple and Google hardware." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGt85NjuYy6KGMHxvrRnWR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both Apple and Google have tremendous support for live translation features, even on older devices. However, Google clearly offers an edge. It has been shipping real-time translation on earbuds since 2017, dating back to the very first pair of Google Pixel Buds. The feature has since been available on every pair released since, from the high-end Pixel Buds Pro 2 to the affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-buds-series-review">Pixel Buds A-series</a> and new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-buds-2a-announced">Pixel Buds 2a</a>.</p><p>Apple's feature is currently listed as a beta offering, so it won't be perfect. It was announced alongside the AirPods Pro 3, but it's also coming to AirPods Pro 2 and the ANC model of AirPods 4 via a software update.</p><p>So, chances are, if you have a new enough pair of Apple or Google earbuds, you'll be able to utilize live translation.</p><h2 id="are-the-airpods-pro-3-or-google-pixel-buds-pro-2-better-for-live-translation-2">Are the AirPods Pro 3 or Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 better for live translation?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tTJNQPBUj2j9cUNUfCv9zR" name="Apple-Google-Live-Translate-2" alt="The Live Translate feature on Apple and Google hardware." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tTJNQPBUj2j9cUNUfCv9zR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The aforementioned differences between calling up live translation on AirPods and Google Pixel Buds are the most impactful to the experience. It's nice to be able to walk up to someone who doesn't speak your language, hold both stems, and start hearing a translated version of their speech in your ears. There are no voice commands or smartphone taps required when using a supported AirPods and iPhone, which is ideal.</p><p>By comparison, it can be cumbersome to use clunky voice commands or pull out your phone to use Conversation mode with live translation on a pair of Google Pixel Buds. Certainly not a dealbreaker, but it's a minor inconvenience.</p><p>In terms of quality, there's still a ways to go before we're conversing at a natural pace with others between languages. The live translation features on both Apple or Google earbuds have a noticeable delay — currently necessary for processing and wireless transmission — that might impede the flow of a conversation.</p><p>Additionally, it isn't uncommon to have either feature completely miss a sentence or phrase. All it takes is someone speaking too fast, a noisy environment, or an unfamiliar dialect to throw Apple Translate or Google Translate off its game. However, it's certainly easier to use AirPods or Pixel Buds for live translation than flipping through a language phrasebook or guide.</p><p>Like almost everything leveraging AI these days: when it works, it's magical, but you can't depend on it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra users give up a bit of room for a bigger battery in favor of a siloed S Pen, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable</a> users often sacrifice camera quality for the dual displays and hinge.</p><p>In 2025, smartphone brands are emphasizing thinness and lightness as key features. It started with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/i-bought-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-but-no-one-else-did">which drew ire from Android fans</a>, and Apple took that concept to the next level with the iPhone Air, which seems to concede <em>something</em> in every area in the pursuit of a futuristic design. It's the epitome of form over function.</p><p>As a result, the iPhone Air is inherently controversial. I admittedly love thin and light phones, and using the iPhone Air for two weeks cemented that as it's much easier to handle. That said, I also agree with the iPhone Air's detractors that Apple made significant compromises to get there, and it's an incredibly niche device for that reason.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimebigdealdays%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-my-7360981637827775870-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><em><strong>Amazon Prime Day returns October 7th - see the official list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-air-pricing-availability-and-specs"><span>Apple iPhone Air: Pricing, availability, and specs</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2btLdzoK4uUKxd9jBWuTB4" name="iPhone-Air-16" alt="The back of an iPhone Air in Sky Blue on a wooden bench." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2btLdzoK4uUKxd9jBWuTB4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone Air launched alongside the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup on Sept. 19, 2025, and is now widely available in the U.S and globally as of September 26.

I don't see it that way. The iPhone Air is more of a return to form for Apple, reverting to a time when its product design prioritized a delicate balance between form and function — and leaned more toward form when necessary.</p><p>Even the idea of cramming the iPhone Air's logic board into the camera plateau isn't really new to Apple; the design strategy used to build the iPhone Air can be traced back to as early as 2015.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qf96a2e9iVtQFqEqLNwNn3" name="iPhone-Air-10" alt="The volume rocker and action button on an iPhone Air in Sky Blue." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qf96a2e9iVtQFqEqLNwNn3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone Air is extremely thin and impressive, but in a way that aligns with recent products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>. It measures 5.64mm thick across much of the body, with a sloping camera plateau that stashes away the internals and a single rear camera.</p><p>The plateau appears much larger in photos than it actually feels in person. In fact, I've come to use it as a place to rest my pointer finger while holding the Air, sort of like a grip or PopSocket. It helps for stability and usability, as I can hold the iPhone Air one-handed without it slipping due to the plateau.</p><p>It's covered with glossy glass, but the main rear glass slab of the iPhone Air has a matte, frosted finish. I'm not sure I like the contrasting materials on the back, but the glossy plateau matches the polished titanium side rails. Between all the glass and titanium, the iPhone Air feels premium, possibly the <em>most</em> premium out of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/deciding-between-iphone-17-models-as-an-android-user-heres-what-to-consider">iPhone 17 lineup</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hewf9msP7VaZhRpjyRR2B4" name="iPhone-Air-8" alt="A close-up of the camera plateau of an iPhone Air in Sky Blue on a blue chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hewf9msP7VaZhRpjyRR2B4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The colors are relatively uninspiring. The Sky Blue Air used for this review looks very similar to the Cloud White or Light Gold models. I was so unimpressed that I returned mine for Space Black, which I think is the best color.</p><p>The titanium frame, Ceramic Shield 2 glass, and IP68 protection should enhance the iPhone Air's durability. I didn't baby my Air at all, rocking it caseless and dropping it accidentally on occasion, and there was no notable wear. The material choices here should help it fare better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, which has anodized aluminum that can scratch off or scuff up over time.</p><p>An underrated feature of the iPhone Air is its weight, as the phone weighs just 165g. It's slightly heavier than the Galaxy S25 Edge, but it's still incredibly light for a phone in this size class.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6Q8zCFn6AsbaT74uR5g9D4" name="iPhone-Air-13" alt="The USB-C port of iPhone Air in Sky Blue in the hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6Q8zCFn6AsbaT74uR5g9D4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the bottom, you'll find a slightly off-center USB-C port that's actually 3D printed to make it as thin and durable as possible — a magnificent engineering achievement for Apple. You won't find any speakers, because unlike the rest of the iPhone 17 lineup, the iPhone Air <em>only</em> has an earpiece speaker.</p><p>This is understandably shocking, as we've taken stereo speakers on phones for granted in recent years. However, it's worth noting that the earpiece speaker is louder than expected, reaching a volume of around 70dB in my testing. Its volume is suitable for speaker calls, watching quick videos, or listening to a song. Quality is another matter entirely, because there's heavy distortion when the volume is set above 70%.</p><p>Even as a budding audiophile, I don't think the iPhone Air's mono speaker is a dealbreaker. It's fine in a pinch, and I can use earbuds, headphones, and proper speakers when I care about quality. If you're someone who uses their phone speaker, steer clear of the iPhone Air.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-air-display"><span>Apple iPhone Air: Display</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oN3nfs3HV8cD7B8zTU8kn3" name="iPhone-Air-4" alt="The display of an iPhone Air in Sky Blue on a blue chair." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oN3nfs3HV8cD7B8zTU8kn3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The 6.5-inch OLED display (120Hz) is gorgeous, but brightness throttling remains a pain point.</strong></li><li><strong>The Ceramic Shield 2 anti-reflective coating isn't as good as Samsung's, but improved scratch resistance is a win. </strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5-things-android-should-steal-from-apple-iphone-17-event"><strong>5 things Android should steal from Apple's iPhone 17 event</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/5-things-apple-stole-from-android-during-the-iphone-17-event"><strong>5 things Apple stole from Android during the iPhone 17 event</strong></a></p></div></div><p>The iPhone Air replaces the iPhone 16 Plus in the lineup, but only on paper.
