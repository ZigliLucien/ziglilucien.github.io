The publication states it observed problems with a Pixel 10 unit following the small 15MB patch. This device seemed to have the biggest issue, as the post highlighted a very sluggish Pixel launcher. The post states that the Pixel launcher "did not fully load."</p><p>The device's screen was stuck, only displaying its wallpaper for a considerable amount of time without producing a major necessity: its UI. Additionally, 9to5 notes that their status bar was also missing after the update.</p><p>Tests were conducted with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">Pixel 10 Pro</a>, which also displayed problems. The report adds that the Pro model struggled after rebooting. To be specific, the device's screen "remained black" for what seemed like a prolonged period of time. It's unclear just how widespread these issues are, and if they're directly tied to the latest Google Play systems update (which they could be, considering the timing).</p><p>The publication notes that once the rebooting sequences are completed, the Pixel devices don't appear to struggle. A common occurrence reportedly concerns the rebooting sequence and how sluggish it is.</p><h2 id="slow-start-to-the-new-year-2">Slow start to the new year</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U8SkPHytXzMKEFf7gU534g" name="google-pixel-10-pro-jade-pixel-10-pro-xl-porcelain-backs" alt="The backs of the porcelain Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro standing next to each other on a bench" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U8SkPHytXzMKEFf7gU534g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 has had a rough go of it recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-aod-display-flickering-issue-december-2025-update">as December brought issues</a> with the bitter cold.

The 45mm model easily lasts two days in ideal conditions and performed very well in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-battery-test">battery test</a>, handling GPS workouts or LTE streaming with ease.</p><p>Because of this, I tend to use Watch 4 settings that drain its battery <em>faster</em> for a better user experience. But for those of you who'd prefer the opposite, and want to maximize your Pixel Watch 4 battery life — particularly as its capacity fades with time — these are the simple tricks and downgrades to make the Watch 4 last longer per charge.</p><h2 id="turn-on-battery-saver-mode-2">Turn on Battery Saver mode</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mYA4Po7VW9FEStYqHMm3oB" name="Pixel-Watch-4-Battery-Saver-mode" alt="A photo of the Pixel Watch 4 on a wrist showing "Turn on Battery Saver mode?" prompt, with info on what settings will change with this mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mYA4Po7VW9FEStYqHMm3oB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll start with the obvious setting that you probably know about already.

That's why I'm glad Motorola decided to go stick with its own software and team up with Polar for the Moto Watch.</p><p>The Moto Watch isn't quite a reincarnation of the Moto 360, but it looks great in its own right. The smartwatch has an elegant design, has a steel crown along with an aluminum chassis. As with all Motorola wearables, it's available with a variety of bands, and I like the overall design — it looks like a regular watch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9MYoEFyCkRkaPnHFSUr8ye" name="Moto Watch" alt="Moto Watch hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9MYoEFyCkRkaPnHFSUr8ye.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 47mm case is on the bigger side, and it houses a 1.43-inch OLED panel with Corning's Gorilla Glass 3 coating to provide a layer of resistance against tumbles and scratches. The case is available in white and black, and you can easily switch out the bands if you want to use your own. There are two buttons on the side, and even though it is a pretty big smartwatch, it's light.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a9GvgfpTcvBAjqwxwBE96f" name="Moto Watch" alt="Moto Watch hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a9GvgfpTcvBAjqwxwBE96f.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="utSKfKTCJ3zVNupgp7zp4f" name="Moto Watch" alt="Moto Watch hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/utSKfKTCJ3zVNupgp7zp4f.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As it uses Motorola's custom software, the brand is touting 13 days of battery life between charges.

And yes, fast charging is intact, with the smartwatch delivering a day's worth of use with a 10-minute charge.

If you need a new NAS, you should just consider one of the brand's products; its new budget DH2300 2-bay server starts at just $177, and if you need plenty of power, the DXP4800 Plus, DXP6800 Pro, or the DXP8800 Plus are the obvious choices based on your needs.</p><p>At CES 2026, UGREEN showcased its brand-new AI-enabled NAS series, the NASync iDX6011 and iDX6011 Pro. Both models are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nas.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-ai-nas-feature-introduction?utm_source=Gabymedia&utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=idxpr">now on pre-order at UGREEN's website</a> and will be available in a general sale later in Q1, and they're targeted at enthusiasts.</p><p>As is always the case with UGREEN, the brand is rolling out decent incentives if you pre-order the iDX6011 or iDX6011 Pro. The high-end iDX6011 Pro with 64GB of RAM is slated to retail for a staggering $2,599, but you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nas.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-ai-nas-feature-introduction?utm_source=Gabymedia&utm_medium=pr&utm_campaign=idxpr">get it for $1,559 during the pre-order window</a>. Similarly, the base model iDX6011 with 32GB of RAM can be bought for $999, a $700 discount from its eventual $1,699 retail price, and there's a variant of the iDX6011 with 64GB of RAM that's available for $1,119 — it will retail at $1,999.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4824px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="BDUJkRXzniFLjccCvvCSeK" name="UGREEN iDX6011 Pro" alt="UGREEN iDX6011 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BDUJkRXzniFLjccCvvCSeK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4824" height="2714" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UGREEN)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's get started with what you're getting with these NAS servers. The iDX6011 Pro is the one that's interesting to me, as the 6-bay server has incredible hardware. It is powered by the Intel Core Ultra 7 255H, and the 28W TDP platform is just so much more powerful than what you usually see in this category. There are six HDD bays alongside two M.2 slots, and each HDD bay can hold a 30TB drive, with the M.2 slots accommodating 8TB drives — that's how you get total addressable storage of 196TB.</p><p>The iDX6011 Pro also gets 64GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and that's more than what I have in my RTX 5090 gaming machine. You get a 128GB SSD pre-installed that houses the software, two 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports, dual Thunderbolt 4 ports, PCIe Gen 4 x8 slot, a total of four USB-A ports, SD card slot, HDMI, and even OCuLink connectivity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4824px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="crFSsqLVWdWdipAGfNLpVK" name="UGREEN iDX6011" alt="UGREEN iDX6011 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/crFSsqLVWdWdipAGfNLpVK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4824" height="2714" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UGREEN)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oh, and you also get a 3.7-inch LCD panel that shows storage use, system stats, and network status.

Xreal is now the main hardware partner for Google’s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> ecosystem.</p><p>Google’s XR journey has had its ups and downs, starting with the promise and later retreat of Google Glass, followed by years of quiet work as others moved ahead. Things shifted late last year when Google launched Android XR, a new operating system for devices ranging from mixed-reality headsets to lightweight AR glasses.</p><p>The first products focused on bigger devices, like Samsung’s Galaxy XR headset, but Google has made it clear that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">glasses</a>, not large headsets, are the real goal.</p><h2 id="google-s-ar-focus-is-on-glasses-2">Google's AR focus is on glasses</h2><p>This is where Xreal fits in. The company is known for making AR glasses that are ready for everyday use, not just prototypes. With this expanded partnership, Xreal becomes Google’s main hardware partner for "optical see-through devices."</p><p>Google and Xreal will now co-develop hardware roadmaps, align software features with physical design, and ensure Android XR apps work as people expect when projected into real space.</p><p>The first tangible result of that collaboration is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-unveils-the-future-of-xr-new-features-for-galaxy-xr-and-upcoming-smartglasses-teased">Project Aura</a>, a new pair of Android XR glasses slated to arrive in 2026. These aren’t just prototypes. They’re built to give a wide field of view, about 70 degrees, while staying connected to an external computer. This keeps the glasses themselves light.</p><p>Android XR includes familiar Android development tools, supports OpenXR, and is closely integrated with Gemini AI. Google believes this is key to hands-free, context-aware computing.</p><p>It’s still early days for Android XR. The platform is new, developer tools are still improving, and useful apps will take time to arrive. Still, the direction is clear, with Google setting the stage for XR devices people will actually want to wear.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Oura is trying to solve two problems with this charging case: first, the on-the-go issue that many of its Members have reportedly informed it about. Second, not relying on the charger in their house so often. Oura states that its charging case can hold up to "five full charges," meaning users could, in theory, go "weeks" without needing the wall plug-in charger.</p><p>While you're busy charging your Oura Ring, users will need to charge their case, too. The post states that the case is provided with a USB-C cable for its charging needs.</p><p>In "under 90 minutes," the case is reported to reach its maximum charge. Additionally, your Oura Ring is estimated to reach its maximum in roughly 20-80 minutes, depending on what its percentage is at the start. Users can check their ring's charge via the Oura app.</p><p>The charging case was crafted with recycled aluminum, making it resistant to splashes. More importantly, since this is designed for a smart ring, Oura states the case is rather small, making it the perfect size to slip into your pocket.</p><p>The charging case is compatible with the Oura Ring 4 and the Ring 4 Ceramic. The company states that the case will start at $99, available at ouraring.com and "select" online retailers.</p><h2 id="grab-n-go-2">Grab 'N Go</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.64%;"><img id="HTj4ycJnhDaMsGJk6sfnRD" name="Oura-Ring-4-charging-case" alt="Oura launches it's first ever charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HTj4ycJnhDaMsGJk6sfnRD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="853" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you missed it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-unveils-stylish-ceramic-rings-and-its-first-ever-charging-case">the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic launched</a> this past fall, bringing those mood ring vibes you might feel nostalgic about. Sporting a glass aesthetic, the Ring 4 Ceramic still offers the same health features consumers have come to expect and know from Oura. The ring measures 7.9mm in width; however, it is slightly thicker (3.51mm) due to its zirconia ceramic material. Regardless, consumers can find the device in Tide, Petal, Cloud, and Midnight.</p><p>Concerning its features, Oura recently introduced its Health Panel for $99 in-app, bringing 50+ cardiometabolic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-ring-users-can-now-access-over-50-blood-biomarkers-for-usd99">blood markers tracking</a> capabilities.</p><p>Oura states that this provides a more comprehensive look into a person's body, as it integrates insights from your Ring with those cardiometabolic blood markers. Oura stated that it wanted to truly focus on delivering the "what" and "why" behind what users see. As an example, Oura states that if a user's A1C is creeping up on them, they're immediately able to see what might've affected that. Think about your sleeping habits, eating habits, and the like.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While Motorola's best efforts are focused on foldable Razr models like the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold-first-impressions">Razr Fold</a>, it still has plenty to offer with regular phones. In fact, Motorola is ready to challenge the status quo, and the brand is rolling out the Signature, a new series that aims to hold up against the likes of the OnePlus 15.</p><p>I was able to use the Signature at CES 2026, and while I haven't tested Motorola phones in a few years, I don't remember the manufacturer's devices being this good. That OnePlus comparison is apt, as the Signature immediately feels like OnePlus devices of yesteryear. The sleek design with a thickness of just 6.9mm along with the rectangular camera island reminds me of the OnePlus 10 Pro, and the in-hand feel is similar as well. While it has flat sides, the subtle bevels make the phone highly comfortable to hold and use, and it just feels better than the chunkier Vivo X300 and Find X9.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xVxYWP43au9rC7w2wcyonR" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xVxYWP43au9rC7w2wcyonR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, that's also down to the fact that the Signature has a smaller 5,200mAh battery. Thankfully, Motorola is using silicon-carbon tech, so you get better density — leading to a thinner phone — and better durability in challenging weather conditions. I wasn't able to test that as I used the Signature in a comfortable (albeit harshly lit) briefing area in Las Vegas, but seeing as how it also has IP68 and IP69 ingress protection, it should hold up to any adverse weather just as well as other Android phones.</p><p>Motorola had the green and black models of the Signature available, and I like the green option — it just has a better presence, and the brushed metal around the camera island contrasts well with the color. The Signature gets a 6.8-inch AMOLED panel, and it comes with all the other extras that you'd normally see in a high-end phone.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XvdqAwMKaLrE66dgMnxYES" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvdqAwMKaLrE66dgMnxYES.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DdMM5YxXxcCKYVBngZ5uDS" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DdMM5YxXxcCKYVBngZ5uDS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G8V3nWKthtE2jicyQ8WTfR" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G8V3nWKthtE2jicyQ8WTfR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EjxK3mv8yH8FjvziRLE7fR" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EjxK3mv8yH8FjvziRLE7fR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N4rSBDjVh5vfyMYQxTiYBS" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N4rSBDjVh5vfyMYQxTiYBS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Now, what I particularly like with the Signature is the cameras; the phone gets a 50MP Sony Lytia LYT-828 main camera with OIS, alongside a 50MP Sony Lytia LYT-600 3x zoom lens (also with OIS), and a 50MP wide-angle lens. The cameras are the same as the Razr Fold, and the switch to Sony lenses should give the Signature a considerable advantage over yesteryear Motorola phones.</p><p>The Signature doesn't quite have the latest hardware, with Motorola choosing to go with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5 instead of the Elite. Now, while I would normally have an issue with that, I don't think it is a big downside. The 8 Gen 5 has plenty of power in its own right, and Motorola said going with the platform allowed it to lower the cost of the phone, putting it on par with the OnePlus 15 (which does have the Elite).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vKQEC6ePD52BQgG38yKmtR" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKQEC6ePD52BQgG38yKmtR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere, you get 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.1 storage, with the phone going up to 16GB/1TB should you need increased storage. The 5,200mAh battery uses Motorola's standard 90W charging tech, and the phone doesn't miss out on any of the other extras — it even gets UWB.</p><p>Motorola's software stance with the Signature is refreshing to say the least, with the phone guaranteed to get seven years of updates. I confirmed with Motorola that it means seven Android OS updates, so the phone is in line with Google and Samsung devices in this regard, and that's just great to see considering all the missteps the brand made in the past.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4XuRbcFj9QyStscGuXr6BS" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4XuRbcFj9QyStscGuXr6BS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GXZsG7Nbcxwg9y8csiiZuR" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GXZsG7Nbcxwg9y8csiiZuR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DXYAjQuNpJU7c2VGtWVbqR" name="Motorola Signature" alt="Motorola Signature hands-on testing at Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DXYAjQuNpJU7c2VGtWVbqR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>If anything, using the Signature convinced me that Motorola has a great product on its hands, and it has the potential to be an alternative to the OnePlus 15 and Galaxy S25.</p><p>There's just one issue: Motorola isn't launching the Signature in the U.S. The phone is going on sale in other global markets, where prices start at €999.

The company launched several accessories, including a Pixelsnap Ring Stand, Pixelsnap cases, and a Pixelsnap wireless charger.</p><p>The Pixelsnap charger closely resembles Apple's official MagSafe charger, featuring a circular design and an aluminum build.

Blass was quoting a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/2006658430468239377">post from @UniverseIce</a>, which mentioned that Samsung will not be changing Galaxy S26 pricing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-entire-galaxy-s26-series-could-cost-usd50-more-than-the-galaxy-s25">as previously rumored</a>.

Meanwhile, Google has opted solely for book-style foldables and Samsung has invested in both. Now, Motorola is shaking up its lineup with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold-first-impressions">introduction of the Razr Fold</a>, the company's first book-style foldable phone, which is set to launch later this year.</p><p>This gives consumers another option while allowing Motorola to cater to a different type of consumer, one that prefers the flexibility of a large tablet-like foldable phone. But with that in mind, we want to know what style foldable you prefer; the smaller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a> or the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">book-style foldable</a>?</p><div style="min-height: 250px;">                                <div class="kwizly-quiz kwizly-XbL5YW"></div>                            </div>                            <script src="https://kwizly.com/embed/XbL5YW.js" async></script><h2 id="very-different-form-factors-for-very-different-purposes-2">Very different form factors for very different purposes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3965px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qmMDRrLXfwiavZT8Tx2A3F" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qmMDRrLXfwiavZT8Tx2A3F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3965" height="2230" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there are many differences between flip phones and book-style foldables, starting with their size.</p><p>Flip phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> aim to minimize their footprint by folding in half form the size of a regular smartphone to a square-like device with an outer screen. That outer screen can be used to view notifications, and on newer, more advanced flip phones, interact with messages, open apps, take selfies, and much more. You also get the nostalgia of being able to flip the phone open or dramatically shut it closed, which is still very fun.</p><p>Meanwhile, book-style foldables, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, are geared towards productivity, media, and multitasking. They start at the size of a regular smartphone and open to something much larger and with more screen real estate. This makes it easy to run apps side-by-side, drag and drop content between apps, or open up your most-used apps directly from a task bar, not unlike a tablet or desktop.</p><p>And if you want to watch videos or draw, the larger screen is an ideal canvas for both.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="4txujVEQvBDeorsM3bCXXE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-mint-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4txujVEQvBDeorsM3bCXXE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, beyond size and use-cases, price is also a factor. Flip phones tend to be cheaper, which makes them much more accessible. It's why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-foldable-phone-failure-is-over-why-2026-is-set-to-change-everything">they have lead foldable sales for years, until recently</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, book-style foldables are much more expensive, with phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> reaching $2,000, and we're not even going into multi-fold devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">Galaxy Z TriFold</a>. Still, many consumers don't seem to mind, and larger-screen foldables are finally finding their stride as technologies improve.</p><p>But what about you? What drives you toward either form factor?

At CES 2026, they demonstrated this by launching Qira, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/youre-using-ai-all-the-time-and-might-not-even-know-it">system-level intelligence</a> that works across all your devices rather than being limited to a single app. Motorola also teased something even more ambitious: a wearable AI companion that works on its own, without your phone.</p><p>Lenovo calls this idea personal ambient intelligence, and Qira is the first real example of it. Instead of being a chatbot you only use when you think of it, Qira is built right into Lenovo and Motorola devices. It learns your habits, understands context, and helps you with tasks without needing you to manage it all the time.</p><p>This shift may seem small, but it matters. Qira works across <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a>, PCs, tablets, and wearables as one system, so you can move smoothly from one device to another. You can say “Hey, Qira,” tap a button, or press a key to use it.

After that, Motorola Qira will come to supported smartphones through over-the-air updates.

We heard some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-signature-leak-hints-at-a-no-compromises-flagship-with-seven-years-of-updates">whispers about the dedicated</a> "Signature Series" earlier this month. And it seems like this represents the company's push into the ultra-premium market, bringing unique materials and long-term software support to its devices.</p><p>The Motorola Signature is said to be 6.99mm thin and weighs only 186 grams. As for its design, the phone gets an aircraft-grade aluminum frame with a twill-inspired or linen-inspired finish on its rear panel. The phone features a large 6.8-inch Extreme AMOLED display that can reach 6,200 nits of brightness, and an ultra-fast 165Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Extending the device's longevity and slim build is the Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the phone gets an IP68 and IP69  rating, much like its mid-range and flagship "Edge" series.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.85%;"><img id="yJmae9jwoFNCCXESzLzRtV" name="Motorola-Signature-2026" alt="Motorola Signature arrives looking sleek, with 7 years of OS updates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:281,cw:3602,ch:2026,q:80/yJmae9jwoFNCCXESzLzRtV.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2026" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola )</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even though the Signature is "ultra-thin," Motorola didn't compromise on its battery life. The device sports a silicon-carbon 5,200mAh battery and supports 90W TurboPower wired charging, which is said to give users power for the day in just 7 minutes.</p><p>At its heart, the phone is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/snapdragon-8-gen-5-announced">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a>,  which is said to make daily tasks seamless, support new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI </a>features, and improve gaming. What's more is that the company is making a switch with its software update, giving the Signature the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> and promising a seven-year-long OS and security updates, on par with Pixel and Galaxy S series.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="nphGjy6EUBuqPoFhnJdsEX" name="Motorola-Signature-2026" alt="Motorola Signature arrives looking sleek, with 7 years of OS updates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:0,cw:4096,ch:2304,q:80/nphGjy6EUBuqPoFhnJdsEX.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2731" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola )</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, the Motorola Signature gets a powerful triple rear camera with 50MP cameras. The primary lens gets a Sony LYTIA 828 sensor with an f/1.6 aperture. There’s also an ultrawide lens that works as a macro lens, and a Sony LYTIA 600 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. Additionally, your selfies get sharper too, with the 50MP front camera.</p><p>"Moto AI is infused within each camera sensor, ensuring high-quality resolution, vivid colors, and reduced noise," the company's press release added.</p><p>In terms of audio, the Motorola Signature gets Dual stereo speakers that use "Sound by Bose" technology, as well as Dolby Atmos, bringing an immersive audio experience for its users.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4243px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.34%;"><img id="R2Lr3ZoiCwhVvZnh6wxNwX" name="Motorola-Signature-2026" alt="Motorola Signature arrives looking sleek, with 7 years of OS updates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:556,cw:3269,ch:1839,q:80/R2Lr3ZoiCwhVvZnh6wxNwX.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4243" height="1839" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola )</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the Motorola Signature comes in two colorways: Pantone Martini Olive and Pantone Carbon, and costs €999, which is roughly around $1,170.

This device is designed to be both a collector’s item and a practical phone.</p><p>The phone features the same hardware as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr 2025</a>, hidden beneath its custom vegan leather back. It has a 6.9-inch foldable AMOLED main display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a 3.6-inch external cover screen.</p><p>The device runs on a MediaTek Dimensity 7400X chipset and offers either 8GB or 12GB of RAM, depending on the region.</p><p>However, this phone stands out from typical designs. Its back cover is made of soft-touch vegan leather with a multicolor geometric pattern inspired by the tournament’s official branding. This is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-teases-a-world-cup-edition-razr-ahead-of-its-january-reveal">same Razr phone that Motorola teased a few days ago</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:927px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.68%;"><img id="CJjdFECVUSJyPCbLcHKSNX" name="Razr-FIFA-World-Cup-26-edition" alt="green rear panel of the Razr FIFA World Cup 26 Edition" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJjdFECVUSJyPCbLcHKSNX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="927" height="581" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The phone’s camera system features a 50MP main sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS) and Pantone-validated color tuning. Whether you are taking photos at a stadium or snapping a selfie at a watch party with the 32MP front camera, it promises good results.</p><p>The 4500mAh battery supports 30W wired and 15W wireless charging, and Motorola says it can last from "kickoff to the final whistle."</p><p>The phone has an IP48 rating, so it can handle splashes and brief drops in water, but it is not suitable for swimming. Its titanium hinge is designed for durability, but the device is not fully waterproof.</p><h2 id="the-real-game-exclusive-fifa-personalization-2">The real game: Exclusive FIFA personalization</h2><p>Where this edition truly scores is in its software experience. Motorola loaded it with FIFA-themed wallpapers, the official tournament theme as a ringtone, and a unique FIFA Watermark that fans can stamp on their photos. These touches are clearly aimed at fans who want their device to scream football during the lead-up to the 48-team tournament.</p><p>In the United States, Verizon and Total Wireless will offer the phone exclusively starting February 12. An unlocked version will be available on Motorola’s website for $700. In Canada, it will be available from motorola.ca for $1,000 on the same date.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I haven't paid much attention to Motorola's foldables; I prefer book-style devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, and Motorola just didn't cater to this category — until now. The Razr Fold is launching later this year, and Motorola showcased the device at an exclusive product briefing I attended at CES 2026.</p><p>To be honest, I wasn't quite as enthused about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold">Razr Fold</a> as my colleagues; AC managing editor Derrek Lee <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">adores his Razr Ultra</a>, and while I'll admit that Motorola makes good foldables, I didn't think the brand would have a particularly strong device as its debut effort in the book-style category. I used all the Vivo, Huawei, and Honor foldables released in the last three years, and with even Samsung and Google struggling to measure up to Chinese brands, I just figured the Razr Fold wouldn't be anywhere as good.</p><p>I was wrong — although I used the Razr Fold for just 15 minutes, I got a good sense of what Motorola is trying to achieve with the device, and I believe it may just be the ideal rival to the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 8.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MuVjVkzH9RZu39iQkuEmuH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MuVjVkzH9RZu39iQkuEmuH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aWoSzfpjU5fQ285cHNxFbH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aWoSzfpjU5fQ285cHNxFbH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xtMsZxsLqbUPMkMfCRY2uH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xtMsZxsLqbUPMkMfCRY2uH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kWUGHM3A2si2KKWfffrdyH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kWUGHM3A2si2KKWfffrdyH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The Razr Fold has a svelte design that's similar to Vivo and Samsung's foldables, and it feels just as thin as its immediate rivals. That in itself is a good starting point; this is an area where Google didn't make any measurable advances with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-pro-fold-may-not-be-the-best-foldable-but-its-the-one-i-like-the-most">Pixel 10 Pro</a>, so it's great to see Motorola opting to go with a thin-and-light design.</p><p>The brand did all the right things with the color options as well; the Pantone Lily White model has a silky finish that feels good to hold, and the Pantone Blackened Blue variant has a distinctive texture that I prefer. Another positive is the rounded edges; they make holding and using the Razr Fold that much more comfortable, and they're just as good as the X Fold 5 in this regard.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QjqhnsGoKNYJwEQeysJGXH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QjqhnsGoKNYJwEQeysJGXH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="z2xCD7fbmdb2bTg4qm2tyH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z2xCD7fbmdb2bTg4qm2tyH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wuTzro4hTKviGMzA3unJ2J" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wuTzro4hTKviGMzA3unJ2J.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d4ppUHHHtVcZzqHAVEnUgH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d4ppUHHHtVcZzqHAVEnUgH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Motorola retained a similar camera island that you'll find on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">its regular phones</a>, and again, I like how the brand preserved its unique design identity. The width of the camera island means there isn't much wobble when using the Razr Fold on a table — this was a bugbear on the Z Fold 7, and I'm glad that it isn't a problem with Motorola's foldable.</p><p>Continuing with the positives, there isn't much in the way of a visible crease along the inner panel. The hinge flexes smoothly and has good articulation, and on the whole, I didn't see any issues when it comes to the hardware design as such. Basically, if you covered up the Motorola logo and told me it was a Vivo or Honor foldable, I would've believed it — Motorola has a strong contender out of the gate with the Razr Fold.</p><p>The outer panel extends to 6.6 inches and is comfortable to hold. The inner 8.1-inch panel gets a 2K resolution, and at an initial glance, it is just as bright and vibrant as what Vivo and Samsung have to offer.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

You also get a 50MP ultrawide-angle lens that doubles as a macro lens, a 32MP camera on the outer panel, and a 20MP shooter on the inner panel.</p><p>The software itself is similar to what you get on any other Motorola phone, and the brand has additional multitasking features to make the most of the real estate. Interestingly, Motorola is debuting a stylus alongside the foldable, and while it won't be bundled with the phone, the fact that there's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-support-the-s-pen">stylus integration is a positive move</a>.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="meN8TCuFJD5PTgg6TegqAH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/meN8TCuFJD5PTgg6TegqAH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6jwTdhAA98FKfN4o5jG7VH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6jwTdhAA98FKfN4o5jG7VH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="orqqAusPni7Z2ZYEffb7FH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/orqqAusPni7Z2ZYEffb7FH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As I used the Razr Fold in a controlled setting, I wasn't able to test the cameras at all, but the foldable has a good foundation in this area.

That should make things interesting, and initial excitement around the device may just come down to how Motorola prices the foldable.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-fold-first-impressions">Motorola Razr Fold</a> was revealed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ces">CES 2026</a>, with Motorola teasing a new stylus pen alongside it, though the company didn't reveal everything.</p><p>It seems Motorola is keeping many of the specs and details under wraps, while giving us enough to get us excited. So while there's a lot we don't know about the Razr Fold, here's what we do know and what we can glean as we wait for the full launch of Motorola's first book-style foldable.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-fold-price-and-availability"><span>Motorola Razr Fold: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="C95EgMznpMpJ4NkSe62GhK" name="Motorola-Razr-Fold-official-lifestyle-1" alt="A man and woman looking at the Motorola Razr Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C95EgMznpMpJ4NkSe62GhK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1778" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola is keeping pretty mum about the pricing and availability of the Razr Fold. However, we can infer from what we've seen in the market and from Motorola's current foldables.</p><p>Regarding price, Motorola hasn't confirmed it, but we wouldn't be surprised if the phone were priced around $1,799. This would pit it directly with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> while undercutting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-why-your-next-phone-will-cost-more">rising DRAM prices</a> could affect this, but we also know that Motorola usually prefers to match or undercut its competition to make its devices more appealing.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/2008413915147800608">One rumor</a> points to Motorola taking things even further by starting prices as low as $1,500, which would be quite impressive.</p><p>As for availability, the Razr Fold will arrive later this year, with summer as the target launch date, although Motorola says we will learn more about the phone "in the coming months." That would pit the phone against Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8">Galaxy Z Fold 8</a>.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-fold-design"><span>Motorola Razr Fold: Design</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2133px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8vFwWFnsQmhv4hkW6fDajK" name="Motorola-Razr-Fold-official-lifestyle-3" alt="A woman holding the Motorola Razr Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vFwWFnsQmhv4hkW6fDajK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2133" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The design of the Razr Fold resembles a mix of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold with a dash of Motorola. The overall chassis doesn't look too different from many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> on the market. The outer 6.6-inch display appears to have a similar aspect ratio to a non-folding smartphone, while the inner 8.1-inch panel features a single camera in the top right corner. The corners are also not very rounded, with bumpers lining the inner display.</p><p>Where things differ from other foldables is the rear panel. Instead of glass, Motorola appears to be opting for vegan leather, although with seemingly different finishes for both the Pantone Blackened Blue and Pantone Lily White color options.</p><p>Motorola is also giving the Razr Fold its signature camera design, with what appears to be an aluminum housing that protrudes from the back panel. This is similar to Motorola's phones over the past few years, particularly its flagships.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tgEuC6YVQ8w6zQQjFtvFTH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tgEuC6YVQ8w6zQQjFtvFTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What we don't know is how thin the Razr Fold is. Thinness has become a major focus over the past year, particularly on foldable phones, which led to the impressive 4.6mm-thin Galaxy Z Fold 7. Fortunately, the Razr Fold looks thin enough to compete with the best of them, aside from the camera protrusion.</p><p>Another thing we notice is the button layout. While the typical power and volume buttons are present, there's also a fourth button, which is likely an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-ultra-ai-key-misses-the-mark-google-and-samsung-should-do-it-better">AI Key</a>.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-fold-specs"><span>Motorola Razr Fold: Specs</span></h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Motorola Razr Fold</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Hello UI/Android 16 (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (internal)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>8.1-inch, 2K, LTPO</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (external)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>6.6-inch</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB LPDDR5X (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>512GB or 1TB, UFS 4.1 (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p><strong>50MP Sony LYTIA sensor</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p><strong>50MP ultrawide/macro</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p><strong>50MP 3x periscope telephoto</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera (internal)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>20MP</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera (external)</p></td><td  ><p><strong>32MP</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>Dual stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos, Snapdragon Sound (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, NFC, UWB (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Side-mounted fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP48 (assumed)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery & charging</p></td><td  ><p>--</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (open)</p></td><td  ><p>--</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (closed)</p></td><td  ><p>--</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>--</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Pantone Blackened Blue, Pantone Lily White</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>So far, Motorola hasn't revealed much of the Razr Fold specs, but some have been confirmed (emboldened in the above spec sheet), including the display sizes and camera resolutions. The inner display will feature a 2K resolution, and while it's not clear what the external display resolution will be, we can probably expect a Full HD+ resolution.</p><p>As for the cameras, we're looking at a triple 50MP system with an unidentified Sony Lytia sensor for the primary camera, which will be capable of Dolby Vision recording. The ultrawide camera doubles as a macro sensor, while the telephoto sensor features 3x optical zoom. There are also two selfie cameras, with a 20MP sensor on the inner display and a 32MP sensor on the external screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kWUGHM3A2si2KKWfffrdyH" name="Motorola Razr Fold" alt="Motorola Razr Fold hands-on testing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kWUGHM3A2si2KKWfffrdyH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Everything else is assumed or unknown. Given its positioning, the foldable is expected to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>, Qualcomm's latest, along with 16GB of RAM. However, it's possible Motorola could opt for the slightly underpowered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a> to keep the price down. This would help it achieve the rumored $1,500 price tag.</p><p>Battery capacity is unknown, though we hope Motorola will take what it's learned from the Edge 70 and use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-talked-to-the-brand-thats-revolutionizing-silicon-battery-tech">silicon-carbon battery</a> for a thinner, denser pack, maybe 5,000mAh or more. It's also likely the Razr Fold will follow the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> and other flagship Motorola phones and feature 68W wired charging. Qi2-support is another unknown, however.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-fold-software"><span>Motorola Razr Fold: Software</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xgowVchHtquofMr9ziBtwK" name="Motorola-Razr-Fold-official-lifestyle-4" alt="Motorola Razr Fold folded at an angle with a keyboard and notepad on the display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xgowVchHtquofMr9ziBtwK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1778" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Motorola Razr Fold will likely run the latest version of Hello UX, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>. Given that this is the company's first book-style foldable, we expect the software to adapt to the larger internal display to make better use of the screen real estate, with features like a taskbar for pinned apps. Motorola highlights as much, noting that the Razr Fold will feature flexible layouts, adaptive interfaces, and multitasking enhancements.</p><p>Motorola also highlights AI features available on the Fold. This includes current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> features like Catch me up and Next Move, but it will likely also include Motorola Qira, the company's upgraded AI solution. This will enable features that work across devices for better productivity and contextual awareness.</p><p>That said, we hope Motorola's software update promise will grow this year. Right now, its U.S.-based phones are supported for as long as four years, while other companies promise up to seven years.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-fold-moto-pen-ultra"><span>Motorola Razr Fold: Moto Pen Ultra</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XzMKJzaAF3F8TaqKSFd3mK" name="Motorola-Razr-Fold-official-lifestyle-2" alt="A woman with a sylust pen and the Motorola Razr Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XzMKJzaAF3F8TaqKSFd3mK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1778" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola also introduced the Moto Pen Ultra, a stylus pen that can basically be seen as Motorola's version of the S Pen. Unlike the passive stylus pens that are included with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-review">Moto G Stylus</a> lineup of phones, this is an active pen with features such as tilt detection, pressure sensitivity, and even palm rejection to ensure that your sketches or other pen work go uninterrupted.</p><p>Motorola also highlights other AI-powered features, such as Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and Motorola's own Sketch to Image, to give your drawings some added flair. There's also Quick Clip, which lets you easily create a new note or add to an existing one by highlighting text, and Speed Share, which suggests who to send notes or annotations to. And like the S Pen, users can access features from a quick-access toolbar.</p><p>Motorola doesn't say how long the Moto Pen Ultra lasts on a single charge, but the carrying case can fully charge the pen if needed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company touts the stylus as a "natural extension" of one's hand. If you're one to sketch, the Pen Ultra delivers several features that artists can lean on, like its pressure sensitivity. This feature reflects your touch, similar to if you're pressing harder on your pen or pencil in real life. Moreover, users will find that tilting the pen will affect their shading and texture.</p><p>Motorola built in some protections for its Pen Ultra, stating that users who may rest their hand on their device while drawing won't have their artwork ruined, thanks to its palm-rejection technology.</p><p>If you're jotting down notes, users can document those thoughts, as well as "smart features to transform text or images."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="XoH9DUPgf8Xahf7nnsFQN" name="moto-pen-ultra-with-case-example" alt="The Motorola Pen Ultra in black with its carrying case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XoH9DUPgf8Xahf7nnsFQN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another key feature you'll find with the Pen Ultra is the "quick access toolbar." Pretty self-explanatory; however, Motorola states this bar lets users customize their pen to their liking. Users can select from a range of brushes before/during sketching and magnify their screen to add those finer details.</p><p>Elsewhere, you'll find features such as Quick Clip for highlighting content, Speed Share, Sketch to Image, and Circle to Search from Google. Motorola's Pen Ultra is a standalone accessory, meaning it will be delivered with a carrying case and a "total battery backup." Motorola claims the pen can last all day.</p><p>The Moto Pen Ultra is slated to debut in the North American market "in the coming months." Motorola states it will provide additional details during that time.</p><h2 id="moto-watch-2026-edition-2">Moto Watch, 2026 edition</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y6d4xP6RMSWdLSHtM9LoGC" name="moto-watch-2026-ces-lifestyle" alt="The Moto Watch (2026) on a model's wrist with a Volcanic ash band." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y6d4xP6RMSWdLSHtM9LoGC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8640" height="4860" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola's announcement trifecta includes a new Watch, but this one features its first partnership with Polar.</p><p>Polar is a company that excels at wearable sports and fitness technology, which gives us an inkling into where Motorola wants to lean with the Watch this year. With a round 47mm watch face, the newest Moto Watch features a 13-day battery life (depending on usage). This face is set upon a sand-blasted aluminum frame with a stainless steel crown.</p><p>Inside the device, users will find a "personal wellness companion" that is capable of logging steps, helping you manage your stress, and providing insights to understand your sleep quality. Polar's involvement is stated to "offer users deep health insights and wellness tracking solutions." Users can log their calories, track workouts (Activity Score, Activity Goal), and more.</p><p>The Moto Watch monitors your heart rate, blood oxygen, and delivers options to set/customize goals and more.</p><p>A hands-free experience greets the Moto Watch this new year with a built-in mic and speaker system. Not only does this help with its AI software, but users can take calls and receive audio notifications whenever they're not near their phone, good for those cooking or cleaning around the house.</p><p>The Moto Watch with a PANTONE Volcanic Ash band will be available on motorola.com on January 22 in the U.S.</p><h2 id="tag-2-you-re-it-and-a-sound-flow-too-2">Tag (2), you're it — and a Sound Flow, too!</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4685px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Frej3dhpTKTVTyPeHTuLLH" name="moto-tag-2-lifestyle-bicycle" alt="The Moto Tag 2 clipped onto the underside of a bicycle's seat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Frej3dhpTKTVTyPeHTuLLH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4685" height="2635" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1334px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:35.31%;"><img id="qoUYauM7pLRpHMGdEreesM" name="moto-sound-flow-bluetooth-speaker" alt="The Motorola Sound Flow Bluetooth speaker in PANTONE Carbon and Warm Taupe." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qoUYauM7pLRpHMGdEreesM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1334" height="471" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Motorola's next iteration of smart tracking is here, as the company unveiled its Moto Tag 2 at CES 2026.</p><p>Keeping its lightweight body, Motorola states its second Tag offers ~500 days of battery life, meaning you'll know where your stuff is for well over a year. Speaking of that, the Moto Tag 2 has been equipped with even more security to defend your items. The press release states that the tracker leverages Ultra-wideband (UWB) and channel-sounding technology to locate missing items. UWB comes in for precise location tracking and direction detection.</p><p>Users can lean on the Moto Tag app or Google's Find Hub to see all of their tracked devices, easily available for rediscovery.</p><p>While typically popped into a suitcase or set on a keychain, Motorola says its Tag 2 can work the opposite way to find your lost phone. Even if your phone was on silent, users can press the Tag 2's button, and it'll set off your phone's ringer. The tracker's physical button is even used as a remote camera shutter. What's more, users can share their tracker's location with trusted friends and family.</p><p>The Moto Tag 2 is headed for North America "in the coming months."</p><p>Lastly, Motorola is launching a Bluetooth speaker, paired with Bose, called the Moto Sound Flow. With Sound by Bose, the Sound Flow features a 20W subwoofer and a 10W tweeter with Dual Passive radiators. Though a surprising launch, Motorola isn't holding anything back, stating the speaker features Room Shift, Quick Switch, Dynamic Stereo, Stereo Pairing, and Hands-free calling.</p><p>Additionally, there are captive touch buttons on the speaker.</p><p>Users can easily cast to the Sound Flow via Google Cast, Spotify Connect, and AirPlay. For those long jam sessions, the speaker features a 6,000mAh battery, which is estimated to last up to 12 hours.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Lenovo claims up to 11 hours of battery life on a single charge.</p><p>Designed for both education and personal use, the Chromebook Plus 15" i meets MIL-STD-810H durability standards. Lenovo says the Chromebook Plus will launch in Q2 2026 with a starting price of $470.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7aGf97txY7BDT85cgNKfTb" name="lenovo-yoga-pro-9i-ces-2026" alt="Lenovo Yoga 9i Pro main image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7aGf97txY7BDT85cgNKfTb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond Chromebooks, Lenovo also refreshed its Yoga and ThinkPad series, which run Windows out of the box.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The CES tech spectacle is always a glimpse at the future. But this morning, in an ordinary hotel suite in Las Vegas, I took a first-hand look at it. The spectacles, that is.</p><p>Lumus is the pioneering Israeli company behind geometric waveguide tech – partially reflecting mirrors that are embedded in regular lenses. While VR headsets are immersive, they’re often heavy, and hard to imagine wearing for more than an hour or two. In contrast, Lumus transforms the ordinary lens in your eyeglasses into full-color displays capable of moving images that dance right before your eyes.</p><p>I met Lumus almost exactly three years ago, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/eyes-on-with-lumus-z-lens-the-mind-blowing-future-of-ar-glasses"><u>was blown away at the time</u></a> by the tech. Meta’s Ray-Bans are the product that finally emerged from that demo I saw in 2023; but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Bans</a> have a field of view that’s only 20 degrees. Sure, the AR glasses are cool, but the tech only fills a small portion of the screen.</p><p>Today, Lumus announced an updated version of its lens, expanding the field of view to 20 degrees, as well as the Z30 2.0, the next-generation version of its waveguide product, with a whopping 70-degree field of view.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.37%;"><img id="PGjLJSFLxgDnSXnM5b6aah" name="lumus glass lense" alt="lense of the lumus glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PGjLJSFLxgDnSXnM5b6aah.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="962" height="1283" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Future versions of Lumus’s waveguides will be even thinner, with smaller projectors, allowing for remarkably lightweight AR glasses. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeremy Kaplan/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On a table before me were three different prototypes, each with wires and cables protruding from the stems and connected to computers like a printer or a scanner. Held together with masking tape, they were clearly extremely costly early prototypes. With a prayer for steady hands, I put one on and instantly floating sugarplums danced before my eyes: full color videos, giant photographs and cartoons, tiny type that was still perfectly legible, and more. Heck, you could probably game on these things.</p><p>“And we haven’t even optimized it yet,” Dave Goldman, VP of marketing for the Israeli-based Lumus, joked with me. “This is the worst it will ever be.” If this is the worst, the future looks very bright indeed. The new lenses are capable of 8,000 nits to the watt, a measure of efficiency that essentially means it’s very bright – readable in daylight, in other words.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.37%;"><img id="v4A8ffyS2mGvzvSGCEEjCn" name="lumus glass lense" alt="Lumus AR glasses lens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v4A8ffyS2mGvzvSGCEEjCn.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="962" height="1283" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Dave Goldman, VP of marketing for Lumus, shows off the impossibly thin waveguides his company plans for future AR glasses. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeremy Kaplan/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One nifty by-product of the waveform tech is discretion: While I could perfectly see the images before me, you can’t: Another person looking at you simply sees someone in glasses. You’re the only one looking at the Matrix, in other words.</p><p>Beyond improving the tech, Lumus is working to reduce the thickness of its lenses – sorry, <em>waveguides</em> – to enable lighter, thinner glasses.</p><p>“That’s the future for us – making these waveguides thinner, lighter, and easier to produce,” Goldman said. And the future looks bright indeed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Moto will be in the unique position of selling cheap fitness watches with disproportionately high-end health & fitness insights, which will help Moto Watches stand out.</p><p>In fact, given that Polar watches have become much more expensive in the U.S. due to tariffs, the new Moto Watch could be a more accessible way to access these insights, competing with budget running watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros/i-tested-the-coros-pace-4-and-its-new-best-cheap-running-watch-of-2025">COROS PACE 4</a>.</p><p>If Moto Watches will use the Polar Flow app, new users may find it a bit overwhelming or archaic, but Polar promised last year that it's in the midst of revamping its app to be more "dynamic and data-centric," sharing the sample screenshots above. This app redesign should help both Polar and Moto watches.</p><p>Overall, Moto watches "powered by Polar" sound intriguing, but the question will be whether Motorola phone buyers will buy a sporty, long-lived Moto Watch with limited Android smarts, or if they'd prefer a shorter-lived Moto 360 successor.</p><p>Polar, meanwhile, gets its first major licensing partner since Casio started using Polar insights in its watches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polar.com/en/media-room/polar-fitness-algorithms-available-for-partners?srsltid=AfmBOorPUB_JLHdkeGs704YmpN9lbYZzbzh2NsgusQDuZu37bFcRBRnJ">in 2023</a>, a significant win for the brand.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Its press release explains that users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://solosglasses.com/">get in on the sales now,</a> and choose from an assortment of frame colors. Solos states that it plans to "expand" the retail availability of the AirGo V2 "in early 2026." Moreover, the smart glasses are set to receive a portable charging case; however, consumers will not find it alongside the device when purchasing.</p><p>Solos says that consumers will have to wait a little longer for that, until roughly around Q2 2026. The "final price" for this charger will be determined around its intended launch date, according to Solos.</p><p>This case was debuted at CES 2026, to which Solos stated it would feature a 1,100mAh battery. Additionally, the company stated that its SmartHinge modular design will enable "continuous, multi-day use by allowing battery temples to be swapped while charging.</p><p>There's much to see (no pun intended) with the Solos AirGo V2, but its AI software is an unsurprising highlight. The post states that the device features "multimodal AI interactions" across "image, video, audio, and text." Solos leverages AI capabilities from the likes of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek. With that, the glasses can "identify" objects, translate text, answer user queries, and more, all wrapped in a hands-free package.</p><h2 id="going-solo-s-2">Going Solo(s)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yREC6fov8FAz2pP5GMjpjQ" name="Solos-AirGo-V2" alt="black Solos AirGo V2 smart glasses against a white background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yREC6fov8FAz2pP5GMjpjQ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4800" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Solos)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Solos also focused on a more accessible AI with the AirGo V2, showing an interest in bringing its features to blind and low-vision users. The AirGo V2 is expected to get these features for the previously mentioned users "later this year." The camera that gets this done is a 16MP lens, reportedly capable of capturing high-res photos and Full HD video recordings.</p><p>Solos' newest glasses aren't making a total debut at CES 2026 this week, as the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/solos-unveils-two-smart-glasses-that-might-actually-be-worth-wearing">originally debuted them back in June</a> 2025. The company showcased the AirGo V2, alongside the AirGo V5, with designs that make them resemble glasses sans the "smart." The company reported that its V2 model sports live video stabilization, as well as low-power Wi-Fi. SolosChat 3.0 essentially handles all of the hands-free capabilities users may enjoy, leaning into video, voice, and more to understand what you require.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It uses a matte display with a DC-dimmed LED backlight and blue light filtering for an eye-friendly viewing experience. The phone sports the NXTPAPER Key, a physical switch that can change viewing modes. There is a standard color mode, plus three NXTPAPER modes: Color Paper Mode, Ink Paper Mode, and Max Ink Mode.</p><p>Color Paper Mode preserves a touch of muted color with a paper-like appearance, while Ink Paper Mode provides black-and-white visuals. Max Ink Mode is a more robust monochrome viewing option that extends battery life while limiting apps and notifications.

After lying dormant without significant updates for years, Google shipped a major Snapseed 3.0 release in June 2025 with a redesigned editor and grid photo layout. Regular updates keep coming in, but only for the iOS app, with the latest one introducing a "Snapseed Camera" feature with retro film filters.</p><p>It's safe to say that Snapseed is officially back.

At a time when filters and nostalgic, anti-processing camera apps like Zerocam or Halide Process Zero are gaining buzz, Snapseed has the potential to be something special.</p><p>When Snapseed's latest updates start making their way to the Android app in a few months, I'll immediately start using it on my Android phones — and it seems like a perfect match for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Google Pixels</a>.</p><h2 id="snapseed-for-ios-is-now-a-revamped-photo-editor-2">Snapseed for iOS is now a revamped photo editor</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vr3ceG72roGUDotvGhBjhe" name="Snapseed-4" alt="The Snapseed app for iOS on an iPhone Air." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vr3ceG72roGUDotvGhBjhe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's update to Snapseed for iOS last year took us by surprise, and the improvements were tangible. The app gained a minimalist Google design language — somewhat opposite of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a> — with a refreshed iOS icon and a clean photo grid UI. After selecting a photo, you can edit it using three tabs: <strong>Looks</strong>, <strong>Faves</strong>, and <strong>Tools</strong>.</p><p>The new Faves tab holds specific tools you've added as favorites for rapid access. It replaces the former <strong>Export</strong> tab in the old UI, with the Tools tab shifting right to make way for Faves in the center. A share button is now available in the top-right corner to handle the <strong>Save to original </strong>(replaces the original image with your edits that can be reverted), <strong>Save copy</strong> (adds duplicate image with your edits that can be reverted), and <strong>Export </strong>(makes a copy with permanent changes you can't revert) options.</p><p>There are more than 25 tools available in the Snapseed editor across four categories: <strong>Adjust & Correct</strong>, <strong>Retouch & Transform</strong>, <strong>Style</strong>, and <strong>Creative</strong>.</p><p>What's interesting about Snapseed as a photo editor is that it blends professional-grade tools with easy-to-use and shareable filters. One one end, you have RAW editing support and color correction curves. On the other, there are film filters that feel like a blast from the past of social media's early days. It's accessible to all and feels easier to navigate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-google-photos-ai-editing-tools">than the Google Photos editor</a>.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-fun-camera-with-film-filters-too-2">It's a fun camera with film filters, too</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FbaGNVqMSpiTk93PK4EEde" name="Snapseed-1" alt="The Snapseed app for iOS on an iPhone Air." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FbaGNVqMSpiTk93PK4EEde.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The newest update, version 3.11, adds the "Snapseed Camera" — a retro point-and-shoot capture tool featuring film filters inspired by authentic stocks from brands like Kodak, Fujifilm, and Polaroid. The update began rolling out last month with the interactive, skeuomorphic viewfinder (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2026/01/05/snapseed-camera-iphone-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>It's somewhat difficult to access the Snapseed Camera if you don't know how to reveal it. There isn't a button in the Snapseed app that opens the Snapseed Camera. This keeps the main app a photo editor first and foremost. However, those that want to play around with the Snapseed Camera can add a Control Center toggle or change their Camera Control default camera app to Snapseed.</p><p>When you first try out the Snapseed Camera, it'll let you know that the selected film style and strength is rendered in the viewfinder in real time. The film grain, though, is rendered after the photo is taken. You can switch films, enable color themes, and control your camera flash to personalize the look of your film-esque photos. The camera functionality supports both the selfie and rear cameras.</p><p>Here's the full list of film styles available in the Snapseed Camera:</p><ul><li><strong>KP1</strong>: Inspired by Kodak Portra 400</li><li><strong>KP2</strong>: Inspired by Kodak Portra 160</li><li><strong>KG1</strong>: Inspired by Kodak Gold 200</li><li><strong>KE1</strong>: Inspired by Kodak E200</li><li><strong>FS1</strong>: Inspired by Fuji Superia 200</li><li><strong>FS2</strong>: Inspired by Fuji Superia 800</li><li><strong>FP1</strong>: Inspired by Fuji Pro 400h</li><li><strong>AG1</strong>: Inspired by Agfa Optima 200</li><li><strong>AS1</strong>: Inspired by Agfa Scala 200</li><li><strong>PD1</strong>: Inspired by Polaroid 600</li><li><strong>TC1</strong>: Inspired by Technicolor</li></ul><p>More so than the photo editing features, the Snapseed Camera is where Google can really make its mark with the revamped Snapseed app.</p><p>We're living at a time when people are craving nostalgia, and things like record players and film cameras are making a comeback. Brand-new cameras like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shopusa.fujifilm-x.com/x-half-x-half/" target="_blank">Fuji X Half</a> are coming out with the sole purpose of facilitating intentional photography habits and styles that resemble film. The Snapseed Camera does the exact same thing, with a fantastic interface and the hardware you already own.</p><h2 id="yes-google-cares-about-snapseed-for-android-2">Yes, Google cares about Snapseed for Android</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WDUi6VC7kncCGgP2h6cFse" name="Snapseed-3" alt="The Snapseed app for iOS on an iPhone Air." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WDUi6VC7kncCGgP2h6cFse.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's easy for Android users to see Snapseed receive updates for iOS and feel left out. I've seen plenty of theories for why Google has prioritized Apple devices in the early relaunch of Snapseed, and frankly, they're all just speculation. Google started with iOS for reasons unknown, but the process of updating Snapseed for Android is currently underway.</p><p>Giles Ochs, the product manager for Snapseed, confirmed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/snapseed/comments/1pwjrod/thanks_happy_holidays_and_a_note_on_android/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> last month that the team began work on updating the Android app in November 2025. "While we’re still a few months away from you all seeing updates, please stay tuned," Ochs wrote. "For all the Android users, please let us know if there is anything that you’d really like to see in the app."</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/snapseed/comments/1pwjrod/thanks_happy_holidays_and_a_note_on_android">Thanks, happy holidays and a note on Android</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/snapseed">r/snapseed</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>So, that makes it official. While Android users will need to wait a few more months before getting the upgraded Snapseed app, they can rest easy knowing updates are coming eventually. I couldn't be more excited to try out the revamped Snapseed editor and film camera on Android phones later in 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company keeps developing new ways to use the brand's first monocular display glasses, but it also seemingly can't make enough of them.</p><p>On the brighter side, Meta is adding two new features to Ray-Ban Display that show off the best of what the glasses and the included Meta Neural Band can do. Teleprompter support and virtual EMG handwriting are both beginning to roll out this week. The company is also working with Garmin on a new proof-of-concept. This time, instead of integrating with your smartwatch, Meta glasses might connect with your car.</p><p>These CES announcements both show how much potential there is for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a>, and also, just how far away they are from becoming a mainstream hit.</p><h2 id="meta-s-showing-off-major-new-ray-ban-display-features-at-ces-2026-2">Meta's showing off major new Ray-Ban Display features at CES 2026</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:750px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="DNhqdksBdfCoK5sSP6J2Ac" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Teleprompter" alt="The new teleprompter feature arriving on Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses following CES 2026." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DNhqdksBdfCoK5sSP6J2Ac.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="750" height="422" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To me, the most exciting Meta Ray-Ban Display upgrade is teleprompter support. It's exactly what it sounds like — these display glasses can show a script in the right monocular lens to keep you on track during a speech or event. The idea is that Ray-Ban Display's teleprompter gives public speakers the best of both worlds. They get to maintain direct eye contact with their audience while still enjoying the comfort of notes or a script.</p><p>The teleprompter feed appears on the Ray-Ban Display glasses in text-based cards, which kind of resemble notification bubbles. Speakers advance the teleprompter using gestures with the Meta Neural Band. The teleprompter interface also displays the current time and a running timer that shows how long you've been speaking.</p><p>At its core, the Meta Ray-Ban Display teleprompter is simple, accepting pasted text from any external source. That could be a Google Doc, a note in Google Keep, or something generated with an AI chatbot. Teleprompter support feels like it could be the "killer feature" for XR display glasses. It's the first tool that makes me think "wow, I need that."</p><p>Meta says a phased rollout of this feature will begin this week.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="uApRCUqUG7AcuMeKCgCHnm" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-glasses-close-up-back-view" alt="A photo of Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, taken to show how it looks from the back looking through the lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uApRCUqUG7AcuMeKCgCHnm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Using the Meta Neural Band, the company is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-will-get-virtual-handwriting-based-on-neural-signals">rolling out EMG handwriting</a> to early access testers starting today. By drawing words with their finger on any surface while wearing the EMG wristband, Meta Ray-Ban Display owners can input text for their glasses. Meta says its Neural Band is the "only wrist device that enables handwriting on any surface."</p><p>The feature is limited to writing WhatsApp and Messenger chats for now, and only works in the U.S. with the device language set to English.</p><p>Looking ahead, Meta worked with Garmin to create an automotive proof of concept. It bridges Meta Neural Band to the Garmin Unified Cabin, which manages car infotainment systems. In simple terms, Meta is exploring using an EMG wristband to control you car's entertainment screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:750px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NqPiJCvLAmYxzFKZz9NiAc" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-Garmin-Unified-Cabin" alt="The new Garmin Unified Cabin proof of concept on Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses shown off at CES 2026." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NqPiJCvLAmYxzFKZz9NiAc.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="750" height="422" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Once you start using the band regularly, you want it to control more than just your AI glasses.

The company noted its focus is on fulfilling U.S. orders for now, and that it is re-evaluating its approach to international availability.</p><h2 id="where-does-meta-ray-ban-display-go-from-here-2">Where does Meta Ray-Ban Display go from here?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="omL7pKjmvtMjvyiLqb7aSc" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-smart-glasses-brown" alt="Photo of the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses on display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/omL7pKjmvtMjvyiLqb7aSc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My main takeaway is not the so-called "unprecedented demand" for Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses or the international delay itself. Instead, what stands out is Meta's clear focus and commitment to AR glasses technology.</p><p>Just a few months after their launch, the company is already upgrading the Ray-Ban Display glasses with groundbreaking features like teleprompter support and EMG handwriting. It also added four new supported cities to the glasses' walking directions mode, with more cities "coming soon." Beyond the features and concepts we've already discussed, Meta is also collaborating with the University of Utah to test accessibility applications for the Meta Neural Band in smart home use cases.</p><p>Meta is attacking AR glasses development from all angles, and that's a promising sign. The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses were never meant to be a best-selling commercial success; these monocular display glasses are an early adopter product in every sense. That's why you shouldn't read into the "unprecedented demand," because Meta itself alluded to the fact that there simply aren't that many units available for sale.</p><p>The hit Meta display glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-reportedly-pushes-the-release-of-new-mixed-reality-glasses-to-2027">are the next one</a>, which hopefully have screens in both lenses. Based on what I'm seeing so far, Meta is still the one to beat in this segment. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="anbdroid xr glasses andorid central">Samsung and Google want to change that with Android XR</a>, though.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Although ASUS isn't throwing in the towel on smartphones entirely, the brand's official statements suggest that in a best-case scenario, it'll be another 12 months before we see another ASUS phone.</p><p>The news came to light after a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20260102PD236/smartphone-asus-taiwan-mobile-market.html" target="_blank">DigiTimes</a> report claimed ASUS would cease launching new Android phones after Dec. 31, 2025. The company stopped short of confirming its smartphone business is gone for good, but in a rare move, it said there are "currently" no plans for new models this year.</p><p>Regardless of what happens in the long run, I'm going to miss ASUS phones. Models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro</a> and earlier Zenfone generations broke from the norm in ways few others did. At the same time, the high price of ASUS smartphones, meager software support, and limited availability made them noncompetitive outside of niche circles. Here's what we know about the state of ASUS' smartphone division, how we may have gotten here, and what I hope comes next.</p><h2 id="asus-won-t-make-new-zenfone-or-rog-phone-models-this-year-2">ASUS won't make new Zenfone or ROG Phone models this year</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5imQbP893a9LmBQrLgmFCk" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-29.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5imQbP893a9LmBQrLgmFCk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The DigiTimes report cites Taiwanese smartphone distributors who became unable to acquire ASUS phones through usual channels, and further alleged that their available information suggested the company's mobile operations would only continue through the end of December 2025.</p><p>The publication contacted ASUS, which said it "clearly communicated to telecom channels that its smartphone operations will continue and that maintenance, software upgrades, and warranty services for all existing products will not be affected."</p><p>Then, there's the catch — ASUS <em>also</em> told DigiTimes that it "currently has no plans to introduce new smartphone models in 2026." At the same time, the company doubled down on the fact that it would "maintain its current operating model." It's fairly uncommon for a smartphone manufacturer to go an entire year without releasing new models, though.</p><p>If ASUS remains firm in its estimation that it will not release a new phone in 2026, it'll go more than two years (26 months, to be exact) without an ASUS ROG Phone series refresh, at the very least. Assuming January 2027 would be the earliest ASUS could launch upgraded smartphones, we'd also go nearly two years without a new Zenfone.</p><p>In a best-case scenario based on the available information, both of ASUS' flagship smartphone lineups would have effectively skipped two generations. That is, if we take ASUS' word that its smartphone operations are not nearing an end.</p><h2 id="asus-claims-it-isn-t-done-in-the-smartphone-market-but-i-m-skeptical-2">ASUS claims it isn't done in the smartphone market, but I'm skeptical</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pzjtDwkMf29Uvm4q2gF3VR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra about details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzjtDwkMf29Uvm4q2gF3VR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Taking what is effectively a two-year hiatus from releasing smartphones feels tough for a company to come back from. While the brand's statement claims smartphone operations will continue, it doesn't explicitly state that new models will be released beyond 2026. Instead, ASUS' comments to DigiTimes focuses on things like "comprehensive after-sales support" that includes "warranty coverage and software updates."</p><p>In other words, ASUS wants customers to know that the company isn't going to abandon them — software support promises and warranty coverage will be honored. In fact, the company shipped major software updates to recent models as recently as November 2025. That's when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus/asus-rog-phone-9-and-zenfone-12-ultra-users-can-now-upgrade-to-android-16">Android 16 arrived for the ROG Phone 9</a>, ROG Phone 9 Pro, and the Zenfone 12 Ultra.</p><p>It's certainly possible that ASUS bounces back stronger than ever in 2027, but it's also possible that the company is slowly shuttering its smartphone business. Growth in a competitive space is hard to achieve without flashy new offerings, and the problems ASUS faced — which may have included limited regional and cellular carrier availability — will likely still be problems post-2026.</p><h2 id="the-loss-of-asus-phones-temporary-or-permanent-is-disappointing-2">The loss of ASUS phones, temporary or permanent, is disappointing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="x2aWGzGgHVHFhdUKbX4aXf" name="asus-rog-phone-9-pro-10.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x2aWGzGgHVHFhdUKbX4aXf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">One of two USB-C ports on the ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I can't say I'm completely stunned by this decision, because I've found some of ASUS' smartphone decisions over the past few years to be perplexing.</p><p>The biggest one was the choice to convert the Zenfone line from a unique set of small flagship phones to "Ultra" variants in larger form factors. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-10-review">ASUS Zenfone 10</a> was the last 5.9-inch phone with premium hardware and few compromises. Now, the Zenfone 12 Ultra has a 6.78-inch screen and little differentiating characteristics to separate it from every other flagship.</p><p>Another questionable move was going all-in on the $1,000+ sector of the smartphone market. More specifically, chasing high-end flagship sales without providing a premium experience to match the price point. Phones costing that much with only two guaranteed Android OS upgrades are nearly dead-on-arrival when Samsung and Google are offering seven.</p><p>Still, ASUS deserves praise for having the courage to try new things, even if it didn't always see them through. It made small phones at a time when every other brand had left them behind. Similarly, it put multiple USB-C ports on ROG Phone models for years, helping the lineup develop an identity as a gaming-focused Android phone for power users.</p><p>I hope this isn't the end of ASUS phones, because if it isn't trying crazy things, who will? As someone who asked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/consumer-audio-industry-2026-what-we-expect-want-to-see">for more dual USB-C port phones in 2026</a>, the loss of a new ROG Phone means my yearly wishlist is off to a bad start.</p> ]]></dc:content>

V homeOS is a new operating system for Hisense that will compete with other first-party smart TV OSes, like Samsung's Tizen OS or LG's Web OS. In a separate move, TCL also revealed it will bring the Xbox app to its X11L series of Google TV-powered televisions later this year.</p><p>"This partnership is all about giving you more freedom and flexibility to play how you want," Xbox said of its deal with Hisense and V homeOS. "Xbox Game Pass subscribers – including Ultimate, Premium, and Essential subscribers – will be able to stream hundreds of games, from new releases to fan favorites, directly through the Xbox app on supported TVs via Xbox Cloud Gaming."</p><p>Meanwhile, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.tcl.com/blogs/press-releases/tcl-unveils-x11l-series-sqd-mini-led-tv-at-ces-2026-delivering-ultimate-performance-with-an-all-new-level-of-accurate-color" target="_blank">press release</a> for TCL's new X11L SQD-Mini LED series of smart TVs, the company revealed it too will gain support for Xbox Cloud Gaming later this year.

Samsung is expected to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 series</a> in late February, and it may be the first smartphone brand to raise prices to account for these supply chain concerns. The Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fnnews.com/news/202601051232528974" target="_blank">FNNews</a> reports that Samsung will raise the price of the entire Galaxy S26 series, citing an internal policy (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/jukan05/status/2008078037146091886" target="_blank">Jukan on X</a>).</p><p>The report says Samsung is planning a price hike of between 44,000 won to 88,000 won ($30 to $50) for each Galaxy S26 model. This price increase is reportedly for the 256GB variant of every device, which is set to become the base configuration across the lineup for the first time. So, while the base Galaxy S26 and Galaxy S26 could receive a price hike, buyers would also get double the storage.</p><p>Apple started this trend with the iPhone 17, making 256GB of storage available on the base model without raising prices. As such, Samsung may be feeling pressure to match Apple's precedent on the upcoming Galaxy S26 series. While Samsung didn't raise prices on the Galaxy S24 or Galaxy S25 in the U.S., the company could be adverse to doing so in order to remain competitive.</p><p>"However, in order to promote global sales, Samsung Electronics is considering setting the same price in major countries such as the United States as the previous one," the report acknowledges (translated).</p><p>In addition to potentially raising prices, Samsung's Galaxy S26 lineup could play it safe as a cost-cutting measures. While early leaks suggested Samsung might ambitiously replace the standard Galaxy S26 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-vs-galaxy-s25">an upgraded Galaxy S26 Pro model</a> and the Galaxy S26 Plus with a Galaxy S26 Edge, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/-may-not-be-an-s26-pro-either">those plans have seemingly been scrapped</a>. Outside of minor spec bumps, the Galaxy S26 could end up feeling similar to the Galaxy S25.</p><p>While Samsung has typically revealed new devices in January with February launches, expect the release schedule to be later this year. The above report reveals that Samsung could unveil the new smartphones on Feb. 25, 2026, with availability coming the following month.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While most companies are trying to fit displays into lenses, Rokid chose to focus on AI, camera features, and comfort for day-long comfort.</p><p>Display technology has arguably been the main challenge for smart glasses. Screens make them heavier, drain the battery more, and are uncomfortable to use for long periods. Rokid’s answer is simple: take out the display and rely on AI. The Style glasses weigh only 38.5 grams, making them feel more like regular spectacles than most other smart glasses.</p><h2 id="ai-does-the-heavy-lifting-instead-of-visuals-2">AI does the heavy lifting instead of visuals</h2><p>Rokid puts real-world help first instead of focusing on visuals. A 12MP Sony camera handles photos and videos, including vertical shots for social media. That means you can grab a clip or snap a photo without pulling out your phone or repositioning later.</p><p>The glasses have built-in microphones and open-ear speakers, so you can use AI assistants like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/signs-in-chatgpts-code-suggest-android-users-are-in-for-an-influx-of-ads">ChatGPT</a> and DeepSeek.

The NXP RT600 chip manages low-power tasks, and Qualcomm’s AR1 platform takes care of AI and imaging.</p><p>Rokid says the battery can last up to 12 hours with normal use. Audio plays through speakers in the arms, so you can hear responses or notifications and still stay aware of what’s around you.</p><p>Design-wise, Rokid clearly wants Style to blend in. The frames support prescription lenses, including transition and tinted options, and the lenses are thin and scratch-resistant.</p><p>This isn’t Rokid’s first attempt at smart glasses, but it is its most consumer-friendly one yet. Previous models experimented with displays and QR-style interfaces, aimed more at enterprise or niche use cases.</p><p>Pre-orders are open via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.rokid.com/products/rokid-ai-glasses-style-pre-order-benefits" target="_blank">Rokid's website</a> with a non-refundable deposit.

It's unclear whether the Galaxy Buds 4 series will launch alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 series</a> at Samsung's next major event, but there are many signs pointing to the earbuds being in active development. Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-4-pro-color-leak-3629731/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has uncovered a new colorway for the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro hidden in a recent One UI 8.5 beta update.</p><p>The site found media images for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/the-samsung-galaxy-buds-4-pro-leaks-dont-impress-me">Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 Pro</a> colorways inside the third One UI 8.5 beta update, and they show off the classic black/gray and silver/white color options. These are the same colorways currently available for the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>. However, there's a third option for the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro — called "Apricot" — that might add a bit of color to Samsung's upcoming earbuds.</p><p>The leaked Apricot colorway includes a pink plastic chassis and matching pink ear tips. There's also a metallic stem with a brushed rose gold finish (or, that's at least how it appears from the renders). Android Authority surmises the Apricot color will be a Galaxy Buds 4 Pro exclusive, since there were no matching renders for the base Galaxy Buds 4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1350px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.00%;"><img id="WNHhHaTkK99fF7XhveN6bc" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-4-Pro-apricot-android-authority" alt="The leaked colorways for the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WNHhHaTkK99fF7XhveN6bc.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1350" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 series, which now includes the Galaxy Buds 3 FE, the Galaxy Buds 3, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, plays it safe in terms of color options. The colorways across the board utilize standard shades of black, white, and the occasional mix of silver or gray. This might change with the pink and rose gold hues that could appear on the Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 Pro.</p><p>Samsung's older earbuds haven't shied away from flashy colors, though. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 2, Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, and even the forgotten Galaxy Buds Live have been offered in unique styles.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see which Samsung Galaxy Buds 4 or Galaxy Buds 4 Pro colorways are available when they are officially revealed. For now, the appearance of Apricot renders in official One UI 8.5 beta builds is a good sign that we may get a pink pair of Samsung earbuds soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The experimental tool makes it possible for users to generate custom AI backgrounds for lyric cards as an alternative to a solid color. After generating an AI image, users can save the finished lyric card to their device or share it with third-party apps.</p><p>YouTube Music's AI-generated lyric card backgrounds are widely available across both free and Premium accounts on iOS and Android, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2026/01/05/youtube-music-lyrics-ai-share/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. When viewing lyrics for a song in the YouTube Music app, the <strong>Share</strong> floating action button now has a Gemini sparkle icon, signifying the new AI-powered capabilities.</p><p>YouTube Music warns that you are "Creating with AI" when generating backgrounds, adding that "AI-generated images are based on text prompts and may sometimes fail to follow YouTube's policies, so use discretion before using them." You have to hit <strong>Accept</strong> to acknowledge these warnings the first time you try to create a song lyric background with AI.</p><p>When beginning to share a lyric card, a new AI background button will appear mixed in with the existing solid colors. After generating an image, which can take a few seconds, the button will turn into a refresh icon that'll give you the option of regenerating a new background.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eySTPvwj32xrLGL2CRGQyQ" name="YouTube-AI-Lyrics-2" alt="The YouTube Music AI-generated lyric backgrounds." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eySTPvwj32xrLGL2CRGQyQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The backgrounds generated with AI add a bit of variety to YouTube Music lyric cards.

However, the AI-generated backgrounds don't always match the theme of the song or the content of the lyrics.</p><p>YouTube Music's lyric cards include a miniature version of the song's album art, the track title, and the artist name. There's a large YouTube Music logo, and you'll now have the choice of either a solid-color background or an AI-generated one.</p><p>You can try out the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-youtube-music-ai-hosts">AI-powered YouTube Music feature</a> now in the iOS or Android app.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung has a leg up in this area thanks to its vertical integration, and its position as the number one foldable manufacturer works to its benefit. Having a creaseless panel would be a definite bonus on the Z Fold 8, and while we still have several months to go before the foldable makes its debut, I'm excited to see what it has to offer.</p> ]]></dc:content>

"Foldy Bird," a Flappy Bird clone, uses the hinge on your foldable phone as a mobile game controller. You keep folding your phone to fly the Foldy Bird, avoiding the green pipes to earn a high score. It takes a game concept that was already addictive and obsessive and makes it even more so — rather than tapping the screen, players need to physically fold their display to keep their bird alive.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i made a flappy bird clone that uses your folding phone as the controller pic.twitter.com/e0HHnLcx7T<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/2007198231479103611">January 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The game is a clever project, and it's one Rebane says was built in an hour without using AI.

However, it requires a foldable phone to play, and only works in the Chrome browser for Android. The game doesn't require any tapping — users need to fold their device to start, play, and retry.</p><p>The game's instructions warn to "play this game at your own risk and only on your own devices." That's because, as fun as this creation is, it probably puts you on a fast track to breaking your phone. Foldables are rated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-trifold-durability-test">to survive a few hundred thousand folds</a>, but they're not designed for forceful and quick folds in rapid succession. If your foldable doesn't break from playing the game, it might break from rage when you inevitably crash your bird into a pipe.</p><p>If you have a foldable, Foldy Bird is certainly worth trying. It's hard to think of a more clever use of a folding display mechanism than as a mobile game controller.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, Luna, the same brand that launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/noise-luna-ring-review">affordable smart ring</a> about a year ago, has unveiled its new Whoop competitor.</p><p>The company is calling it the Luna Band and a wearable designed to deliver "real-time, voice-led health guidance." Luna says the Luna Band is not focused on simply displaying data, but on offering timely and actionable insights.</p><p>The device looks similar to others in this category, with a metallic casing that holds the sensors and battery underneath, collecting health data and syncing it to your phone where you can view stats and guidance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ipgxaHAnCSGFBiDKQ6u56V" name="luna-band-colors" alt="Luna Band colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ipgxaHAnCSGFBiDKQ6u56V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Luna)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What sets the Luna Band apart is the company's focus on hands-free, voice-led interactions. Luna says users will be able to log meals, emotional context, and even request health guidance entirely through voice input without opening the app, using Siri-powered interactions on iOS. There's no word on this will work on Android devices, for now.</p><p>The fitness tracker runs on the company's own operating system called LifeOS, which, according to the brand, processes thousands of physiological signals per minute. Luna says LifeOS detects changes in recovery, stress, circadian alignment, and hormonal patterns, delivering context-aware recommendations throughout the day.</p><p>The Luna Band uses a "research-grade" optical sensor array paired with a high-fidelity 6-axis IMU. Luna claims this setup can detect subtle patterns like micro-recovery periods, circadian fluctuations, and emotional stress signatures that similar wearables often miss.</p><p>I haven't gone hands on with the device yet, but overall it looks very similar to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-years-resolutions-starter-kit">band-style fitness trackers</a>, such as Whoop 5.0 and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfi-balance-2-helio-strap-combo-elevated-features-launch">Amazfit's Helio Strap</a>, but with a stronger emphasis on turning data into actionable guidance rather than just presenting raw stats.</p><p>Luna has not announced pricing or availability for the Luna Band yet, but the company says the device will launch without any subscription fees later this year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

PC gaming handhelds (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/android-gaming-handhelds-are-having-their-steam-deck-moment">and Android gaming devices, too</a>) provide power and portability, while display glasses let you view your games on a virtual big screen looking straight ahead for ergonomics. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/lenovo-glasses-t1-announcement">Lenovo showed off this concept</a> with the Legion Glasses Gen 2, but now, Asus and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal</a> are partnering to take gaming display glasses to the next level at CES 2026.</p><p>They're called the ROG XREAL R1 AR, and these display glasses use 240Hz micro-OLED 1080p displays. Asus and Xreal says these are the first gaming glasses to ever meet these specifications. For comparison, the Legion Glasses Gen 2 max out at 120Hz, while the ROG XREAL R1 can supply a refresh rate twice as fast. The glasses can project a 171-inch virtual screen from about 13 feet away, with a 57-degree field-of-view.</p><p>The glasses come with an ROG Control Dock to manage compatibility with a variety of device types, from gaming PCs and handhelds to consoles or Android phones. Of course, the gaming glasses are optimized for Asus' own lineup of handhelds, including the ROG Ally and ROG Ally X. The included dock supports DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.0 ports with easy multi-device switching.</p><p>The glasses use USB-C to connect directly to mobile devices, including the Asus ROG Ally. The company says the experience is "plug-and-play" with "zero setup required" for the ROG Ally. The glasses include a spatial coprocessing X1 chip that is used to manage screen sizes, perceived distance, and more with a single button press.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="ZoAWvH4ZMihDs52go29iWK" name="temp4cj" alt="The Asus ROG and Xreal gaming glasses in a press render." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZoAWvH4ZMihDs52go29iWK.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Asus, Xreal)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The ROG Xreal R1 weighs only 91 grams for portability, and the electrochromatic lenses can tint situationally.</p><p>Bose is handling the audio here, with "precision-tuned spatial sound."

It's expected to ship globally in the first half of this year, but concrete pricing and available details are to-be-announced.

The Edge is driven by the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the rest of the S25 lineup (including the premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra</a>), plus you get 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage in a frame that measures just 5.8mm thick. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a> also boasts a flagship-quality 200MP main camera, a spacious 6.7-inch AMOLED display, and seven years of guaranteed OS and security upgrades. And again, the phone is ridiculously light, clocking in at just 163 grams. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-13" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what's the problem? Well, Samsung had to sacrifice battery size to make the Edge as thin as possible, so while most folks won't notice the difference with day-to-day use, the limitations of a 3,900mAh battery might have rubbed shoppers the wrong way. The Edge is also limited to 25W wired charging, which falls well behind the 45W charging support offered by the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra. </p><p>Samsung also fell into its own trap by releasing <em>quite a few</em> thin devices in 2025. It seems like most folks were happy to tack on another couple of millimeters if it meant that they could have a few more hours of battery life. Last but not least, with a starting price of over $1,000 for the 256GB phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge had a bit of a price problem. </p><p>Fortunately, bad news for Samsung spells good news for you, as the Galaxy S25 Edge has been repeatedly discounted for months at sites like Amazon and Best Buy. The phone is sure to get even cheaper when the spring sales roll around, but if you want an ultra-sleek smartphone today, this Amazon deal presents an awesome opportunity. </p> ]]></dc:content>

After launching the Pebble 2 Duo last year and announcing the Time 2 for this March, Repebble founder Eric Migicovsky announced the Pebble Round 2 this week, with plans to show off the watch at CES 2026.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://repebble.com/blog/pebble-round-2-the-most-stylish-pebble-ever">announcement post</a> and reveal video below provide details about this new device, which they began designing in March 2025 and will launch in May 2026, two months after the Time 2.</p><p>The Round 2 ditches the 2015 Round Time's <em>massive</em> bezel for a 1.3-inch, 260 x 260, 64-color e-paper touch display that's "optically bonded" to the glass for an increased viewing angle. It's about the same DPI as the 1.5-inch, square-shaped Pebble Time 2, though that uses fewer pixels (200x228).</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaDPMZKXcBU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Migicovsky says they could make the Pebble Round 2 "so easily with such a small team" because it uses the "same electrical circuit design as Pebble Time 2," while the hardware is "basically the same" as the 2015 Time Round.</p><p>Essentially, Repebble is recreating the classic experience with a few new perks, such as 10–14 days of battery life instead of just 2–3. The new model measures 8.1mm, slightly thicker than the 7.5mm Time Round — or about on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Garmin Venu X1</a> (7.9mm) — making it <em>much</em> skinnier than your typical <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a>.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5wnroXjWgJbYBrm2awRbqD" name="Pebble-Round-2-press-photo-4" alt="Photo of the Pebble Round 2 worn on a wrist surrounded by bracelets." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5wnroXjWgJbYBrm2awRbqD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Pebble)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2860px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="QMMnsc3YPUdGjy3UHTfT7D" name="Pebble-Round-2-colors" alt="Render of four Pebble Round 2 models, showing the three color options: matte black, brushed silver and polished rose gold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QMMnsc3YPUdGjy3UHTfT7D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2860" height="1609" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Pebble)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jXbwZHMfL5sLGrNLW8nBmD" name="Pebble-Round-2-press-photo-2" alt="Photo of the Pebble Round 2 sitting on a marble counter surrounded by props." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jXbwZHMfL5sLGrNLW8nBmD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Pebble)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One simple way Pebble pulled this skinny frame off is by removing certain common smartwatch features available in the Time 2: A HR sensor and a speaker for reading out notifications or AI replies. Pebbles aren't designed for workouts or Bluetooth calling, but the Time 2 can support a few extra features that the Round 2 can't.</p><p>Otherwise, both smartwatches use the same open-source Pebble OS, which works with both Android and iOS.

It won't have GPS tracking or NFC payments.</p><p>The Pebble Round 2 can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://repebble.com/watch">preordered now</a> for $199, and anyone who preordered a Time 2 can switch to the Round 2 if they prefer its design — and don't mind downgrading from 30 days of battery life to 14.
