<ul><li>Fitbit and Google are drawing attention to users about a battery overheating problem with the Sense and Versa 3.</li><li>Google has created a patch to fix the issues, which is rolling out for those who require it/are affected.</li><li>The company has also provided a form that users can fill out, which will determine their eligibility for $50 in compensation.</li><li>Fitbit was hit with two lawsuits in 2022, one for overheating with its Ionic watches and another (two months after) for the Sense and Versa.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly calling attention to a potentially dangerous situation regarding two of Fitbit's smartwatches.</p><p>Our friends at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/fitbit-issues-battery-overheating-warning-over-two-of-its-most-popular-watches-and-it-might-compensate-you-if-youre-affected">TechRadar</a> hopped on this after receiving word from Google about a battery overheating problem affecting the Fitbit Sense and Versa 3. The company reportedly adds that a "limited" number of those devices and users may be affected.</p><p>In detailing the situation, a Google statement says this issue "poses a potential risk for users and requires an immediate firmware update."</p><p>The publication highlights the details of the update provided by Google. According to the post, the update for the Fitbit Sense and Versa 3 will improve the "stability" of the batteries while also "reducing the risk" of overheating. Unfortunately, tackling this through software seems to adversely affect the longevity of the batteries in both watches.</p><p>Google states that, as a result of the update, "the battery will last for shorter periods between charges."</p><p>The post states that users with these devices who require the update will be notified on two fronts: in the Fitbit app <em>and </em>via email from Google.</p><p>Furthermore, Google has created a form for this harmful battery discovery for affected users. Those with a Fitbit Sense or Versa 3 can fill out the information <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/contact/fitbit_sense_and_versa_3_registration?visit_id=638731352243419808-3939466803&p=sense-versa3-help&rd=1">in this form</a> to "determine eligibility" for "an appeasement of $50 USD." If you require the update, it will be delivered, as well as the compensation money should your eligibility prove true.</p>

<p>Curiously, this isn't the first time Fitbit has had an issue with overheating batteries as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-is-recalling-over-1-million-ionic-smartwatches-heres-why">a similar problem</a> occurred with its old Ionic smartwatches. The company issued a recall of nearly one million of the watches due to the severe risk it posed to consumer safety. The company stated at the time that its batteries could overheat and (potentially) create a burn hazard when worn.</p><p>This led to a lawsuit, which was then shored up by <em>another </em>two months later in May 2022.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-hit-with-another-lawsuit">second lawsuit</a> claimed that Fitbit's trackers and watches were burning users' wrists due to overheating batteries. The devices detailed in this second lawsuit were the Fitbit Sense and the Versa — which is similar to what we're seeing crop up today. Users provided after images of the damage done to their skin because of the hotter-than-expected batteries against their body.</p><p>It seems like Google is trying to get well ahead of this issue, lest both sides suffer a repeat of 2022.</p>

For example, if you add a line with the Unlimited Ultimate plan and trade in pretty much any Android phone at Verizon, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus/"><strong>you&apos;ll get $1,000 in promo credits over 36 months</strong></a>, enough to make the super-balanced S25 Plus completely free. </p><p>And when I say nearly ANY <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, I mean it: devices dating all the way back to the original Galaxy S (2010) will you the full $1,000 of credit when you add a new line. No kidding. The only catch is that you&apos;re limited to trading in devices from Apple, Google, or Samsung (sorry, Motorola users). To sweeten the deal, Verizon will also throw in a free Galaxy Watch 7 or Galaxy Tab S9 FE, which means you could be getting over $1,500 of free stuff when you preorder. </p>

<p>Just like its predecessor, the Galaxy S25 Plus is all about balance.

<ul><li>Google has released Android 16 Beta 1 to developers and early adopters, meaning users can enroll their Pixels in its program.</li><li>The update packs support for a wide range of features like better large display support for apps, "live updates," and video recording updates.</li><li>Google reiterates that it plans to release Android 16 by Q2 2025, but it's also planning a minor SDK update for features and more in Q4.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's here to end your week on a good note as the latest installment of Android 16's beta is coming to developers and early adopters.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/first-beta-android16.html?m=1">announced</a> today (Jan 23) that Android 16 Beta 1 is available for all enrolled users and Pixels <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">in the program</a>. Google teases that this initial build of Android 16 is loaded with support for future features it aims to deliver — and help devs flesh out, too. To start, the post states Android 16 Beta 1 works to improve the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/01/orientation-and-resizability-changes-in-android-16.html">app adaptability</a>" users experience across devices.</p><p>Google says it has removed the restriction apps have when attempting to resize itself for a new orientation or display size. In short, this change will reportedly allow "large screen devices" to run apps in any size window and aspect ratio. However, Google states that this alleviation of restriction will not apply to games. Most other apps <em>should </em>now fill the screen more comfortably for larger screen devices, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">book-style foldables</a>.</p><p>Developers have been given the tools to rework their apps to fit this new protocol within Android 16 Beta 1. In 2025, Google states devices with a screen of 600dp (width) will see this change applied with apps targeting API at level 36. Next year, these changes will hit apps targeting API at level 37.</p><p>A major introduction in Android 16 Beta 1 is "Live Updates." If you caught Samsung's Galaxy S25 reveal, this might remind you of its lock screen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-lock-screen-keeps-you-in-the-loop-on-sports-and-directions">Now Bar</a>. According to Google, Live Updates will also find a home on your Pixel's lock screen in this test. Users can "monitor" ongoing activities "among other notifications."</p><p>In this initial test, Google states Live Updates are intended for more urgent notification cases.

<p>Android device cameras are receiving a new update in Beta 1 as Google highlights new support for Advanced Professional Video (APV). The company states this is designed to help users record videos at a higher quality. The post-production side is also reportedly sped up as Android 16 Beta 1 brings a quicker editing workflow, multi-view video, auxiliary video, and more.</p><p>The post highlights some neat things about APV, such as its ability for perceptually lossless video quality, which is stated to be close to "raw video quality." The lightweight entropy coding scheme is said to add support for a high bit-rate range for 2K, 4K, and 8K resolutions.</p><p>Elsewhere, this first beta brings updates to the Accessibility side of Android 16 by way of supplemental descriptions for drop-down menus. Moreover, Android 16 should better identify and navigate between fields that require information when using an accessibility service. The software's test will give developers a better look at its predictive back support for three-button navigation devices and its ART (Android Runtime) internal changes.</p><p>Google highlighted the recent introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-allows-users-to-share-images-files-youtube-videos-to-gemini-live">Samsung-specific Gemini extensions</a> for the Galaxy S25 series. While that included support for Samsung Calendar, Notes, Reminder, and Clock, Google states it will seek to work with other OEMs to do the same for them and their users and devices.</p>

<p>Users need to strap in because Android 16 is gearing up for a Q2 2025 release — which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-gemini-android-studio-sdk-updates">much earlier</a> than we're used to. Of course, Google has been running its Developer Preview since late last year, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-2-released">the second one</a> arriving in December. However, this timeline gives us a clean look at when we should expect Android 16's major release. Q2 gives us a timeframe between April and June.</p><p>More importantly, Google states that while the major release is in Q2, users should also expect minor SDK releases (for features and more) sometime in Q4 2025.</p><p>Also, with Samsung and Google so intertwined following the Galaxy S25 launch on January 22, the Korean OEM teased the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which could drop amid Android 16's launch.</p>

<ul><li>The OnePlus 13 is receiving another firmware update a week after the first arrived shortly after launch.</li><li>This second update improves the camera experience of the OnePlus 13 while also adding new AI translation features.</li><li>The first update integrated Google's Gemini Nano model with Google Messages on the OnePlus 13 for the Magic Compose experiment.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A little over a week later, OnePlus is pushing another update to its latest flagship series to fix several problems.</p><p>Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich spotted a new update on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> earlier today (Jan 23). The update arrives as version <strong>CPH2655_15.0.0.405 (EX01)</strong> with a download size of 330MB. The patch is small, but its changelog details quite a few fixes for several aspects of the device, beginning with its cameras. OnePlus states it has fixed the colors of photos when users are in Master mode.</p><p>This small patch also aids the stability of the OnePlus 13 cameras while also improving the "tone" of pictures when using the rear set in Photo mode. Additionally, users will find a fix for the phone's zoom.</p><p>When OnePlus revealed its major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-releases-android-15-based-oxygenos-15-heres-when-your-phone-will-get-the-update">OxygenOS 15</a> (Android 15) software in October, AI was a major part of it. The latest update for the OnePlus 13 includes new additions for its on-device AI, such as a "live translation feature that shows the translation of speech in real-time." Users can also listen to AI-based translations when wearing headphones, too.</p><p>Another newly added AI feature is a face-to-face translation feature that shows the translated speech of each speaker in a split view. Joining this is the ability for users to initiate a face-to-face translation session by tapping their headphones. OnePlus warns that this functionality will not work everywhere and is limited to "selected" headphones.</p><p>The Chinese OEM adds, "The translation of one language is played on the speaker on the phone, while the translation of the other language is played on the headphones."</p><p>The full patch notes are as follows:</p>

<p>OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1778649046873800709">also brought attention</a> to this update and stated that users in India, the E.U., and other global regions should see this new update. While we've noticed the update here in the U.S., users should begin checking their devices as the week finishes for it, too.</p><p>The company's latest flagship models — the OnePlus 13 and 13R — debuted on January 7 and we've already picked up <em>two </em>firmware updates. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-13-gets-gemini-nano-and-oneplus-13r-receives-new-updates">first update</a> arrived last week as the Chinese OEM fixed some issues alongside the addition of Gemini Nano. Google's AI model brought its generative AI power to Google Messages on the newest devices. The OnePlus 13 and 13R now benefit from the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-compose-google-messages">Magic Compose</a> button, an experimental feature that provides suggested replies in conversations.</p>

<p>Two new titles debuted with incredible physics-driven combat that's sure to wow you with every swing and punch. First up is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/clone-drone-in-the-hyperdome/4523126804481573/">Clone Drone in the Hyperdome</a>, a VR sequel to the popular Steam title Clone Drone in the Danger Zone. Hyperdome uses a similar voxel visual style, but there's much more to this visual style than meets the eye.</p><p>While you might get Minecraft vibes at first, the game is a lot more Teardown than Minecraft because of the ability to slice enemies in the most brutal ways, all using the fun power of voxels to dismantle them. Weapons all have a convincing weight and each type will need to be wielded very differently, otherwise you'll end up as a steaming heap of voxels yourself.</p><p>Clone Drone in the Hyperdome uses a roguelike structure where you'll embark on an infinite death loop, fighting through procedurally-generated levels until you eventually die yourself. As you progress, you'll unlock different powers and weapon types by defeating unique bosses, each with its own skillset that you'll have to choose from before embarking on your adventure.</p>
<h2 id="is-that-the-elden-ring-2">Is that the Elden Ring?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YqCBSDKrXaQsaTZpMJEMqF" name="grimlord-meta-quest-screenshot" alt="A screenshot of fighting knights with a sword in Grimlord on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YqCBSDKrXaQsaTZpMJEMqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Metalcat Studio)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the opposite side of the action spectrum is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/grimlord/6784503354964529/">Grimlord</a>, with its Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals and unforgiving Soulsborne gameplay. This one channels some of the best qualities of Dark Souls and Elden Ring into a stellar VR package, including that dark fantasy setting people love.</p><p>You'll traverse the hand-hewn world, unlocking shortcuts and watching around every corner for the next enemy ready to pummel you to pieces. The swordplay isn't just physics-driven, it's also incredibly accurate feeling and translates beautifully to dozens of other weapons you'll find throughout the game.</p><p>Grimlord was in early access for two years, honing its gameplay via community feedback and eventually switching over to Unreal Engine 5 for the final release. If the visceral combat and brutal, unforgiving nature of a Soulsborne title is your jam, go ahead and try the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/grimlord-free-demo/5015212428599892/">free Grimlord demo</a> a shot first. Based on reviews and my own experience, I'm quite confident you'll end up buying the full version in no time flat.</p>
<h2 id="trapped-in-the-rennaissance-2">Trapped in the Rennaissance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YoJdaTyUENWaXcFy4EHVy8" name="house-of-da-vinci-meta-quest-screenshot" alt="Solving puzzles with the ghost of Leonardo Da Vinci in House of Davinci on the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YoJdaTyUENWaXcFy4EHVy8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Blue Brain Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If puzzle games are more your style, the escape room-like vibe of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/the-house-of-da-vinci-vr/6074227932599910/">House of Da Vinci VR</a> is sure to give you a thrill. Cutting-edge graphics and phenomenal artwork really shine on the powerful chipset in the Quest 3 and Quest 3S, but more than that, the puzzles you'll find will make you feel smarter than Tom Hanks in "The Da Vinci Code."</p><p>Leonardo Da Vinci was known for his elaborate inventions and detailed drawings, all of which developer Blue Brain Games took inspiration from. Each machine you come across requires serious brain power and deductive reasoning to solve which, in turn, will give you access to the next area with more puzzles to solve.</p><p>Games like this work particularly well in VR because of the medium's tactile nature, giving you the ability to not only look around at each machine from every angle and inspect it up close but to hold intricate parts in your hand and understand spatial relationships required to solve them. It's a win-win for puzzle and adventure fans alike!</p>
<h2 id="turn-based-strategy-gets-a-mixed-reality-makeover-2">Turn based strategy gets a mixed reality makeover</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h8D7B2Uv9Mbxh5KaCHi2TR" name="augmented-empire-meta-quest-screenshot" alt="A mixed reality screenshot of turn-based strategy game Augmented Empire running on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h8D7B2Uv9Mbxh5KaCHi2TR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Coatsink)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/augmented-empire/7618080518206990/">Augmented Empire</a> is the complete rebuild of the classic VR turn-based-strategy title with updated graphics, mechanics, hand tracking, and even mixed reality support on the Quest 3 and Quest 3S. Sporting a neon-drenched cyberpunk theme and superb turn-based mechanics, Augmented Empire is made by the same folks who brought us the excellent Jurassic World Aftermath a few years back.</p><p>The game follows classic turn-based mechanics where each character has a dedicated set of attacks and limited moves they can make each turn. I particularly love it because not only is the gameplay very chill — being turn-based means you can take your sweet time if you want — but the new mixed reality elements make it feel like playing a board game that came to life right on your table or in the middle of your living room.</p><p>You can even choose to have the game board stretch across your entire room, making the small world feel alive and realistic. The story is rather good, and the price is even better at just $12.99. Nothing like a low price and a great game to make an even better weekend!</p>
<h2 id="more-to-come-2">More to come</h2>
<p>This was just a teeny tiny slice of what's available on the Meta Quest now and what has come out in the past two months alone. A ton of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> are on the way including heavy-hitters like Alien Rogue Incursion which we already know is an incredible game from the PC VR and PSVR 2 release in December.</p>

<ul><li>Google and Samsung have announced that they are creating their own open-source spatial audio format dubbed Eclipse Audio.</li><li>The aim of the new format is to bring the best spatial audio experiences to the masses as well as creators.</li><li>Users would soon be able to experience its upcoming Samsung TVs range, Android devices, soundbars, Google Chrome browsers, and YouTube videos.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Consumers’ audio listening experience has come a long way. Users are seeing a gradual shift from stereo sound experience to spatial audio. To complement the latter, Google and Samsung are creating their own open-source spatial audio format dubbed Eclipsa Audio.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/01/introducing-eclipsa-audio-immersive-audio-for-everyone.html">accompanying blog post</a>, Eclipsa Audio is based on the Immersive Audio model and Formats (IAMF). It is co-developed by Google, Samsung, and others that come under the Alliance of Open Media (AOM). The IAMF, which is already open-source, makes the creation of Eclipsa Audio files easier with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/iamf-tools">notable audio tools</a> and simultaneously supports a wide variety of workflows.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1042px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.58%;"><img id="CYR4pPKLK62fnPjtaJSkce" name="eclipsa-audio-format-workflows" alt="Eclipsa Audio format workflows" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CYR4pPKLK62fnPjtaJSkce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1042" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The aim of the new open-source format is to give the best spatial audio experiences for the masses as it can be experienced in your regular day-to-day use. Starting this year, creators can upload videos in the Eclipsa Audio format on YouTube.</p><p>Samsung, on the other hand, will be incorporating this technology in this year’s TV lineup. It includes the company’s Crystal UHD series next to the premium flagship Neo QLED 8K models — giving users a variety of options.</p><p>Google is also believed to be integrating native Eclipsa Audio playback support into the Google Chrome browser and will be working closely with TV and soundbar manufacturers later in the year to bring the new audio format support. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android devices</a> will also be getting Eclipsa Audio support through an upcoming Android AOSP release.</p>
<p>“Google and Samsung will be launching a certification and brand licensing program in 2025 to provide quality assurance to manufacturers and consumers for products that support Eclipsa Audio.”</p><p>Going further, later this spring, the companies are going to make a free Eclipsa Audio plugin for Avid Pro Tools Digital Audio Workstation to make the process of creating Eclipsa Audio files easier. After which, more average consumers might be able to experience the spatial audio experience across a wide range of devices and operating systems.</p>

<ul><li>Google to bring some HTC VIVE engineers on board to develop Android XR.</li><li>The search giant has already collaborated with Samsung and Qualcomm to bring reality headsets and glasses.</li><li>The company is now adding HTC’s expertise in the VR space by bringing in a strong technical team.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Last December, Google first introduced Android XR in partnership with Samsung and Qualcomm intending to bring Gemini-powered reality headsets and glasses.</p><p>Today (Jan 23), the search giant has announced (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/22/google-android-xr-htc-vive/">9to5Google</a>) that it is accelerating the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR platform</a> with a new agreement with HTC. It means the popular HTC VIVE engineering team, who are behind the VR space, will be joining hands with Google to create a headsets and glasses ecosystem under its Android XR platform, the company mentions in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/android-xr-htc-agreement/">announcement post</a>.</p>
<p>Google also acknowledges HTC’s “strong technical team with a proven track record in the VR space, ” and their collaboration in building the reality space, which the search giant is currently expediting after investing in XR for over a decade now.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vive.com/us/newsroom/2025-01-23/">HTC’s press release</a>, Google is paying the company a whopping $250 million to acquire certain members of the HTC XR team to join Google. This agreement is believed to “drive the growth” of the XR ecosystem altogether. “As part of the transaction, Google will receive a non-exclusive license for HTC’s XR intellectual property (IP),” the press note states.</p>

<p>Furthermore, HTC’s current commitment to delivering VIVE XR innovative solutions, including the VIVE Focus Vision, will remain unchanged. It means the existing product lines will be supported and developed without any interruption.</p><p>It isn’t the first time Google has acquired HTC employees for its in-house development of products. Back in 2017, Google and HTC announced a definitive agreement under which certain HTC mobile division employees were acquired to develop Pixel smartphones. HTC received $1.1 billion in cash as part of the agreement.</p><p>Regardless, the latest announcement comes after Samsung demonstrated its Android XR-powered mixed reality headset that comes under "Project Moohan” at Wednesday’s (Jan 22) Unpacked event, where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/icymi-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-biggest-announcements-and-reveals">company announced</a> the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a> series. The headset is believed to be available for the masses later this year, per the previous announcement.</p>

Obviously, there's still plenty of time before we can get anything like design renders, but with leaks around camera modules and battery tech surfacing, it's time to see what's in store for 2026. <br><br>Samsung is going to continue its usual release cadence, so the S26 series should make its debut sometime in Q1 2026. The latest information suggests Samsung is set to retain a trio of models — the Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra — but with the S25 Edge slated to launch later this year, we'll have to wait and see how that device does and if Samsung decides to launch the model alongside the other phones next year. With that out of the way, here's what we know about the Galaxy S26.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s26-we-may-finally-get-a-new-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy S26: We may finally get a new design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xETzw2tvXYbiYMQtZhF9SV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-backs-all-colors-05" alt="All four colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xETzw2tvXYbiYMQtZhF9SV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung didn't really change the design this year, and the S25 and S25+ are identical to their predecessors. That was always going to be the case considering how little the design changed with the S24 series itself, and we're basically in the third year of the same design. <br><br>If anything, it's the S25 Ultra is the only device that is noticeably different to last year's model. Samsung went with flatter sides and rounded edges this time, and the device is thinner and lighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">S24 Ultra</a>, a big deal in and of itself. What I like is that it is narrower than last year; this was a problem on the S24 Ultra, so I'm glad to see Samsung rectifying that this time. <br><br>With the S26 series, Samsung is said to be overhauling the design. We don't know what the design will look like, and it is unlikely that Samsung will radically alter the overall aesthetic — the minimal design with individual rings around the cameras is distinctive to Galaxy devices, and the brand wouldn't want to make too many alternations to that style. That said, I wouldn't mind seeing better colors and materials, and a little added design flair on the Ultra model.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-is-likely-to-get-a-200mp-telephoto-lens"><span>Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is likely to get a 200MP telephoto lens</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KqaJdPXEH9GVPTXc8CSRpT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro camera housing highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KqaJdPXEH9GVPTXc8CSRpT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> is the best camera you can buy today, and while it has a standout main camera, it's the 200MP telephoto that gives it a distinct advantage. The high-resolution lens takes outstanding portrait shots at 3x and detailed photos up to 30x, and it is one of my favorite things about the device. <br><br>Honor also used a 200MP telephoto lens in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>, but it isn't the same sensor as the X200 Pro. That said, it also takes terrific photos and portrait shots. It's clear that these massive imaging modules make a difference, and Honor has a nifty AI-assisted mode that cleans up photos, delivering clean shots at up to 100x. <br><br>Ironically, the camera sensors used on both of these phones are made by Samsung, and I don't really know why the brand doesn't use it on its phones instead. That could be changing in 2026, as a new leak suggests Samsung will include a 200MP telephoto lens on the S26 Ultra, giving the phone a considerable upgrade. <br><br>We'll have to wait and see if the phone uses the newer HP9 module (which is in the X200 Pro) or the HP3 that Honor went with, but it's good to see Samsung considering the module on its 2026 flagship.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-could-introduce-silicon-batteries-as-standard"><span>Samsung could introduce silicon batteries as standard</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wTCdYEecrNss5YoMsAnSr6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Galaxy-S25-back-holding-01" alt="Comparing the back of the Samsung Galaxy S25 with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wTCdYEecrNss5YoMsAnSr6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another area where Samsung didn't make any changes this year is battery tech, with the S25 series offering similar-sized batteries as their predecessors. With most Chinese phones now coming with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbide batteries</a> that have better durability and density, Samsung is on the backfoot. <br><br>That may change with the S26 series, as a recent leak out of Korea suggests Samsung is mulling a switch to silicon batteries next year. It could mean bigger batteries within the same chassis — just like the X200 Pro and other 2025 phones — and that's always a good thing. <br><br>I saw a leak that indicated Samsung will switch to 65W charging next year, and if anything, that sounds like a wishlist than credible information. While it would be great to see faster charging on Samsung's phones, the brand has been cautious in this regard, and I don't see that changing in 2026 — I'd love to be proven wrong though.</p>
<hr>
<p>We'll get many more details about the Galaxy S26 series over the coming months, and I'll regularly update this article as and when new leaks surface. With this year's models being iterative, there's increased attention on what Samsung is doing in 2026, and whether it will deliver meaningful upgrades.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android 15 QPR2 Beta 3 is here, offering a preview of the significant improvements and new features arriving with the upcoming March Feature Drop.</li><li>A key highlight is the resolution of an issue that caused unexpected device restarts during phone calls.</li><li>As always, the update focuses on improving overall system performance and stability through various bug fixes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> QPR2 Beta 3, marking a big step toward the upcoming Pixel Feature Drop set for March. This update takes on a bunch of nagging issues across Pixel devices.</p><p>The latest release includes the January 2025 security patches and has build number BP11.241210.004, as per a post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1i6t88s/android_15_qpr2_beta_3_now_available/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>. It’s meant to smooth things out with bug fixes and performance boosts.</p><p>Eligible users can now get a sneak peek at the upgrades heading to their devices with this beta.</p><p>The latest beta is ready for a whole bunch of Pixel phones, including the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series and everything back to the Pixel 6. So, if you've got a Pixel 6, 7, 8, or 9, and you're feeling adventurous, you can give this beta a whirl.</p><p>While this update fixes a bunch of bugs, the big news is it stops those annoying random restarts when you're on a call.</p><p>Here's a rundown of some of the major fixes in this update:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed issues that could cause a device to restart when making a phone call. (Issue #379051274, Issue #390594506)</li><li>Fixed an issue where trying to resume an app from the app overview would return to the home screen instead. (Issue #385017194)</li><li>Fixed issues where the language picker menu (accessed by long-pressing the spacebar) changed the window, which caused the IME to hide in apps that had set their softInputMode to STATE_ALWAYS_HIDDEN. (Issue #388201594, Issue #386972825)</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused a clicking sound in the background while recording video. (Issue #385998260)</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused wireless charging to stop functioning in some cases. (Issue #379301921)</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause devices to crash after starting an exercise on a connected Wear OS device.</li><li>Fixed an issue with null pointer exceptions that sometimes caused the system UI to crash.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the Android Beta Feedback app to crash sometimes when submitting a bug report.</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, connectivity, and interactivity.</li></ul>
<p>For those already in the beta program, the update should pop up in your settings. Just head to <em>Settings</em> > <em>System</em> > <em>Software updates</em> > <em>System update</em> to check it out.</p><p>QPRs are like mini-Android updates that happen every few months. Instead of waiting for a huge Android version like 16, Google uses QPRs to sneak in new features, fix bugs, and generally make your phone smoother.</p><p>If you want to leave the Android 15 beta program, you'll have a chance when the March Feature Drop rolls around.</p>

There's agentic AI, a feature akin to Google Now called Now Brief, and better integration with Gemini out of the box among many others Samsung highlighted, but what you don't get this year is much in the way of upgraded hardware.</p>

<p>This isn't new either; last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> wasn't markedly different to its predecessor, and I didn't use the device that much as a result. I was holding out for Samsung to make considerable changes with this generation, but that isn't the case, and the S25 Ultra misses out on innovations that are now standard on its rivals. <br><br>The key omission is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbide battery tech</a>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> all utilize silicon batteries to deliver better density, so you get much bigger batteries without any difference in size; the OnePlus 13 is actually thinner and lighter than the OnePlus 12 while offering a battery that's 500mAh larger than last year. <br><br>Silicon batteries also hold up better in extreme cold weather, and come with better durability. The ability to slot in a bigger battery with increased durability is a game-changer, and most other manufacturers are taking full advantage of the tech — Xiaomi even offers it on the mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-14-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 14 Pro+</a>. But the S25 Ultra misses out on the feature, with the device featuring the same 5000mAh battery as last year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hCjsYM4hmtGBLzAxgkiFEk" name="top-down-view-home-screen-all-four-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2" alt="Top-down view of Home Screen on four Galaxy S25 Ultra colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hCjsYM4hmtGBLzAxgkiFEk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the charging situation. The S25 Ultra still uses the same 45W standard, and we don't get any upgrades this time. I started using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/baseus-nomos-140w-charging-station-review">Qi2 chargers</a> recently, and I figured they might be a good alternative with Samsung's latest phones, but the S25 Ultra is just Qi2 ready, and doesn't have the magnets in the chassis itself — you'll need to buy a case to be able to use the feature. <br><br>Samsung switched out the wide-angle lens on the device, and there's now a 50MP module that should take better photos. But the main and telephoto cameras are unchanged, and I can't help but feel that Samsung will lose even more ground in this area against devices like the X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro. <br><br>Chinese manufacturers are doing incredible things with phone cameras, rolling out massive sensors and delivering generational upgrades on a consistent basis. The X200 Pro gets a 200MP telephoto camera that takes phenomenal portraits at 3x, and Samsung just doesn't have an answer to that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CgrpzhMTVHkxgMn22SckDK" name="samsung-galaxy-25-camera-lenses" alt="The new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra camera lenses at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CgrpzhMTVHkxgMn22SckDK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even the main camera on most Chinese phones is markedly better than what I used last year, and while the S25 Ultra should take better photos thanks to the changes to the ISP, I'm not sure it will dethrone Vivo, OPPO, and Honor anytime soon — I'll be putting that to the test once I get my hands on the device. <br><br>Similar to last year, most of the new features on the device center around AI. Every other phone manufacturer is getting on the AI bandwagon, and all phones I used in the last 18 months had some version of an AI utility. In each of these cases, I got the sense that the brands are shoehorning dubious AI features onto their devices just because it is the buzzword de jour. Samsung, however, is positioning Galaxy AI as the cornerstone of the S25 Ultra, and I'm not sure that's a winning strategy. <br><br>Don't get me wrong; I like the design changes Samsung introduced this year. The S25 Ultra has flatter sides with rounded edges, and it is thinner and lighter than its predecessor, which is good to see. Samsung also shrunk the bezels, accommodating a bigger 6.9-inch AMOLED panel without increasing the height. As a result, the S25 Ultra is easier to hold and use, and thanks to Gorilla Armor 2 protection at the front and back, it should have much better resistance against tumbles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bxdGWcyWrsjT4Ba4wqoujj" name="top-down-view-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-stacked-colors" alt="Top-down view of four different Galaxy S25 Ultra colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bxdGWcyWrsjT4Ba4wqoujj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the switch to Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite, the phone should be faster as well. Samsung once again worked closely with Qualcomm to customize the platform, and the overclocked chipset has decent gains over last year. But it wasn't like the S24 Ultra was short on power anyway, and whether you get any noticeable difference is something I'll need to wait and see until I get the phone. <br><br>Look, I'm not saying that the S25 Ultra is a bad phone — far from it. It's just disappointing that Samsung played it safe yet again, and the S25 Ultra isn't the best version of the phone it could make if it really wanted to do so. Samsung doesn't have any meaningful rivalry in North America, so it can get away without offering tangible upgrades to the camera or battery life. <br><br>While the OnePlus 13 is a much better showing this year, it doesn't have anywhere close to the same level of carrier backing as the S25 Ultra, making it a nonstarter in the region. Combine that with Samsung's generous trade-in incentives, and the S25 Ultra inevitably ends up being the default option if you want a high-end Android phone.</p>

<p>Up next is Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">Circle to Search</a>, which also gained a few new tricks thanks to an expansion of AI overviews. The company states this expansion will apply to "trending images," "unique objects," and more. Once highlighted,  Circle to Search displays quick facts, including links to what the user has searched for. For instance, if you look for a weird-looking dessert, Search will explain what it is and where it comes from.</p><p>Something else that's new with Gemini on the Galaxy S25 is the ability to interact with apps using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">Agentic AI</a>. Summon Gemini by holding the side button; the AI will then interact with the apps on your Samsung phone. You can also ask Gemini Live to review your photos, suggest any edits, and other such interactions.</p><p>The company reiterated that all the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features are available across the entire Galaxy S25 lineup, so even if you get the basic mode, you get it packed with all the AI features.</p>

<p>The next thing Samsung showed off today was more on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> and how it would utilize the Android platform for its upcoming mixed-reality headset. Samsung's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>" Android XR-powered headset is also on the show floor at Unpacked. However, folks attending the event were not allowed to try it on as yet. That said, this was the first time they've publicly shown off the headset like this, giving viewers a good idea of what's in store with this project.</p><p>We expect the headset to have motion controller support like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>, but for now, we aren't sure when this headset is likely to be released or whether it will come with the controller within the box.</p>

<p>While we thought we'd seen it all, Samsung threw us a curveball, and If you turned off the livestream to the Unpacked event too soon, you'd have missed a good, long look at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge.</p><p>Samsung teased a fourth addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">S25 series</a>— what we thought could be the Galaxy S25 Slim, now has a new name.</p><p>The device looks sleek, possibly with an end-to-end screen (going by its name) and a solid design. The video also showed us the components of the device as a part of the teaser, but not much else.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge appeared quite thin and lightweight. The S25 Edge seems to have two cameras at the back and likely a small selfie camera at the front. In terms of design, the phone, much like the S25 series, has rounded edges and extremely thin bezels.</p><p>We don't have the full specs yet, as Samsung revealed next to nothing about the phone, including how thin it actually is. It could carry the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">S25 series that launched today</a>, another key fact that has yet to be revealed. We also don't know when Samsung plans to release the phone; however, there has been some chatter that it could come out as soon as April or May of this year.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung and Google mentioned something we haven't heard yet when it comes to smartphones during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">Galaxy Unpacked 2025</a> presentation: Agentic AI.</p><p>You might have missed it because they didn't say anything more about it except to say the name, but they talked a lot about what it should be able to do inside the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25</a> phones. It plays a big part in all the newer, smarter Galaxy AI stuff.</p>
<p>Agentic AI is a new technology, but it's not brand-new cutting-edge stuff. It's been around for a minute and is currently running inside factories and manufacturing plants that use a lot of automation.</p><p>What it is sounds kind of boring: probabilistic tech that's adaptable to changing environments and events. But it's not boring! This means it's a mix of LLMs, machine learning, and automation (either software or hardware) that can create semi-autonomous AI, which will analyze data, set goals on the fly, and take the appropriate action to meet the goals it set for itself.</p><p>This sounds like a fresh step towards the scary humanization of AI, but we're not quite there. Yet. But it can create an AI agent that seems more like a person when you interact with it and can better serve your needs, within boundaries, of course.</p>

<p>Samsung mentioned that the new AI tools and features are available because of a new specialized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-expands-snapdragon-8-elite-lineup-with-new-7-core-variant">Snapdragon chip</a> with an ultra-powerful NPU (Neural Processing Unit). That's a big part of it all.</p><p>Another thing mentioned was a knowledge graph built on the things you do and where, when, and how you do them. Both are used to bring Agentic AI to life inside a tiny smartphone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="P83orc3XuyZYwGvByiZnAm" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-personal-data-engine-knowledge-graph" alt="Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P83orc3XuyZYwGvByiZnAm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Consider how Agentic AI works in a factory since it's already in place there. Someone lets the software know what they need, say 20,000 widgets ready and boxed for shipping in five days.</p><p>Workers program individual automation lines that perform the various jobs needed to build a widget. This is like the data you add to your own knowledge graph on your phone — you're telling the software the recipe <em>and</em> the ingredients for the end result.</p><p>Agentic AI oversees the whole operation. It knows how many widgets need to be finished and when they are needed, so it adjusts individual parameters to meet the goal in the most efficient way. If one line making a part is down for maintenance, it can ramp up the capability of another line that makes the same part until the maintenance is complete, for example. If the packaging line goes down, it can stop whatever needs to stop so it doesn't overwhelm it while it's being serviced.</p><p>These are all routine tasks, but the software was programmed to watch them, analyze the data it gets, and make informed decisions based on it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oWS5zUYGx3KDY3o38JfemX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-S25-Plus-and-S25-display-01" alt="Comparing the sizes and shapes of the displays on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, and Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oWS5zUYGx3KDY3o38JfemX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On your phone, Agentic AI has all the data from everything you do with your devices in one place. When you ask the AI for something, say a photo of a sunset at Nags Head on July 4, or how much you need to run every day to burn off a few more calories, it rifles through that data and analyzes what it finds.</p><p>It then decides what data is more useful, what data shouldn't be used at all, and which data is the most important to provide you with what you requested. If it sees 100 photos of Nags Head, 1,300 photos taken on July 4, and 71 photos of sunsets it cross-checks the data to see if any of it comes from the same photo. If it does, that's what it shows you. If it doesn't, it returns whatever it was programmed to respond with when there is no answer.</p><p>This works autonomously so you can get a notification telling you to leave for work 20 minutes early because there is an accident on your normal route and you need to go a different way. And bring an umbrella even though it looks sunny right now; it will rain later this afternoon. You can also get your coffee here because the Dunkin you normally stop at isn't on your new route.</p><p>It remains to be seen how well this new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> will work. On the surface, it really doesn't seem so different than the things our phones can already do for us or tell us. But the technology is a big step up, and a lot more will be possible once some bright engineer dreams of doing it.</p>

<p>Screen protectors can be tricky when purchasing. Depending on your phone's in-screen fingerprint reader and the thickness of the screen guard itself, you may or may not have a positive experience. That is why you should only invest in the best Samsung Galaxy S25 screen protectors.</p><p>The LK 2 Pack Samsung Galaxy S25 Screen Protector set proves that you don't need to spend a lot to get good quality protection for your S25's display. Many of the editors at Android Central have used this brand and always found it satisfactory. LK includes everything you could need for an at-home installation, which makes this an even better deal at $15.</p><p>Searching for big-name brands instead?

<p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra may have just been announced a few hours ago, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">our hands-on review</a> showcases a powerful device with a new look, upgraded hardware, and some of the most advanced AI features found on any smartphone to date. The phone boasts ridiculously-fast performance thanks to the customized Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, plus you get a stunning 6.9-inch AMOLED display, a lighter construction than its predecessor, and a guaranteed seven years of OS/security upgrades, straight out of the box. </p><p>Now, of course, not everything is perfect with the S25 Ultra. There&apos;s been no significant improvement to the Ultra&apos;s charging speeds, the price is still too high, and if you don&apos;t care about AI features, you&apos;d probably be better off going with a more-affordable Android flagship, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. But if you like to be on the cutting edge of smartphone technology and you can get a good deal, the Galaxy S25 Ultra might just be the premium device for you.</p>

<h2 id="it-s-a-tough-call-to-make-but-you-can-only-have-one-shade-of-the-s25-or-s25-plus-2">It's a tough call to make, but you can only have one shade of the S25 or S25 Plus</h2>
<p>There are three main color palettes to consider when choosing which Samsung Galaxy S25 color to buy. Both the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus come in B&W hues, blues and greens, as well as the warmer set of pinks and reds. Start your decision-making process by eliminating the group of colors that you don't like.</p><p>For example, you might find grayscale monochromes like Silver Shadow and Blueblack boring. Or perhaps those are the only colors that appeal to you. Listen to your gut. Once you've settled that, you can zero in on which shade of the S25 or S25 Plus calls to you the most.</p><p>Of course, you could feel completely overwhelmed and not know what to pick at all. If a recommendation is all you want, I highly suggest Coralred or Silver Shadow. These are the two most attractive colorways of the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus in my opinion. If you're worried about dirtying the light silvery option or muddying the brighter red hue, just get a very high-quality clear case with anti-yellowing properties. Any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">best Galaxy S25 cases</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-cases">Galaxy S25 Plus cases</a> will offer this.</p><p>Bear in mind that not all colors are available everywhere. If you opt for the vivacious Coralred for instance, you can only buy it online. Your choice might change depending on the mode of purchase, so be mindful of the online exclusive colors.</p>

<h2 id="let-s-get-down-to-business-and-decide-which-s25-ultra-shade-you-should-buy-2">Let's get down to business and decide which S25 Ultra shade you should buy</h2>
<p>Now that you've seen all the retail and online exclusive colors of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, you'll have a good idea of what stood out to you and what appalled you. If any single color didn't immediately catch your attention, I'm here to help.</p><p>Black is always the safest shade to buy when getting anything. Whether it's a phone or a car, a laptop or a washing machine, black never disappoints. If you don't like anything Samsung has to offer, just get the Titanium Black option. The great thing about this year's Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra colors is that there are two blacks, so if you don't like the titanium frame, you can always buy the online exclusive Titanium Jetblack.</p><p>Not shy of making a statement? Or perhaps you want to grab attention. If you're one of the brave and the bold, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a lovely sight in Titanium Silverblue. It's soothing to look at and the silver accents elevate the entire colorway.</p><p>This one's a personal favorite but I adore the Titanium Jadegreen shade as well. Green isn't for everyone, but this light olive tint is marvelous. It's the color I would buy. If you like plants and shrubbery like myself, you'll love it too!</p><p>If all else fails to please you, pick any of the black options, slap on a phone cover and call it a day. There are some really cool <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra cases</a> available that can easily revamp this boring metal-and-glass brick of a device.</p>

<ul><li>Netflix posted its Q4 2024 revenue report, which states the company had a quarter fit for the record books with a 16% YoY growth to $10.2 billion.</li><li>The key point of this report is Netflix's plans to increase prices in the U.S., Canada, and more, bringing a "popular" plan to $17.99 monthly.</li><li>Netflix's Q4 2023 was also a "record-breaking" quarter and the company was prepared to raise prices shortly after that, too.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Netflix is delivering its typical end-of-quarter overview, giving us a look at how 2024 ended and what the future holds.</p><p>Netflix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">recently published</a> its Q4 revenue report and highlights that this past quarter was one for the record books (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2025-01-21/netflix-posts-record-quarter-thanks-to-live-sports-squid-game">Bloomberg</a>). The company states that its revenue had grown by 16% YoY (year over year), assisted by "19M paid net adds." It adds that its operating income rose by 52% YoY and that it finished 2024 with 302M subscribers.</p><p>The Q4 report says its performance in the previous quarter "outperformed" expectations. However, the folks at Bloomberg notes one key statement during the earnings call: prices are set to rise.</p><p>Despite such a record-breaking qurater for Netflix, the company is reportedly preparing to increase the price of its "most popular U.S. plan" by $2.50. The publication states the price of this plan — which could be the Standard Plan — will jump to $17.99 per month.</p><p>This reported price increase is apparently slated for the U.S., Canada, Argentina, and Portugal.</p><p>Reports adds that the company is also looking to increase the price of the "cheaper ad-supported" plan, too.</p><p>In its Q4 file, Netflix states it has factored in this planned pricing increase in the aforementioned countries in its 2025 outlook. The company says it's looking to maintain "healthy growth" in the new year and projects anywhere between $43.5 and 44.5 billion in generated revenue. Netflix estimates that its operating margin will also rise to 29%. It states that these numbers are the result of "improved business fundamentals," its record-breaking Q4 2024 numbers, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.</p><p>Netflix is also interested in developing more live programming and games in 2025. The fight between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, as well as its Christmas Day NFL games were among the highlights. The report states that the football games streamed on Christmas were two of the "most streamed" games in NFL history.</p>

<p>Netflix has had a long history of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-raises-prices-basic-premium-plans">price hikes</a> for several of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-reportedly-prepares-another-price-increase">its subscriber plans</a> — and for a few different countries. So, it feels like we're just living in a time loop, by this point. Regardless, following Netflix's other "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-teases-price-hike-2024-plan">record quarter</a>" (Q4 2023), the company announced a price increase was inevitable for its users. The company increased the price of its Standard plan before, which brought it to $15.50, but that was because it phased out the old "Basic" plan.</p><p>Netflix also has the cheaper, ad-supported plan, which is seemingly where the company was to push people. At the time, Netflix said, "Scaling our ads business represents an opportunity to tap into significant new revenue and profit pools over the medium to longer term."</p><p>That report shed light on how much Netflix spent for its WWE Raw streaming program: $5 billion over a 10-year period, beginning in 2025. Even then, it felt like that money had to come from somewhere.</p><p>Since it looks like we're set for another definite price increase, all we're left with is the waiting room until it happens.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung teased a tri-folding phone at Galaxy Unpacked 2025.</li><li>During the event, the tri-fold graphic appeared as Samsung was talking about its ecosystem of Galaxy devices.</li><li>Rumors suggest Samsung has been working on a tri-fold phone, as prototypes have been shown off in the past.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Like many of you, I was watching along as Samsung introduced the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25</a> series. As if I weren't excited enough about all of the upcoming Galaxy AI and Gemini features on the way, Samsung showed off an outlined render of a tri-fold foldable phone.</p><p>The graphic that was shown, was essentially a timeline of various devices, with the Android XR headset found right in the middle. However, to the left of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a> outline, was both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ill-admit-it-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-better-than-i-imagined">Galaxy Z Fold</a> as we know it today and an outline of the tri-fold folding phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA" name="samsung-unpacked-android-xr-triple-fold" alt="Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has been rumored to be working on a tri-fold for some time now. Prototypes of such devices have been shown off at various trade shows, including CES 2025, where the Samsung Display booth actually had two concept devices on display. One of which can be folded in upon itself, and unfolds as if you were opening a book.</p><p>The other was a tri-fold folding phone that works similarly to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-reaction-is-a-tri-fold-phone-necessary">Huawei Mate XT</a> that was released in 2024. The different screens are layered on top of one another, offering the ability to use just two of the three panels at once, if you wanted to.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Hf5aoDyaQK5sonvTkf2Wib" name="huawei-mate-xt-tri-fold-screen-unfolded.jpeg" alt="The Huawei Mate XT tri-fold offers a 10-2.inch display experience." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hf5aoDyaQK5sonvTkf2Wib.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1406" height="791" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just earlier this week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-flagship-foldable-production-rumors">a rumor surfaced</a> suggesting that Samsung's tri-fold will "feature a 9.9 to 10-inch screen when unfolded." Unfortunately, that same report claims that "roughly 200,000 units" will be produced for consumers. It sure sounds like we're in store for another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">Galaxy Z Fold SE</a> situation, but hopefully, that won't be the case.</p><p>As for when the tri-fold could make its debut, expectations are that production will begin in Q2 2025, putting it sometime between April and June. What will be interesting to see is whether this tri-fold phone will at least be shown off alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Flip 7</a>. Those devices are expected to arrive sometime this summer, potentially as early as July.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1131px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-promo-render.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1131" height="636" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While slipping the tri-fold in there came as a surprise, Samsung just completely ignored it. At the time when the graphic was shown, the presentation was focused on Android XR, Project Moohan, and how AI will be integrated into the platform.</p><p>After feeling as though the Galaxy Z Fold series has become a bit stale, this could be the spark that Samsung needs to reinvigorate itself and the foldable form factor. Now it's just a matter of playing the "wait and see" game until some type of formal announcement is made.</p>

<ul><li>Meta detailed a new cross-posting feature arriving for WhatsApp via its addition to the Account Center.</li><li>Users can decide to post their WhatsApp Status to Instagram or Facebook Stories (or both) when linked to the Account Center.</li><li>Meta adds that users will retain their privacy and security through E2EE for messages and calls when linked.</li><li>Late last year, WhatsApp picked up better cross-platform support and a username option for new contacts.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta is detailing a new feature for its messaging service, WhatsApp, that better connects it with the rest of its ecosystem.</p><p>As highlighted in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/01/whatsapp-joins-accounts-center/">blog post</a>, Meta states it has started rolling out an Account Center option for WhatsApp accounts. Your WhatsApp profile is "off by default," meaning users will have the choice of adding it if they'd like. The major point of this addition is that users — once added to Account Center — can "reshare" updates from WhatsApp Status to their Instagram and Facebook Stories.</p><p>Meta states its delivering this cross-posting option in the menu when creating a WhatsApp Status. Users don't have to cross-post to <em>both </em>platforms if they don't want to. The sub-menu will feature small toggleable options for Instagram and Facebook for quick decisions when updating your Status.</p><p>To help alleviate our privacy concerns, Meta states that your calls and messages will remain end-to-end encrypted if added to the Account Center.</p><p>Additionally, WhatsApp's availability in Meta's Account Center is beginning to hit users globally. It will take some time to appear for everywhere, but once it does, users will find the option in the app's settings.</p>

<p>As the feature rolls out, Meta teased additional features that users can expect down the road, like AI Stickers and a centralized hub for your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-imagine-me-selfie-all-platforms">Imagine Me</a> products. Ther are also plans to manage all of your avatars without having to bounce between places in the app.</p><p>Meta's Imagine Me launched in mid-July last year, leveraging the company's generative AI software to turn you into something entirely different. Users can kickstart the AI by saying "Imagine me..." followed by whatever you'd like. You can turn yourself into a tennis player, an astronaut, or maybe a DJ. When messaging Meta AI, the announcement stated that users can type "change" to make any alterations they see fit.</p><p>In other news, WhatsApp picked up a huge update late last year, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-likely-to-have-userames-soon">brought in usernames</a>. The idea of a username is meant to replace phone numbers when saving new contacts. More importantly, the update also let users add and manage contacts through WhatsApp on the Web and the Windows platform in cojunction with their Android phone/tablet.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung just teased a fourth Galaxy S25 device at the end of its Unpacked event.</li><li>A short video showcasing the new Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge was showcased right before the event concluded.</li><li>From the looks of it, the device looks sleek, light weight and has two main cameras at the back and also a selfie camera.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While we were hoping to see the new Samsung XR Glasses or another ring-sized surprise, Samsung did us one better! If you turned off the livestream to the Unpacked event too soon, you'd likely have missed what Samsung had in store for us at the very end.</p><p>At the tail end of its Unpacked event, Samsung teased a fourth addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">S25 series</a>—the Galaxy S25 Edge. What we thought could be the Galaxy S25 Slim, now has a new name.</p><p>We got a good, long, look at the device that looks sleek, possibly with an end-to-end screen (going by its name) and a solid processing system. The video also showed us the components of the device as a part of the teaser.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9fo8EsBntiCcnYkLJPARyh" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-parts-teaser" alt="Components for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge on stage at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9fo8EsBntiCcnYkLJPARyh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Central's Michael Hicks ,who is on the ground at the event, got a good look at the phone. The Galaxy S25 Edge, which is showcased in a silver/grey colorway, seems to be hung by a thin metal stand of sorts connected by a clip, possibly hinting at how light weight this phone could be. The S25 Edge seems to have two cameras at the back and likely a small selfie camera at the front. In terms of design, the phone, much like the S25 series has rounded edges and extremely thin bezels.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a premium Android device, you may think that brands like Samsung and Google are the only options in town. But they aren’t. When you compare the Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13R, you might actually be surprised at how close they are to one another. There’s a compelling reason to look beyond what’s most familiar to you. Here, I’ll compare these two phones so you can make an informed decision versus just going with what you already know.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rMMGxv3UpVvjtTL2TcQNvf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-display-morning-brief-holding-01" alt="Morning Brief on the Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rMMGxv3UpVvjtTL2TcQNvf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 is the latest entry-level phone in the brand’s line. Available in Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow. It has a 6.2-inch FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate.</p><p>With a screen made of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2, the frame is constructed or Armor Aluminum, so the phone is durable. It’s also IP68 rated to protect it against dust and water.</p><p>Equipped with a 4,000mAh battery, it supports Super Fast Charging, Fast Wireless Charging 2.0, and Wireless PowerShare.</p><p>The phone comes with either 128GB or 256GB storage. Since this is not expandable, you’ll want to choose the larger option, which costs a bit more. And if you tend to download a lot of apps and games and shoot lots of photo and video, you’ll probably have to factor cloud storage into the cost, or offload content to a separate drive when it gets full.</p><p>Out of the box with Android 15 and Samsung One UI 7, the phone is supported for seven OS upgrades and seven years of security updates. You get an ultrasonic fingerprint reader and face recognition for security.</p>

<p>One of two new phones OnePlus just launched, the OnePlus 13R is the more affordable, scaled down variant, similarly to how the Samsung Galaxy S25 is the entry option in its new line. The phone, which Harish Jonnalagadda calls “the definitive value flagship of 2025” in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">his review</a>, comes in Nebula Noir or Astral Trail with a large 6.78-inch Aqua Touch 2.0 display. This refers to the ability to comfortably use the screen even if your hands are wet from things like drops of rain or snowflakes. This phone also has a feature called Glove Mode that allows you to manipulate the screen while wearing thin gloves.</p><p>The screen supports a 1-120Hz dynamic refresh and offers 2,780 x 1,264 pixels with 1,600 nits brightness and 4,500 nits peak brightness. Jonnalagadda isn’t a fan of the boxier design, finding that the sides dig into his palm. But he likes the clean, camera housing and the sturdier feel when compared to last year’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>.</p><p>Speaking of which, the phone only has an IP65 rating, which isn’t quite as high as the Samsung Galaxy S25, but still protects it against some dust and water exposure. The screen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass GG7i.</p><p>OnePlus phones are known to have incredible battery life and the OnePlus 13R is no exception. It has a massive 6,000mAh battery that supports 55W SUPERVOOC charging, up to 80W with a OnePlus SUPERVOOC dual-port GaN power adapter or up to 100W with a OnePlus dual-port power adapter. Bottom line: not only does this phone last for days, you can plug it in and recharge it to full in the same time it takes you to grab a Starbucks coffee. Jonnalagadda says he got about two days per charge, a day and-a-half with heavy use, but he found that it took longer to charge than the OnePlus 13.</p><p>You’ll only get 256GB storage, a bummer given how much this phone can do so. So, consider a cloud storage platform or a means to offload images and other content. Otherwise, you may have to keep your downloads tight to just the most important apps, games, and other content you need.</p><p>The phone comes loaded with Android 15 alongside OnePlus’ own OxygenOS 15 OS for a smart, intuitive, snappy experience. You’ll get an optical fingerprint sensor, though Jonnalagadda isn’t a fan of its positioning low on the screen, along with face unlock NFC, and Bluetooth 5.4.</p><p>OnePlus supports the phone for four years of Android updates and six years of security updates, through 2031. This isn’t quite as long as with the Samsung Galaxy S25. But considering the much lower starting price, you might be OK with that.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-oneplus-13r-features-and-functions-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13R: Features and functions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PqTEpFWqVMxFeKFNJjbfvF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-back-mint-holding-01" alt="The back of the Mint Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PqTEpFWqVMxFeKFNJjbfvF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 comes loaded with the new Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, impressive as this is the same you’ll find in the top-line <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> model as well as the larger Galaxy S25+ variant. This processor is smoother, faster, and better able to accommodate all the new AI features of the phone, including on-device processing so you don’t have to rely on cloud connectivity.</p><p>With 12GB RAM, stand out features include not only Android 15 but also Samsung’s One UI 7. This affords lots of Galaxy AI features, like cross-app action with AI Agent: long-press the power button and Gemini instantly opens app with native app integration, regardless of what you’re doing at the moment and what app you’re in. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">his hands-on</a>, Nicholas Sutrich loved trying out this feature and found that it worked well: he was even able to search for specific recipes he wanted in an hour-long YouTube video.</p><p>There are also features like the Now Brief that shows you sleep, weather, and schedule data thanks to AI-powered insights. Multimodal Search can be used to search in various ways, including even humming a song to get help identifying it by name and artist.</p><p>Circle to Search has been enhanced, now able to recognize phone numbers and e-mail addresses to automatically call someone or open a messaging window, as well as URLs to open a web page. The phone also boasts better natural language understanding and can better understand context of requests.</p><p>This phone has an improved cooling system, something multitaskers, content creators, and especially gamers will appreciate. Overall, Sutrich says you’ll notice huge speed boosts with this phone, especially when compared to older models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Samsung Galaxy S23</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GPTJNJJdmJjbQrreigg8Yo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GPTJNJJdmJjbQrreigg8Yo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R has its share of AI features as well, thanks to Android 15, Google and Gemini integration, and its own OxygenOS 15 AI functions. These include features like intelligent search for blazing through files, notes, and photos quickly and efficiently, AI Notes, and more. “The interface is fast and doesn’t have any slowdowns or bugs,” says Jonnalagadda, who calls it “refreshing to be able to say that about a new version of the OxygenOS.” He loves the customizability options as well, and the various lock screen styling options.</p><p>Running on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, the OnePlus 13R might not be as snappy as the Samsung Galaxy S25 based on specs alone, but the phone will more than suffice for most users. Jonnalagadda did not encounter any gaming challenges at all while playing various titles. Combined with the 12GB RAM, you get an impressive user experience for everything from content creation to multitasking, video watching, and gaming.</p><p>Gamers will love the PUBG Mobile gaming experience that leverages the 120 frames-per-second gameplay capabilities. The phone also has plenty of AI features like Circle to Search, just as the Samsung Galaxy S25 does.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-oneplus-13r-the-camera-experience-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13R: The camera experience</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="42zoFP7EDYb3bxqECmZK7U" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-camera-viewfinder-01" alt="The camera viewfinder on a Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42zoFP7EDYb3bxqECmZK7U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What about the cameras? The Samsung Galaxy S25 has a 50MP wide AF OIS main camera along with a 12MP ultra-wide camera, 10MP 3x tele AI OIS camera, 30x Space Zoom, and 12MP wide AF front camera.</p><p>You can enjoy features like the ProVisual Engine, HDR Portraits, Selfie AI ISP, Nightography, and more. There’s also the typical photo editing features you were able to enjoy with the Samsung Galaxy S24 along with new ones like improved Audio Eraser for removing background noises and isolating sounds in videos. This feature, Sutrich notes, works on-device, and is super-fast and effective. Auto Trim even lets you remove certain words (think “ums” and “ahs”) or use AI to intelligently remove sound bites that aren’t necessary.</p><p>We’ll need more time to play around with the cameras in the Samsung Galaxy S25 to provide more feedback on their pluses and minuses.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qEK3Wim66oAJaiGzVToLXo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qEK3Wim66oAJaiGzVToLXo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the OnePlus 13R, it has a similar 50MP wide main camera, 8MP ultra-wide, 50MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom, and 16MP front camera. Most notably, it uses a Sony LYT-700 imaging sensor for the main camera, and the results show. You get stunning images of all kinds, including great motion, detail when zooming, and more.</p><p>There are unique photo editing features, too, that let you do things like remove distracting options (something you can do in the Samsung Galaxy S25 as well), unblur photos (also in the Galaxy S25), and even remove or reduce reflections in images.</p><p>Jonnalagadda found that images he took with the OnePlus 13R were just as good as ones with the OnePlus 13 suggesting that you aren’t downgrading any camera-related functions if you opt for this more affordable option versus its more premium sister device. He did admit, however, that you don’t get the same level of vibrancy and details with photos when using the wide-angle lens. He also noticed some visible noise when snapping photos in low-light scenarios.</p>

<p>It’s decision time! Years ago, we might have had a tough time recommending anything as one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> beyond Samsung Galaxy devices, along with a few other notable brands. But the Android space has been heating up of late, and some of those brands you might not be as familiar with are delivering incredible devices. That’s precisely why we’re making the comparison between the Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13R.</p><p>And we can confidently say that you might actually be better off with the OnePlus 13R. Not only is it significantly cheaper, it’s also a premium phone with cameras that match or even exceed the Galaxy S25. It has incredible battery life, a bright and bold screen, and a fast processor that can keep up with most anything you throw at it.</p><p>If you wanted to step up, even going with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> could be a better option since it sells for about the same price. What’s odd is that as you move up the line to the Samsung Galaxy S25+ and even Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, there’s still no truly compelling reason to get one of those phones instead of OnePlus’ latest entry. Considering the OnePlus 13 is bafflingly durable with both an IP68 and IP69 rating, it’s worth it for that price alone. But it’s also a darned good phone.</p><p>Back to the core two devices at hand: if you’re looking for affordable premium and deciding between the Samsung Galaxy S25 and OnePlus 13R, I’d actually suggest forking out a bit more and going with the OnePlus 13. You’ll still be paying the same you would for the Samsung Galaxy S25 and getting a more durable phone with a much bigger battery, Sony cameras, and a similar set of AI features, including some amazing photo editing ones.</p>

Sure, these phones are materially better than last year's and offer more features and better hardware, but are they $800 or more better? For some people, that answer is definitively a <strong>no</strong>.</p><p>If you're coming from an older Samsung Galaxy device — that largely means a Galaxy S22 or older — upgrading to a Galaxy S25 makes a lot of sense. It's a huge upgrade from previous generations and adds a ton of new features older hardware simply cannot support. Upgrading to a Galaxy S25 from a Galaxy S24 doesn't make as much sense, though.</p>

<p>If you're using a Samsung Galaxy S24 right now, there are almost no reasons to upgrade to the Galaxy S25. Let's break it down by model.</p><p>Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24 owners considering upgrading to a Galaxy S25 of the same model will see a bump in performance for everything they do. The Galaxy S24 isn't exactly a slow phone and won't feel "old" any time soon, but the new processor in the Galaxy S25 is 30-40% faster depending on what you do.</p><p>Other than that, don't expect to see much that's different. Most Galaxy S24 models already have 12GB of RAM — only a few smaller Galaxy S24 models shipped with 8GB of RAM — and while the Galaxy S25 has a bunch of nifty new AI features, they'll almost certainly make their way to the Galaxy S24 series when the One UI 7 update is released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">in a few weeks</a>.</p><p>Samsung didn't change the battery size, make the charging faster, or swap out the cameras for something new or different, so most of your daily experience won't be different between these two generations of Galaxy phones.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra sees the biggest year-over-year changes, but they might not appeal to everyone.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Galaxy S24 Ultra owners will see a few more changes when moving to a Galaxy S25 Ultra, but you might not like most of them. Samsung has ditched the curved sides in favor of completely flat side rails, while it chose round corners instead of square ones. That gives the Galaxy S25 Ultra a completely different look and feel compared to the Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>In addition to that, the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen no longer supports Air Commands or Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity. That means the Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn't allow you to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-first-things-to-do#section-taking-photos-with-your-s-pen-s24-ultra">S Pen as a remote camera shutter</a>, among other things.</p><p>You will get a boost in performance thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor inside the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Additionally, rumor has it that Samsung may have fixed some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultra-needs-to-fix-four-major-s24-ultra-display-problems">Galaxy S24 Ultra display complaints</a>. We haven't confirmed this yet but will do so as soon as we have review units.</p><p>Samsung also upgraded the ultrawide angle camera on the back of the Galaxy S25 Ultra to a 50MP sensor from a 12MP sensor on the Galaxy S24 Ultra. That will result in better quality ultrawide photos as well as much higher quality macro shots since the same camera captures both types of photos.</p><p>Samsung also added several new camera features like Galaxy LOG and Nightography Video which probably won't come to the Galaxy S24 Ultra. We'll have to wait and see what's in the final One UI 7 update but Samsung hasn't confirmed these features yet.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 series sports a 30-40% performance boost over the Galaxy S24, making the Galaxy S25 series the fastest mobile phones on the market. Last year's Galaxy S24 delivered a roughly 30% performance improvement over the Galaxy S23, while the Galaxy S23 was about a 40% performance boost over the Galaxy S22.</p><p>All that to say, if you're coming from a Galaxy S22 or older, a Galaxy S25 of any size is going to feel like a near-revolutionary improvement in speed and overall performance.</p><p>In addition, most Galaxy S21, S22, and S23 phones offered 8GB of RAM while the Galaxy S25 family packs 50% more. Anyone who multitasks regularly will see a huge difference in performance, and this additional RAM enables a host of cutting-edge new AI features that you're sure to love.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Brighter, bolder displays and stronger construction mean these will last a long time.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The displays have all seen big upticks in brightness, clarity, and several other features that can also be seen as improvements. Samsung doubled the PWM rate of its phones last year, making these phones more eye-friendly than your older Galaxy phone in some ways. They're still not as good as most other Android brands these days, so if you're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">sensitive to PWM dimming</a> you'll want to look elsewhere like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>Samsung's build quality has improved even more since the Galaxy S23 and older, with phones sporting more robust metal frames and glass that's stronger and more scratch-resistant than ever. The Galaxy S25 Ultra packs a titanium frame, which is both more scratch-resistant and stronger, all while reducing the weight over aluminum.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 family features completely flat front and back glass which makes finding a screen protector easier in some cases, although you'll want to follow our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-screen-protectors">best Galaxy S25 screen protector</a> guide to ensure you find one that works with the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor under the glass.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Galaxy S25's One UI 7 isn't just packed with features, it also comes with a seven-year software update promise.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 family launches with Android 15 and One UI 7 which sports a different look and feel compared to previous versions of Samsung's operating system. New features like a vertical app drawer and expanded quick toggles UI make One UI better than ever. Even that terrible old multitasking UI design has been given a fresh coat of paint, so it's easier and faster than ever to switch between running apps.</p><p>The Galaxy S25's new processor and expanded RAM enable great new AI features like AI Select, Now Brief, and AI Agents. Unlike some of the niche Galaxy AI features from last year, many of these new features are ones you'll actually find yourself using from day to day.</p><p>Now Brief will give you a Morning Brief and an Evening Brief, which includes daily information summaries and hidden features that you might not have known about. It's easily accessible via the Now Bar, which appears on the bottom of your home screen and in the status bar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="TnSftznBShisVRkjYUY3S5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-display-lock-screen-01" alt="Customizing the lock screen in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnSftznBShisVRkjYUY3S5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AI Select gives the old Smart Select tool a significant upgrade by giving you smart, context-sensitive actions when you circle something on your screen. That includes easy text extraction from images, generative edit suggestions, creating GIFs from videos, and lots more.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>New AI features take the frustration out of common tasks by giving you smart, context-sensitive actions by just circling things on the screen.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>AI Agents can be found by pressing and holding the power button which will now display a new Gemini UI in addition to context-sensitive buttons. When you're watching a YouTube video, for instance, a button will appear to summarize the video for quick reference. That can be nice when you <em>just want the dang recipe</em> and don't feel like sitting through all the "like and subcribe" fluff that some videos have.</p><p>Camera and battery life improvements over the years have added up to a really big deal. While the physical battery size may not be much different from your old phone, newer, more efficient processors and better software mean battery life should be better on the Galaxy S25 than your old Galaxy phone.</p><p>And the cameras are also guaranteed to be better than whatever older Galaxy phone you're coming from thanks to notable improvements in sensors, lens quality, and new processors with AI power that understand what's being captured and can enhance it in new and important ways.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung guarantees seven years of software updates with every Galaxy S25. That means you won't have to consider upgrading again for a very long time, all while getting great new features and important security updates round the clock. All in all, the Galaxy S25 is a huge upgrade for owners of older Galaxy phones and one we can heartily recommend.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, along with its sister phones the Galaxy S25+ and Galaxy S25 Ultra, will all come loaded with the latest version of Android, which is Android 15. They will also include Samsung One UI 7, the latest version of Samsung’s UI overlay, which adds tons of features, mainly relating to AI.</p><p>The phone can understand context and personal preferences to deliver customized AI experiences. Through a shared vision with Google, there are features like multimodal capabilities for interpreting text, speech, images, and videos. You can engage in more natural interactions using natural language to call up things on the phone.</p><p>You’ll get features like Google’s Circle to Search that can now also recognize phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and web URLs for one click access to what you want. There are also actionable searches with context-aware suggestions provided for the next steps.</p><p>Easily switch among apps, interact more naturally with the device, and press and hold the side button at any time to call up the Gemini AI assistant. It works with Samsung and Google apps along with a selection of third-party ones, too, like Spotify.</p><p>All these AI features, along with ones like Call Transcript, Writing Assist, Drawing Assist, and more, are thanks to the Android OS, Google integration, and Samsung One UI 7.</p><p>As Google releases new versions of Android, you will be able to download the latest ones for the next seven, up to Android 22 or whatever name is given to the next batches of updates should Android release a new OS annually. Most importantly, you will be able to enjoy a secure experience with the phone for the next seven years, all the way through to 2032. That’s almost unheard of when considering the phones of yesteryear, but it’s a commitment Samsung has made for its latest devices.</p><p>While chances are you’ll want to upgrade your phone much sooner than seven years from now, the extended support means you can confidently hand the phone to a friend or family member when you do, and they can be reassured that it will not only work but be current for many more years to come. Think of giving the phone to a child or teen as their first device, or a parent or grandparent.</p><p>This also means the phone, poised to take the place of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> on the list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a>, will hold its resale value. If you decide to sell it second-hand, you will get a good dollar amount for it with still many years of software upgrades and security support left.</p>

<h2 id="everything-you-should-know-about-samsung-galaxy-s25-battery-life-and-charging-2">Everything you should know about Samsung Galaxy S25 battery life and charging</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> includes three different models: the base Galaxy S25, the bigger Galaxy S25 Plus, and the premium Galaxy S25 Ultra. While the latter two models are rated for the same charging speeds, the regular Galaxy S25 charges slower, and this may be attributed to its smaller 4,000mAh battery.</p><p>The base Samsung Galaxy S25 is rated for "Super Fast Charging," "Fast Wireless Charging 2.0," and "Wireless PowerShare." Marketing terms aside, this simply means the Galaxy S25 can charge at up to 25W wired or 15W wirelessly. The phone also supports 4.5W reverse wireless charging for powering up other devices, like wireless earbuds.</p>

<p>By comparison, the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra support "Super Fast Charging 2.0," "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-fast-wireless-charging-20">Fast Wireless Charging 2.0</a>," and "Wireless PowerShare." This simply means that these Galaxy S25 models can charge at up to 45W wired or 15W wirelessly. Additionally, it can reverse wireless charge other devices at up to 4.5W. In other words, the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra charge 20W faster than the base Galaxy S25 when using a cable.</p><p>As previously mentioned, the higher battery capacities of the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra could be a reason they can charge faster. The former has a 4,900mAh battery, while the latter has a 5,000mAh battery.</p><p>All three Samsung Galaxy S25 models can charge wirelessly with Qi or Qi2 chargers, but the Galaxy S25 series does not have official Qi2 support. It won't work with magnetic chargers and accessories as a result. Unfortunately, that limitation is still common among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones in 2025</a>.</p>

You can charge the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra at up to 15W speeds wirelessly.</p><p>The Qi2 specification supports up to 15W fast charging wirelessly and magnetic connection with chargers and accessories. As such, Qi2 chargers will work with the Galaxy S25 series, even if the phones aren't officially certified and magnetic connection won't be possible.

<p>Samsung just unveiled its new S25 series at Galaxy Unpacked today, and we got a full look at the lineup in all its glory. To start, the series comes as a trio once again, with the top-end S25 Ultra, the middle child S25 Plus, and the standard S25 device.</p><p>When it comes to the core, all three devices are powered by a custom version of Qualcomm's customized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, giving these devices a performance boost (40% in NPU, 37% in CPU, and 30% in GPU) said to fuel the latest AI features within these phones.</p><p>“Galaxy S25 series opens the door to an AI-integrated OS that fundamentally shifts how we use technology and how we live our lives,” said TM Roh, president and head of mobile experience business at Samsung.</p><p>Additionally, the trio will run One UI 7 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review" target="_blank">Android 15</a>,  which the company says makes the Galaxy S25 "a true AI companion" that will interpret multimodal information in a seamless, interactive manner. Out of the box, Samsung promises seven generations of OS upgrades and seven years of security updates.</p>

<p>AI is really what's driving the new S25 series, with features including the Now Bar on the home screen, which highlights the user's personalized recommendations for entertainment, directions to their next meeting, or even help with communicating in different languages. And Now Brief can provide users with a snapshot of their day.</p><p>Next, Samsung will get upgrades to Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href=" https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">Circle to Search</a> that will not only interpret images and videos but will also recognize phone numbers, email, and URLs on your screen, letting you call, email, or visit a website with a single tap.</p><p>Images will also get a face life with ProScaler, an AI image processing on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and S25 Plus to achieve better image quality to match the QHD+ display resolutions.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> is focusing on bringing more intuitive interactions with the user, and Samsung says it will make tasks seamless. One can find a specific photo in Gallery or adjust the size of display fonts in Settings, by just pressing the side button to activate the upgraded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini</a>.</p><p>Lastly, the devices also get a new audio Eraser tool that simplifies the removal of disturbing or unnecessary ambient noise in recordings.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> gets a durable titanium build with smooth, rounded edges, unlike its predecessors' squarish ones. It has a 6.9-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED  display with a 120 Hz refresh rate protected by the new Corning Gorilla Armor 2, which helps with the phone's drop protection and anti-glare issues.</p><p>The device comes with a 5,000 mAh battery, like its predecessor, and is said to reach 65% charge within 30 minutes of charging with a 45W Adapter. The phone is compatible with wireless Qi2 chargers, but Samsung tells us it isn't optimized for Qi2. This means you can charge the S25 Ultra on another Qi2 device.</p>

<p>Getting into the camera array, the Ultra showcases wider black camera rims and comes with a new 50MP ultrawide camera sensor— upgraded from the previous 12MP, along with a 200 MP wide camera, another 50 MP Telephoto lens with a 5x zoom, and a 10 MP camera with a 3x zoom. On the front, the device comes with the same 12MP Front Camera .</p><p>The Ultra sticks to its IP68 dust and water resistance, making the phone water-resistant to a maximum depth of 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes.</p><p>The phone will be available in four colorways: Titanium silver blue, Titanium Whitesilver, Titanium Gray, and Titanium Black. However, people who order via Samsung.com get access to three unique colors, including Titanium Pinkgold, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Jadegreen. Samsung is retaining the price of its new phones this year with the Galaxy S25 Ultra starting at at $1,299.99, the same as the S24 Ultra and comes with three storage options 1TB  , 512GB and 256GB respectively.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus</a> get a fairly similar design to their predecessors with more rounded edges, sporting a  Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a 120Hz refresh rate similar to their predecessors. The S25 Plus has a sleek 6.7-inch QHD screen, while the standard model has a 6.2-inch FHD display.</p><p>The batteries remain unchanged, as the Plus model gets a 4,900mAh battery while the standard phone gets a 4,000mAh battery. Like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, they are both compatible with Qi2 charging but don't have built-in MagSafe charging, nor are they optimized for Qi2. For wired charging, they can reach up to 50% charge in around 30 mins with a 25W Adapter.</p><p>Samsung says that the external components of Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus have at least one recycled material and its metal frame incorporates recycled armor aluminum as well.</p>

<p>Both devices get a major upgrade with a new 50MP wide camera, a 12MP ultra-wide camera, and a  10MP Telephoto Camera  that comes with 3x optical zoom.  Samsung retains the selfie camera at 12MP for both devices.</p><p>The Samsung S25 and S25 Plus will also come with the same durability as the Ultra, sporting IP68 dust and water resistance, skipping out on the more robust <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a> we've seen on other flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus starts at $999.99 with 256GB and 512GB storage options, while the Galaxy S25 starts at $799.99 with 128GB and 256GB options. Both get four new colorways: Navy, Icyblue, Mint, and Silver Shadow colors, plus exclusive colors like Blueblack, Coralred, and Pinkgold when ordered directly from Samsung.com</p>

<p>The best Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus cases take assorted forms and are available at all kinds of price points. Such a thin and tall device might slip out from your hand easily, so watch out for ones that offer additional grip.</p><p>Dbrand is the king of cool skins and cases. Skins aren't very protective, though, which is why I recommend grabbing the Dbrand Grip Case (MagSafe) for the Galaxy S25 Plus instead. This case looks as cutting edge as the skins from Dbrand but adds more than just scratch-proofing. You also get textured sides for enhanced grip, military-grade drop protection, tactile buttons with great tactile feedback, and MagSafe support. It might be a pricey option, but Dbrand always delivers.</p><p>Now, if you're on a budget but refuse to compromise quality, there are tons of name brands that have performed consistently well over the years. For the Galaxy S25 Plus, both Poetic and Spigen's cases are budget-friendly but you still get added functionality and robust drop protection.</p><p>The Poetic Guardian MagPro case costs almost exactly the same as the Spigen Ultra Hybrid S MagFit case, with the latter saving you a dollar to your name. Of the two, Poetic's bumper cover offers better impact absorption and you also get frontal protection, something Spigen's case lacks. However, the Spigen Ultra Hybrid S MagFit is much slimmer. At the end of the day, it boils down to your preferences and style when choosing between the two. Rest assured that both are excellent choices, regardless of what you pick.</p>

<p>Samsung didn't alter the dimensions and shaping of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-hands-on-galaxy-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a> lineup dramatically. Even the camera lenses and flashlights of all three models align with the Galaxy S24 series, leading one to assume that all S24 cases fit the S25 lineup. However, this isn't universally applicable across the board.</p><p>Let's take a look at the dimensions of each model in the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Samsung Galaxy S24 series and compare the size differences first.</p>

<p>As you can see, the smallest Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S25 are nearly identical in size. Both phones boast 6.2-inch displays too. These minimal changes mean that you can easily reuse most of the Galaxy S24's phone cases on your latest Samsung device.</p><p>Next, we have the mid-sized Plus models to compare and contrast. Once again, the measurements mirror each other. I put both phones as well as cases from CASETiFY and Wave Case for both devices next to each other and they seemed identical in bulk and stature.</p><p>Noticeably, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra has the most changed proportions. The numbers might seem like a lot on paper, but I've held both the S24 Ultra and the S25 Ultra in hand. Let me tell you right now, the newer model is slightly thinner and taller than its predecessor. However, it's still possible to use most of the more flexible S24 Ultra cases with the latest S Pen-bearing Ultra model from Samsung.</p><p>Be warned, however. More solid S24 phone cases with hardshell exteriors and more rugged builds might not fit the S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra as well as they would fit the S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra. On the other hand, soft cases like the ones that I tested have more bend to them and are more pliable, so they can accommodate minor changes in dimensions.</p><p>A poor fit reduces the drop protection a case offers, so keep that in mind when going <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">case shopping for your S25</a>, S25 Plus, or S25 Ultra.</p>

<p>Even when narrowed down, you have so many options when it comes to the best Samsung Galaxy S25 cases. Your list of options is insanely wide, helped by the fact that many of the last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-cases">Galaxy S24 cases</a> fit the latest Samsung Galaxy model.</p><p>Depending on whether you prioritize style over function, the best S25 case for you varies. However, a universal best overall selection would be the Spigen Parallax MagFit for the Galaxy S25. This evergreen series never goes stale, adding both flair and drop protection to your device. After Spigen acquired the Parallax series from Caseology, the brand added MagFit to enable magnetism. This means you can easily use any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">best Qi2 and MagSafe accessories for Android</a> with your S25 with this case on.</p><p>If you want a full-fledged Qi2-certified case though, Spigen's Ultra Hybrid MagFit is more suitable. Both cases cost under $20, so you'll be happy either way.</p><p>With so many superb options to consider, an alternative best choice is so hard to narrow down.

<p>Despite the slight size differences, the Galaxy S25 Ultra can actually wear select <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-galaxy-s24-ultra-cases">S24 Ultra cases</a>. However, I don't recommend this because the fit won't be perfect, which will affect factors such as impact absorption and drop-proofing. So, choose one of the best Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra cases that were meant to be used with the device.</p><p>Which phone cover is perfect for your S25 Ultra? That's a very tough question, mainly because the answer is subjective. However, a few simple factors appeal to every kind of user. Drop-proofing, thinness, MagSafe support, and a few colorways are the main factors anyone buying a case prioritizes. Based on this, Mous has the best overall case for your Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. The British brand's Clarity 3.0 MagSafe Case for Galaxy S25 Ultra has scored sides for additional grip, adds impact absorption to your device, and comes with a magnetic ring for Qi2/MagSafe support.</p><p>The Mous Clarity 3.0 MagSafe Case might be too expensive for some users, which is why I love the i-Blason Cosmo case. It costs less than $30, comes with military-grade drop-proofing as well, and includes a screen protector so you don't have to spend money on one separately. There's a MagSafe ring embedded in the back and the S25 Ultra case comes in both clear, semi-transparent, and opaque designs. How versatile is that?</p>

<ul><li>Samsung confirms the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra shipping with Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chips worldwide.</li><li>Samsung and Qualcomm collaborate to make a customized Snapdragon 8 Elite chip that can handle Galaxy AI and Gemini assistant features better on Galaxy S25 phones.</li><li>It brings in the latest connectivity features alongside improvements to display and energy efficiency.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s new year has just begun as it launches the Galaxy S25 series today globally. They bring some exclusive features that set them apart from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there, and the most notable one happens to be the SoC — the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy.</p><p>Samsung confirms all Galaxy S25 models across all regions come with the “Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy” SoC. The approach is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, which came with "Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy" across all regions. While the other two siblings came with an Exynos processor in some regions. It doesn’t appear to be the case this time as all models across all regions equip the already proven powerful processor — in fact, a tad bit advanced version of it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gTpPF9D6RCHJrW8Zwegqc3" name="snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy" alt="Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTpPF9D6RCHJrW8Zwegqc3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung notes that the new Snapdragon 8 Elite happens to be the fastest mobile SoC, which is based on Geekbench 6.2 MT, Geekbench 6.2 ST, Speedometer, and Antutu CPU.</p><p>Qualcomm and Samsung seem to have worked together for the SoC to “deliver premium image quality and power consumption on a Galaxy smartphone display.” With the new chip, the Galaxy S25 users can also expect better low-light video capture capabilities even in 8K, next to making the devices power-efficient as well.</p><p>The companies’ collaboration also means the chipset is utilized for all the latest Gemini experiences alongside managing tasks between apps, live-streaming from the Gemini app, and utilizing Gemini as a writing assistant — all these experiences are promised to run seamlessly on the Galaxy S25 series. Samsung also notes that the SoC is customized to deliver better Galaxy AI, mobile gaming, and connectivity as well.</p>

<p>It supports 5G by utilizing the Snapdragon X80 5G Modem-RF System next to Qualcomm’s FastConnect 7800 mobile connectivity system for faster cellular and Wi-Fi 7 speeds. The Galaxy S25 series also marks the first commercial phone to incorporate Snapdragon Satellite, which allows users to send and receive messages via satellite (narrowband NTN).</p><p>"The collaboration between Qualcomm Technologies and Samsung has always been about pushing the boundaries of what's possible. With the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, we are not just enhancing performance; we are redefining the user experience by integrating cutting-edge on-device AI and connectivity features that will shape the future of mobile technology,” said O.H. Kwon, senior vice president and president, Qualcomm APAC.</p><p>All in all, the new chipset on paper showcases some notable benefits over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> that powered notable premium handsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. The exclusivity for Samsung should likely make the Galaxy S25 series already ahead of the competition.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung has just wrapped up its Galaxy Unpacked event and announced its new Galaxy S25 series. Google, on the other hand, took the stage to introduce some cool new enhancements coming to Gemini to make it more helpful, personalized, and accessible on the Galaxy S25 series and other Android devices.</p><p>Gemini Live AI Assistant already helps users brainstorm new ideas, organize their thoughts, and also simplify complex topics in a conversational manner. And, the search giant now wants to make it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/new-gemini-app-updates-android">more versatile</a> and is adding the ability to add images, files, and YouTube videos to the conversation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="edAYDXFpZwVyp4WjubT32S" name="Gemini-Live-images-files-feature" alt="Gemini Live images and files sharing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edAYDXFpZwVyp4WjubT32S.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, a dog photo captured on a phone is shared on Gemini Live and asked about the shot composition, to which the assistant addresses that the focal point of the particular photo appears clear.</p><p>The latest support for adding images, files, and YouTube videos to Gemini Live will be rolling out to the latest Galaxy S25 series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series, starting today (Jan 22).</p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are also promised to be getting in the coming weeks. Additionally, Google notes that its Project Astra capabilities like screen sharing and video streaming Gemini on Android devices, including the latest Galaxy S25 models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="yjxunucs2eR426n9R8EmvR" name="Gemini-extensions-2025" alt="New Gemini Extensions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yjxunucs2eR426n9R8EmvR.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Further, extensions are a great way to get your tasks done with the help of Gemini — on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">favorite Android apps</a> like Gmail, Google Maps, Spotify, and several others. As part of the collaboration, some Samsung apps on the Galaxy S25 series, including Samsung Calendar, Notes, Reminder, and Clock, now work with Gemini in getting things done.</p><p>Similarly, Gemini can use multiple extensions in a single prompt. With the new inclusion, Gemini responses can now be saved to Samsung Notes or Google Keep. These multi-extension prompts are available to all Gemini users on the web, Android, and iOS devices.</p><p>Lastly, accessing Gemini is pretty familiar on the Galaxy S25 series too, which means long-pressing the side button will trigger the AI assistant.</p>

<p>Samsung today unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Galaxy S25</a> series, and it’s bringing something fresh to the table: the Now Bar. This new feature turns your lock screen into a handy hub for all the updates you actually care about.</p><p>Back in December, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">gave us a sneak peek at the Now Bar</a>, showing it off as a go-to hub for everything from managing entertainment and tracking fitness to real-time navigation and easy multilingual chats.</p><p>The Now Bar seems like a win for sports fans, keeping you in the loop with key match updates from your favorite teams, all right on your lock screen.</p><p>"With a single glance at your phone, you'll know when a match is on and be able to follow live with scores and more," Google said in a blog post. "If you want to dive deeper, simply tap the card to get perspectives, stats and news on Google Search."</p>

Samsung has officially announced its trio of flagship phones that it hopes will lead the industry in 2025. At the top of the list for many enthusiasts is the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which shares a few similarities with its predecessor, but is actually quite different.</p><p>I was able to spend a bit of time and got some hands-on with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. If there's one thing Samsung is great at, it's packing a ton of information into a short amount of time, kind of like packing a bunch of features into a brand-new flagship device.</p><p>So, without further adieu, let's dive in, and I'll share my first impressions of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. And if you want to get a better idea of what the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus have to offer, check out Android Central Senior Editor Nick Sutrich's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-hands-on-galaxy-s25-plus-hands-on">hands-on impressions</a>.</p>

<p>Coming as a bit of a surprise the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra starts at $1,299.99, which is the exact same price as its predecessor. There are three storage configurations to choose from: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB. At the same time, all models utilize the Snapdragon 8 Elite paired with 12GB of RAM.</p><p>In terms of color choices, Samsung actually offers a total of seven different options. The Titanium Black, Gray, SilverBlue, and WhiteSilver, will be available at your various retailers and carrier locations. However, if you order directly from Samsung.com, you'll be able to get Titanium Pinkgold, JetBlack, or Jadegreen.</p><p>Pre-orders for the Galaxy S25 Ultra are now available, with the phone slated to be released soon thereafter.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hardware-and-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Hardware and Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hCjsYM4hmtGBLzAxgkiFEk" name="top-down-view-home-screen-all-four-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2" alt="Top-down view of Home Screen on four Galaxy S25 Ultra colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hCjsYM4hmtGBLzAxgkiFEk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seeing as I daily carry an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-max">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, I'm no stranger to big and heavy phones. However, maybe someone was playing some Jedi mind tricks on me, but I immediately noticed how light the Galaxy S25 Ultra felt. It's the same kind of feeling that I had when I switched from the iPhone 14 Pro Max to the 15 Pro Max, as that was when Apple began using Titanium.</p><p>To be fair, I haven't used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-one-year-later">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> in at least six months, so I'm not exactly sure if this revelation will ring true for everyone. But even just going from putting the 16 Pro Max in my pocket to picking up the S25 Ultra, it was definitely noticeable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cqMbmpT2mZuc5QyRTKJxsj" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-close-up-corners-edges" alt="Close-up on Galaxy S25 Ultra corners and edges" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cqMbmpT2mZuc5QyRTKJxsj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something that wasn't so impactful was Samsung's decision to flatten the edges of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. To me, it was almost like I put down the 16 Pro Max only to pick it right back up. If you're tired of the yearly trope about the Galaxy S Ultra being the same as the iPhone Pro Max, it's only going to get worse.</p><p>In the brief time I had with the S25 Ultra, I didn't really come away with any distinct negative opinions about the hardware. It was comfortable to use, and ultimately, I feel like this is about as good as it gets when it comes to slab phones.</p><p>I will say that there were two colors that stood out from the rest. The first was the Galaxy S25 Plus in Navy, which you can check out in Nick's hands-on. Since my focus was on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, I was completely infatuated with the Titanium Black.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WQMgzY9XMhSjSogrPFS7Bk" name="iphone-16-pro-max-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-pixel-9-pro-samsung-galaxy-s25" alt="Back comparison of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, iPhone 16 Pro Max, Pixel 9 Pro, and Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQMgzY9XMhSjSogrPFS7Bk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of using the same color across the back glass and frame, Samsung switched things up a bit. On the back is the matte black color that you'd expect, but the frame comes with a more natural titanium look. It's striking, to say the least, and while the S25 Ultra doesn't have "punchy" colors, this does spice things up a bit.</p><p>I've made it this far without talking about the screen, but that's for a good reason. It's as bright and vibrant as ever, just as you'd expect from Samsung's latest flagship. Not to mention that changing up the design allowed for thinner bezels on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. As a result, the screen size is 0.1 inches larger than the S24 Ultra without actually making the phone any bigger.</p>

<p>I might've spoken too soon in calling 2024 "the year of AI." If anything, I should've known that this year would be even more AI-driven, and boy, oh boy, is Samsung bringing the heat.</p><p>This isn't exactly the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-potential-bixby-upgrade-unpacked-teaser">overhauled Bixby</a> experience that we had heard rumors about. Instead, most of what's new is made possible through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and the Gemini Nano co-processor. It all starts with a long press of the Side button.</p><p>Samsung made the surprising choice of making Gemini the default assistant on the Galaxy S25 after spending years trying to get people to use Bixby. To be clear, Bixby hasn't gone anywhere, but you won't need to immediately jump into Settings just to switch to Gemini.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="esQjsLPHXvRfKmB5amLHxX" name="ai-select-icons-sidebar-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="AI Select in sidebar on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/esQjsLPHXvRfKmB5amLHxX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I guess my original statement should be amended—2024 might've been the year of AI, but it looks like 2025 could be the year of "personalized AI." I'm actually excited to spend more time with the various features that Samsung is incorporating into its flagship lineup.</p><p>There are quite a few changes with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25</a> series and One UI 7, with almost all of them being focused on AI. As I try and sit here deciding which to talk about, it's impossible to choose. So before diving deep, here's a brief recap of what's new:</p>
<ul><li>Circle to Search now provides "enhanced recognition" while now being able to listen to audio playing from your phone.</li><li>You can use a more conversational tone and natural language when using Voice Search on the S25. This includes being able to ask it to change various settings, but you <em>will</em> have to actually provide the final input (i.e., toggling dark mode, turning off Wi-Fi, etc.).</li><li>Smart Select has now been replaced by AI Select in the slide-over menu. It performs all of the same tasks but now offers "actionable suggestions," in addition to being able to analyze sound and videos playing on your device.</li></ul>
<h2 id="cross-app-actions-are-ai-powered-automations-2">Cross App Actions are AI-powered automations</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GV8uVztNQ6vUQJYfr3QEWY" name="google-gemini-vegan-restaurants-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-1" alt="Ask Gemini to find vegan restaurants and send text on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GV8uVztNQ6vUQJYfr3QEWY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During its presentation, Samsung told us that the majority of users give up on performing a task if it takes more than three or four taps. So, in an effort to make your life easier, the Galaxy S25 series provides an "Integrated AI Platform" by way of "Cross App Actions."</p><p>Essentially, it's using the power of Gemini and AI to automate and perform tasks for you. In one example, Gemini was asked to look up the next football game, put it in the calendar, and then text that information to a friend. Gemini did everything correctly on the first attempt but stopped short of actually sending the text message.</p><p>I was curious as to why it couldn't just actually send the text for me, but the reasoning actually makes a lot of sense. Stopping and showing a preview of the message gives you the opportunity to make any changes before providing the final confirmation.</p>

<p>Another example of this in action was when watching a YouTube video about holiday dinner recipes. With the video playing, Gemini was activated, and it was asked to summarize the main dishes from the video.</p><p>Then, Gemini was asked to provide a list of ingredients, send that list to the Samsung Notes app, and then give instructions on how to make one of the meals. Meanwhile, all of this was done in less than a minute and without needing to actually play through the entirety of the 20-minute video.</p><p>What makes this really exciting is that you're not forced to set up and use Samsung's suite of apps. At launch, Cross App Actions will work across both Samsung and Google apps. There is a catch, as only Spotify and WhatsApp will be the first two third-party apps to be compatible with this feature. Samsung is hopeful that more developers will jump on board, but to be honest, I'm not holding my breath.</p>

<p>Another vital and exciting inclusion with the Galaxy S25 Ultra and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> is Now Brief. This is essentially a dashboard that provides an AI summary of your day, along with any important events, reminders, and other personalized information.</p><p>After you set up the Galaxy S25 Ultra, the Now Brief widget will greet you on the Home Screen. Tapping this will take you to the dashboard, where you'll be able to view the various bits of information. It seems that Now Brief will be updated at least twice a day, as you're presented with a Morning Brief and Evening Brief.</p>

<p>With the former, you'll be able to see the forecast, how you slept, scheduled reminders, and even suggestions for routines. Then, as you're winding down from the day, the Evening Brief tells you what you did throughout the day, includes any pictures that you took, and lets you know whether you met your activity goals. And if not, it will provide some recommendations on things you should try.</p><p>In terms of the health component, I suspect this will be gate-kept and locked to only Samsung devices. It's not all that surprising, but if Now Brief is as good as it sounds and you don't already have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung wearable</a>, this very well could be what pushes you to upgrade.</p><p>Tied hand-in-hand with Now Brief is the Now Bar, which is quickly accessible at the bottom of your lock screen. With this, we have one-tap access to notifications and our most used apps, again being done in an effort to cut down on the number of taps it takes you to do something before giving up.</p>

<p>To me, it just felt like Samsung's version of the Dynamic Island, but simpler. Instead of throwing it at the top of the screen, the Now Bar is at the bottom of the lock screen, making it much easier to interact with.</p><p>The problem is that there aren't very many apps that can actually take advantage of this addition. We don't have a full list of apps, but chances are that the Now Bar might fall flat if it's relegated to being either a timer indicator or another way to skip to the next song.</p>
<h2 id="build-your-own-llm-2">Build your own LLM</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zCVJp9Qa4Txbm29ioVhfhY" name="galaxy-ai-process-data-toggle-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Process Data toggle for Galaxy AI on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zCVJp9Qa4Txbm29ioVhfhY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you hear about Google Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT, these AI tools are built using LLMs. These models are trained on tremendous amounts of data in order to perform the tasks they can and answer the questions they try to. But what if you could build your own LLM right on your phone?</p><p>That's what Samsung is hoping to achieve with the Galaxy S25 series but without the concerns of this data being used by third parties. Samsung went so far as to create a partitioned portion of the chipset that will be used to store the necessary data and lock it behind Knox.</p><p>From what we were able to tell, the LLM is built by analyzing how and when you use your phone. But it also leverages your wearables in order to determine routines before then providing automated routine suggestions. Then, you should be able to just tap the prompt to create the routine without much fumbling around.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It feels like we're getting closer to a world where we can have our phones do anything else without prompt. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>An example provided was in reference to how 42% of Americans use a TV to fall asleep. With your Galaxy S25 and compatible smartwatch, the LLM will learn your nightly routine. So then, it will create a routine that will count down from 10, turn the volume down, and turn the screen off after it's recognized that you're asleep.</p><p>There are a lot of unknowns about how this will work. We don't even know if we'll be able to access the LLM on its own, inputting data and/or information to make it even more personalized and customized.</p><p>As an aside, although Samsung didn't provide specifics, we were told that between Gemini, the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and One UI 7.0, more AI tasks could be handled on-device. Once we actually get these phones for full testing, we'll be trying to figure out everything that can be done locally versus what needs to be handled in the cloud.</p>
<h2 id="the-s-pen-gets-nerfed-2">The S Pen gets nerfed</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="b8ZSDsj9F33yTNYfT3dppj" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-with-s-pen-angled-view-2" alt="Angled view of all four Galaxy S25 Ultra colors with S Pens unsheathed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8ZSDsj9F33yTNYfT3dppj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There were some concerns that Samsung would be doing away with the S Pen, but thankfully, that didn't happen. It's still alive and (mostly) well while being found slotted into the bottom left corner of the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>I say "mostly" because there is one rather surprising change being made — the included S Pen no longer features BLE technology. So, with this, you'll no longer be able to use Air Actions or the S Pen as a remote shutter.</p><p>Samsung did give a bit more insight, as we were told that less than 1% of Ultra owners were even using Air Actions. Of that less than 1%, the most commonly used feature was using the S Pen as a remote shutter. The company also stated that those who use an Ultra but don't have a Watch or Ring rely on the palm gesture to take a picture.</p><p>Kudos to Samsung here, but they also offered an explanation as to why this decision was made. Apparently, removing Bluetooth Low Energy and the battery improves durability. But it was also done to cut down a bit on the weight, which makes a tiny bit more sense.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-performance-and-specs"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Performance and specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="t747NLdaQXU6SunQpSiznj" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-home-screen-in-hand-1" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra Home Screen in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t747NLdaQXU6SunQpSiznj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the bigger reasons for getting excited about the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the reliance on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for Galaxy. But this time around, there's a little bit more going on here, specifically with the "for Galaxy" piece of the puzzle.</p><p>In previous years, Samsung has released devices with the Snapdragon "For Galaxy" chips. But these have pretty much only been overclocked versions of the base SoC with no other modifications. That's not the case with the Galaxy S25 series, as Samsung explained that it worked with Qualcomm to create a custom version of the processor.</p><p>In doing so, we were told that this new configuration provides "direct communication lines with various enhancements" that are specific to the Galaxy S25 hardware. Frankly, this is the way that it always should've been, but at least it's here now.</p>

<p>As a result, Samsung explained that we'll see increased performance across the board. This equates to a 40% increase in NPU performance, 37% in CPU performance, and 30% better GPU performance, when compared to the Galaxy S24. Seeing how popular mobile gaming has become, Samsung also claims a 40% increase in ray-tracing performance and 18% better Vulkan performance over last year's models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="46UHHatjXep5JgAVYnLqx7" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-01" alt="A Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite placard at a press event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/46UHHatjXep5JgAVYnLqx7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is the reason for much of this, Samsung also made some massive changes to the internal cooling system. As part of the redesigned chassis, this allowed Samsung to introduce a vapor chamber that is 40% larger on the Galaxy S25 Ultra than its predecessor.</p><p>The larger vapor chamber paired with the new "Thermal Interface Material," or TiM will hopefully ensure that days of thermal throttling are in the past. This "TiM" sits on top of the processor itself, pulling heat away from the chip and pushing it into the vapor chamber. Basically, it seems that Samsung is just implementing a custom heat sink, and we just have to hope it's actually more efficient.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cameras"><span>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2UCPremnLZccKfD2KyFbAY" name="angled-view-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-colors-2" alt="Angled view of all four Galaxy S25 Ultra options from Back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2UCPremnLZccKfD2KyFbAY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a reason why you're only just now getting to the camera portion of my Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on. Well, there are a few, but it's mainly because we weren't really able to actually test out the cameras. Rest assured, I'll be pitting the Galaxy S25 Ultra against the iPhone 16 Pro Max and other phones to see how it stacks up.</p><p>That being said, Samsung did show off a few of the new features and improvements. While the main and dual telescopic lenses remain the same, the Galaxy S25 Ultra introduces a new 50MP ultrawide sensor. As you'd suspect, it relies on pixel binning, resulting in a 12MP image that provides 4x more detail over the S24 Ultra.</p><p>Easily the most exciting addition to the arsenal of camera options is Audio Eraser. Again, we weren't able to try this ourselves, but we were shown a demo of how it works, and the results were pretty incredible.</p>

<p>In the demo, a previously downloaded video of a man talking into a camera in the mountains was played. While you can hear his voice, it's rather difficult to hear due to the wind and other outside elements. But with the tap of a button, Audio Eraser springs into action, isolating just the man's voice and cutting out all of the other sounds. It's not too unlike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Magic Audio Eraser</a> on a Google Pixel.</p><p>What makes this particularly exciting is that you can actually customize the EQ levels for six different audio aspects. Being able to have this kind of flexibility is fantastic, especially considering it can be used with <em>any</em> video, and not just those recorded using the Galaxy S25.</p><p>Speaking of video recording, Samsung is also introducing the ability to record LOG (logarithmic) video. This is very common with professional videographers, as it captures more detail without "blowing out" bright areas or oversaturating others. It does so by recording video using a "flat" color profile, giving you a level playing field if you want to manually color correct.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="V9rfK5kuitaT8e2AHQWSrj" name="log-button-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="LOG toggle in the Camera app on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V9rfK5kuitaT8e2AHQWSrj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hope is that for those comfortable with recording and editing LOG videos, you'll end up with videos that are more "true to life." Plus, Samsung includes three LUTs, or "Look-Up Tables," that can be applied directly from the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>These are just a few of the new features, but they were mostly relegated to bullet points on a slide. But we're still excited to put the Galaxy S25 Ultra through its paces, and hopefully, all of this AI will fix a few of the complaints we've had in the past.</p>

<p>For as much as I would love to sit here and give you a definitive answer to whether you should buy the Galaxy S25 Ultra or not, I simply can't. I haven't spent enough time with the phone to come to any type of conclusion.</p><p>What I will say is that from my time with the S25 Ultra, it might be able to do enough for me to switch my main SIM card over from the iPhone. Again, that's not definite, but if Samsung managed to follow through on its claims and promises, it might be time for a rather drastic change for me.</p><p>If you're looking to upgrade from something like the Galaxy S23 Ultra or another flagship from 2023, I'd say go ahead and at least get your order in. At the very least, you won't have to worry about missing out on any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">pre-order deals from Samsung</a>.</p><p>At the same time, if you already have the Galaxy S24 Ultra, you probably don't need to upgrade immediately. That being said, Samsung is offering up to $1,250 off when trading in your "old" phone, and that's tough to ignore.</p>

The Samsung Galaxy S25 lineup pushes the envelope for more AI features than ever, but this time around, Samsung has been careful to engineer all three phones around delivering quality, actionable information without going to the cloud first.</p><p>Samsung calls this new model a new, more personalized Galaxy AI and even says its new phones build a local LLM customized just for you and how you use your phone. As if that wasn't already great, Samsung improved the amount of RAM on its base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, ensuring that every user gets the best new AI technology, regardless of which size they choose or what budget they have.</p><p>From personalized morning and evening briefings to new tools that let you search for and modify just about everything on your phone, the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus are all about delivering excellent long-term value without a price hike. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on</a> also shows off the newly redesigned higher-end model if you're interested in that.</p><p>If I have one takeaway from my time with the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus at a special event in New York, it's that both phones deliver AI you'll actually care about and use daily. That's something I can't say about last year's models.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 launches at $799 and can be had in seven different colors. The first four, Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow, are available at your favorite retailer or carrier of choice. Ordering from Samsung.com gives you three additional options to choose from — Blue Black, Coral Red, and Pink Gold — plus a slew of launch promotions that'll save you some serious dough.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus bumps up the size and starts at $999. It comes in all the same color choices as the base S25 — including those Samsung.com exclusive ones — as well as the same RAM and storage options. The main reasons to choose the Plus model are the larger display and larger internal storage options. Otherwise, both phones are nearly identical.</p><p>You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">preorder both models now</a> and there are plenty of deals that bring the price of both phones much, much lower!</p>

<p>For the first time, all three Samsung Galaxy S25 models feature the same amount of RAM. This is to ensure that all AI tasks perform identically across every device in the line and makes the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus look more attractive than ever.</p><p>While many of last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a> were only great for a few niche situations, this year's new Galaxy AI features are ones that most of us will begin to use every day. Samsung breaks down the new features into three main categories: AI Agents, an integrated AI platform, and personalized AI.</p><p>The first AI feature you may find is when long-pressing the power button, which now brings up the AI Agent display. This displays what appears like a redesigned Google Assistant UI, but changes a bit depending on the app on-screen.</p><p>If you're watching a video on YouTube and pull up the AI Agent, two new buttons appear: "Talk Live About This," and "Ask About This Video". The AI Agent can <em>watch the video for you</em> and pick out key elements, then drop these ideas into a note.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kNeMymzXMniNk2VikMqtqN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-Galaxy-AI-Agent-YouTube-summary" alt="Galaxi AI creates a summary of a YouTube video on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kNeMymzXMniNk2VikMqtqN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>AI Agents can summarize videos nearly instantly and enable a slew of context-sensitive actions on any video, image, or text.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In one example, we pulled up a cooking video on YouTube and asked it to show us the recipes inside. We then asked a follow-up question to get the exact recipe of one of the mentioned ideas in the video. Each of these prompts was followed by a few seconds of processing time while the AI Agent connected to YouTube, which was impressive considering the video was over an hour long.</p><p>In another example, the AI Agent was asked to “find vegan restaurants around me and text them to Peter.” Just 5 seconds later, the Gemini-powered Agent returned five results with each address and asked to confirm sending the message to Peter.</p><p>It's important to note that if you ask it to find something and make a note, it'll automatically make the note with the information it found. Asking it to find something and send a message will always ask for confirmation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SRFQV6cvWSowY2hf4PsoS7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-AI-select-02" alt="Using AI Select on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus to get context-sensitive actions from an image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SRFQV6cvWSowY2hf4PsoS7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>AI Select lets you extract text from images, get generative suggestions, turn a video into a GIF, and more.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This search feature can be used for all Google and Samsung apps, plus Spotify and WhatsApp at launch. That means you can ask it to search for your upcoming flight in Gmail, and it'll be able to do it. You can even do complex queries like “find the next Chevelle concert, add it to my calendar, and text my wife.”</p><p>You can also now use natural language search in the settings app, gallery app, and a few other places. This lets you easily find photos or videos from a specific place or moment in time using more natural language. It can also bring up settings so you don't have to bumble through the settings menu to find what you're looking for.</p><p>Another extremely useful new feature is AI Select, an upgraded version of the once S Pen-exclusive Smart Select feature that adds actionable information to the things you highlight on the screen. The UI is very similar to Circle to Search, but instead of returning search results, you'll be able to extract text from images, get generative suggestions, turn a video into a GIF, and more.</p><p>It works on all images, videos, and text in any app, and Samsung says it won't interrupt your workflow, unlike similar features in the past. That means apps like Instagram won't reload and refresh your feed just because you want to look up something.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Hc8hxDXXigwE2DURvcra2c" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-morning-brief-01" alt="Galaxy AI Now Briefing and morning brief on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hc8hxDXXigwE2DURvcra2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Now Briefing feels a lot like the Google Now feed of yesteryear, and I'm not sure that's a good thing.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The last big new feature set is Personalized AI, which I think is a collection of hit-and-miss ideas. A morning briefing on your day will appear on the lock screen and the new default widget on the home screen, giving you a quick catch-up on the weather, your calendar, and any other events it thinks are pertinent. You'll receive a similar daily summary at night, although I didn't see this one because my hands-on session was in the morning, and it didn't have anything to summarize.</p><p>Personalization is key here because, without it, the briefing screen is pretty devoid of info. A lot of this reminds me of the old Google Now screen that apparently no one used because Google got rid of it. We'll see if the same thing happens with Samsung.</p><p>It's not all superfluous, though, as this same technology can be used to automatically create routines based on how you use your smart home or when you commute to work. Routines are super cool, but I've never bothered to use them because they are too much work to make and plan out. The Samsung rep giving the presentation said the same thing, funny enough, so I know I'm not alone.</p>

<p>Both the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus look pretty similar to last year's phones, but that doesn't mean there's no improvement. The rails around the entire phone are totally flat, with curved corners designed to make the phone more comfortable in your palm. Each colorway has its own matching colored rails, which sport a nice matte texture.</p><p>The front and back glass are also 100% flat, making it easy to slap a screen protector on in no time flat. The bezel around the displays of both models has been slightly reduced, and both models are lighter, as well. That's 6g less for the base Galaxy S25 and 7g lighter for the S25 Plus compared to their equivalent S24 models.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Both models are slightly lighter despite no change in battery size.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The raised camera lenses on the back have been ruggedized a bit with thicker outer layers that look rather nice on top of the flat glass. This won't fix the wobble you'll get when putting the phone down on a table, but they should help protect against lens breakage if you drop the phone.</p><p>These displays don't feature any meaningful hardware improvements or changes over the ones found on the Galaxy S24 family. Both models use a 480hz PWM rate with no option to disable PWM at high brightness in favor of DC dimming, as most other Android flagships now offer.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung didn't detail any display enhancements or new eye health features, and the anti-glare coating is only available on the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Samsung did include its Proscaler engine from the company's TV line, however, which automatically converts all video and photo content to match the phone's display resolution. This feature cannot be turned off and runs no matter which resolution you choose for the display. Samsung says it should make everything pop like ever before, but we'll need to test those claims in the review.</p><p>Neither the Galaxy S25 nor Galaxy S25 Plus have the anti-glare coating that's applied to the S25 Ultra.</p><p>While the glass isn't different from the S24 line, Samsung pointed out that it is better than what was offered on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a> and older, citing that the company saw a 60% reduction in screen repairs for the S24 versus previous generations of Galaxy S devices.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="TnSftznBShisVRkjYUY3S5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-display-lock-screen-01" alt="Customizing the lock screen in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnSftznBShisVRkjYUY3S5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus feature a handful of spec improvements over the S24, but they're mostly minor improvements. The lone exception is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor which sports a huge jump in performance.</p><p>Users can expect huge speed boosts when coming from any previous Galaxy phone, particularly anything S23 and older. This processor boasts 40% better NPU performance — that's mainly used for AI processing — as well as a 37% CPU and 30% GPU performance upgrade.</p><p>While these numbers usually equate to a very hot phone, Samsung said it not only increased the vapor chamber size on the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus by 15% compared to the S24 line, but the company is also using a new Tailored TiM layer for extra thermal efficiency. In short, that should help pull more heat away from the processor and out of the phone instead of slowing the phone down when it's busy.</p><p>In terms of real-gaming world performance, Samsung says that this new processor is 40% better at processing ray tracing, and any games that use Vulkan will see a further 18% performance improvement over the S24 line.</p>

<p>Samsung has upgraded Knox this year, now including upgraded encryption methods and what it calls “post-quantum encryption” that's designed to guard against future quantum computing attacks.</p><p>Better encryption is vitally important now that you're carrying around an entire LLM on your phone, helping to ensure that all that personalized data built around you stays local to your phone.</p><p>Battery life improvements this year will be found solely in efficiency improvements of the processor, as there are no display or battery size changes over last year. Additionally, Samsung hasn't made any changes to the charging speed or capabilities. That, unfortunately, means no Qi2 MagSafe charging built into the phones.</p><p>The company didn't have any cases or accessories for us to test at the event, so I can't speak to the capabilities of what Samsung may offer there.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="42zoFP7EDYb3bxqECmZK7U" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-camera-viewfinder-01" alt="The camera viewfinder on a Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42zoFP7EDYb3bxqECmZK7U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>New photo and video editing options are the main draw of the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus's camera experience, as there have been no hardware changes this year.</p><p>A new auto button will use Galaxy AI to analyze a photo or video and give you direct a one-click editing suggestion. This should help better surface hidden features like reflection eraser and shadow eraser, as well as the new audio eraser for video.</p><p>That Audio Eraser tool one-ups Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Magic Audio Eraser</a> on the Pixel by remaining completely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a>. That means you don't have to subscribe to any service or let your data go to the cloud to use it. It was super fast in our testing and impressively separated each audio channel as the AI analyzed things like a person's voice, background noise, and others. Adjusting each channel was simple, thanks to the excellent UI design.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-portrait-studio-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Portrait Studio</a> now has more realistic portraits with better facial expressions and natural tones. You can still only select from four style options, so it's not exactly as full-featured as some of the similar apps you can find on the Play Store. Samsung keeps all that processing data local, though, so there's no worry about your face ending up in some database somewhere.</p><p>Pro mode has been enhanced with several new features including Galaxy LOG with exclusive LUTs. If you don't know what this is, you probably don't need it, but it's going to be an exciting addition for folks who love to capture video. Pro mode also has a new virtual aperture that lets you make photos or videos taken in pro mode look more like they came from a DSLR.</p>
<p>You can now capture 10-bit HDR video from all four cameras on either phone, adding a brilliant layer of shine to your videos.</p><p>Nighttime videos are also seeing some big improvements thanks to a new spatial-temporal filter that analyses each frame and separates moving objects from still objects in real-time. In effect, this means the phone should be able to better capture moving subjects while keeping the rest of the frame from becoming over or under-exposed.</p><p>It's a fascinating new concept in per-pixel image calculation that phones already do, this time exclusively for low-light video capture.</p>

<p>If you're coming from an older Galaxy S device, upgrading to the Galaxy S25 or Galaxy S25 Plus should be pretty amazing. You'll get the latest version of Android and tons of new AI features you didn't previously have, plus more RAM, a substantially faster processor, and a better camera experience than ever.</p><p>Samsung isn't changing what has been working for the company which means this is yet <em>another </em>iterative update over last year. Throughout the product briefing, Samsung talked about how customers coming from the Galaxy S21, S22, or even the Galaxy S23 series will see significant improvements in everyday use with the Galaxy S25 series. That's key to understanding if the Galaxy S25 is the right phone for you, as it's not terribly exciting year-over-year but looks quite attractive if you're coming from something much older.</p><p>Based on my hands-on time, these seem like solid flagship phones that are even more attractive since Samsung boosted important specs — like RAM — matching that of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, all without raising the price. Plus, with seven years of software upgrade support, there won't be much of a reason to upgrade for a long time, especially if Samsung continues to deliver iterative upgrades like this each year.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus follows closely on the heels of the S24 Plus, a phone we absolutely loved. The big reason for that is the return of the QHD+ resolution for the Plus model, which made the premium worth it. The Galaxy S25 Plus retains all that goodness but takes it up a notch with an even lighter design, a more powerful chip, and a ton of new Galaxy AI features.</p><p>This also puts it in direct competition with the iPhone 16 Plus, a phone that also happens to be the middle child in Apple's lineup. It's priced the same and has the same display size, which will make you stop and think for a minute before going with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-hands-on-galaxy-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>. The 16 Plus has its own merits, like the powerful A18 SoC, support for Apple Intelligence, and a pixel-packed display. Here's my take on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. iPhone 16 Plus conundrum.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-iphone-16-plus-design-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. iPhone 16 Plus: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hRJQqw96zQVP87BnpaGpsF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-back-mint-01" alt="The back of the Mint Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hRJQqw96zQVP87BnpaGpsF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus looks pretty much identical to the S24 Plus. The side rails and front and rear glass are now completely flat. The new shades include Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow, all of which look pretty neat. Compared to its predecessor, the S25 Plus is now 7.3mm slim and weighs only 190g. These are lower numbers compared to the 16 Plus. The overall dimensions are more compact, too, which makes it easier to hold.</p><p>The S25 Plus still uses the Armor aluminum frame and has Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back for scratch protection. The rings around the rear camera lenses have been ruggedized, which actually contrasts well with the back panel. The phone is still IP68 rated for dust and water resistance.</p><p>The display on the S24 Plus has stayed pretty much the same. It's a 6.7-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel with a 120Hz refresh rate. The dimming tech is also the same PWM variety, with no option to switch to DC dimming even at higher brightness levels. This shouldn't be an issue for most, but it will if you are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a>.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Plus is not winning any design awards either, as it's pretty much the same as the 15 Plus, except for the alignment of the rear cameras. That being said, it's one of the best-built smartphones you'll find. The in-hand feel is excellent, thanks to the matte side rails and frosted glass back. It also comes in some fun, pastel colors that will appeal to many. The 16 Plus weighs 199g and is 7.8mm thick. This is more than the S25 Plus but not significant enough that you'll be uncomfortable carrying it around.</p><p>The 16 Plus also has color-matched aluminum side rails and buttons. It uses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/usb-c-iphone-15-what-this-means-for-accessory-makers">USB-C port</a> for charging, so it's widely compatible with any USB-C accessory. The 16 Plus gets a new feature seen on the new Pro models too, and that is Camera Control. It's a dedicated button on the lower right side of the frame that lets you control various aspects of the camera app with just swipes and presses.</p><p>The iPhone 16 Plus has the same 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display with HDR10 and Dolby Vision playback. The max brightness here reaches up to 2,000 nits. The screen resolution is a bit lower than the S25 Plus at 1,290x2,796, but you'll hardly ever notice this since the pixel density is still about 460ppi. The only drawback of this display is the paltry 60Hz refresh rate, which is such an Apple thing to do.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NuRaNYy5NDHVahvxNrpcNd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-display-AI-012" alt="Samsung Health's new AI features on a Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NuRaNYy5NDHVahvxNrpcNd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus starts at $999 for 256GB of storage and should be $1,199 for the 512GB variant. These are the same prices as the S24 Plus. Both variants will get 12GB of RAM. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">Preorders</a> begin immediately and the phone will go on open sale from February 7.</p><p>Like the rest of the S25 series, the Plus model is also powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for Galaxy SoC. This is a custom chip built by Qualcomm and Samsung that promises the best performance for the curated AI experiences in One UI 7. To mitigate heat and potential throttling, Samsung says it has used a 15% larger vapor chamber and a new Tailored TiM layer for more effective heat transfer. We'll be testing all these efficiency claims in the full review.</p><p>There's not much change to the rest of the specs of the S25 Plus. It has the same 4,900mAh capacity and the same wired and wireless charging speeds. The cameras are also pretty much unchanged. There's a 50MP main, 12MP ultra-wide, and a 10MP telephoto on the back. The front has a 12MP camera with autofocus. There are some new software changes, though, like AI Audio Eraser and the ability to shoot Galaxy LOG videos in Pro mode.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Plus starts at $899, but this is for the 128GB variant, which many should avoid. The 256GB variant is $999, and the 512GB is $1,199, both exactly the same as the S25 Plus. The iPhone uses 8GB of RAM, which doesn't sound like much, but it's the same amount that's used even in the Pro models.</p><p>The 16 Plus gets a new A18 chipset, which features a 5-core GPU, 16-core NPU, and a 6-core CPU. The performance benefits compared to even the iPhone 15 Plus are said to be pretty substantial. Apple is claiming 30% better GPU and 40% better CPU performance than before.</p><p>Apple doesn't really disclose the actual battery capacity, but it should be similar to the 15 Plus. Apple is touting up to 24 hours of streamed video playback. You can even charge the battery up to 50% in 35 minutes using Apple's 20W adapter. You get the same set of cameras, too, which include a 48MP main and 12MP ultrawide sensor on the back and a 12MP selfie camera.</p>

<p>Software is going to be a major deciding factor when choosing the Galaxy S25 Plus or iPhone 16 Plus, as it is most of the time. Samsung is going all out on AI with the S25 series in the hopes that no one notices the insignificant changes made to the hardware. The three pillars of the new AI features in One UI 7 are AI Agents, personalized AI, and integrated AI platform.</p><p>Gemini can be activated with a long press of the power button. You can use it to summarize long videos in an instant, and it can fetch context-sensitive information on any text, image, or video. You can also do cross-app actions with a simple natural language command. For instance, you can ask the phone to search for your next flight details and send them to a family member. The AI will look up Gmail, find the details, and then ask for your confirmation before sending it via the app you specify. All Google and Samsung apps are supported, along with two third-party ones like WhatsApp and Spotify.</p><p>Lastly, personalized AI will learn from your usage habits and build a local LLM that's protected behind Knox. As you use your phone, Morning Brief will give you a summary of your tasks for the day, while Evening Brief will let you know about your missed goals, upcoming reminders, and so on.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16 Plus ships with iOS 18, but the headlining feature was rolled out only in late 2024. Apple Intelligence became available for iOS users with the 18.1 update, and additional capabilities like Image Playground, Genmoji, and Writing Tools enhancements came in with iOS 18.2 in December. ChatGPT is now supported, so if Apple Intelligence isn't able to figure out your query, it will forward that request to ChatGPT.</p><p>You can rest assured that the iPhone 16 Plus will deliver a buttery smooth experience. iOS 18 introduces a host of new customization options, like the ability to change the tint of app icons. You can now lock or hide apps that you want to safeguard, and Control Center gets a new look.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 and iPhone 16 Plus both offer great value and have their own individual ecosystem benefits. If you're not too concerned about being loyal to any one platform, I'd suggest going with the S25 Plus. It's easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> today and is better than the iPhone 16 Plus in a few key ways, like the extra telephoto camera, better AI features, longer software support, and a smoother display. These might seem like small misses for the iPhone, but collectively, they amount to a lot.</p><p>If you've been a long-time iPhone user, then you already know what you want. The iPhone 17 Plus is still a long time away, so you can safely get the 16 Plus now without any worry of sudden price cuts. It easily delivers a great experience, you'll have Apple Intelligence, and the battery life should be better than the base model.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Still a solid phone</strong></em></p><p>It's true that the Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus is a two-year-old smartphone, but it's also true that it's still capable in 2025. It's powerful, and supports just enough AI. The Galaxy S23 Plus got nearly all of the Galaxy S24 Plus' AI features last year, so there's hope it could steal a few of the Galaxy S25 Plus features too.</p></p>

<p>It's that time of year again, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus has been officially revealed. The latest plus-sized Galaxy S25 model shares a lot of similarities with older Galaxy phones, like the two-year-old Galaxy S23 Plus. However, the new Galaxy S25 Plus is not without improvements, like a snappy Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor and brand-new Galaxy AI features.</p><p>What does that mean for current Galaxy S23 Plus owners? The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 smartphone is still capable in 2025, and will soon get the boost to One UI 7. While there are a handful of reasons Galaxy S23 Plus users might want to upgrade to the Galaxy S25 Plus, there may be just as many reasons for sticking with the older model for another year or two.</p><p>If you're on the fence, we have the full breakdown of how the new Galaxy S25 Plus compares to the old Galaxy S23 Plus.</p>

<p>For all intents and purposes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-hands-on-galaxy-s25-plus-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</a> and the Galaxy S23 Plus look the same from the outside. There are some small tweaks, like the Galaxy S25 Plus' DSLR-style camera covers, boxy shape, and slightly-larger screen. In terms of dimensions, the two phones are nearly identical. The newer Galaxy S25 Plus measures 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3mm, while the older Galaxy S23 Plus measures 157.8 x 76.2 x 7.6 mm.</p><p>It's nice that, despite featuring a larger screen and battery, the Galaxy S25 Plus is both thinner and lighter than the Galaxy S23 Plus. The newer model is 0.3mm thinner and six grams lighter, which probably doesn't sound like much but could make the Galaxy S25 Plus feel better in the hand.</p>

<p>The two phones' use the same display technology, but the Galaxy S25 Plus has a 6.7-inch screen while the Galaxy S23 Plus has a 6.6-inch screen. They're both AMOLED 2x panels with 120Hz variable refresh rate capabilities. The Galaxy S25 Plus will be slightly taller and have slimmer bezels, for what that's worth.</p><p>Aside from these minuscule differences, the two phones are built very similarly. They both have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> coverings for the display and back glass, as well as an aluminum chassis. In terms of dust and water-resistance, there is an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-waterproof">IP68 certification</a> for both phones. All told, if you're not a smartphone enthusiast, you may not notice much of a difference between these two devices.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-galaxy-s23-plus-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. Galaxy S23 Plus: Hardware and specs</h2>
<p>The differences on the inside matter much more than the ones on the outside. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus has a system-on-a-chip (SoC) that's two generations newer than the one inside the Galaxy S23 Plus, as expected. That doesn't tell the whole story, though, because the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for Galaxy chip powering the new model is a huge advancement. This particular variant was co-designed by Samsung and Qualcomm and uses the Oryon cores from Qualcomm's successful Snapdragon X lineup of laptop processors.</p><p>In other words, the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy represents much more than an incremental update. The 3nm chip is a huge deal for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, and it'll crush the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip (4nm) in the Galaxy S23 Plus in a few ways. Namely, the Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile platform excels in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a> and gaming performance. That'll be crucial if you care about having the latest and greatest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features.</p><p>On top of that, the Galaxy S25 Plus has more RAM (12GB) and battery capacity (4,700mAh) than the Galaxy S23 Plus. It also supports newer connectivity protocols, like Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, and UWB.</p>

<p>In terms of camera hardware, you may be disappointed (or relieved) to learn that the Galaxy S25 Plus and the Galaxy S23 Plus have the same exact lenses. The main camera is a 50MP, f/1.8 lens, and that's paired with a  12MP, f/2.2 ultrawide camera and a 10MP, f/2.4 telephoto camera capable of 3x optical zoom.</p><p>It's possible that you may see better results with the Galaxy S25 Plus thanks to AI magic, computational photography, and better image-signal processing. However, it's clear that camera quality is once again not a good reason to upgrade from the Galaxy S23 Plus to a newer model.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, ships with the Galaxy S25 Plus and will come to older models later. That means the Galaxy S23 Plus still has a few OS upgrades left, but it's clear that the Galaxy S25 Plus will have the edge in longevity. The flagship will get seven years of software support, including full OS upgrades and security patches. In theory, the phone you buy today could serve you well into the next decade.</p><p>The argument for sticking with the Galaxy S23 Plus is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">it'll also get One UI 7</a>, which is heralded as the biggest Samsung update in years. In fact, Samsung tells us that this version of One UI 7 has been in the works for three years. As such, updating to One UI 7 could make the Galaxy S23 Plus feel new and fresh, even if it's a few years old.</p><p>However, some features will be exclusive to the Galaxy S25 Plus due to its NPU and additional processing power. That includes enhanced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> functionality, AI agents, and cross-app actions. These features could make their way to other Galaxy phones in the future, but for now, they're exclusive to the newest models.</p>

<p>While the Snapdragon 8 Elite is a groundbreaking chip, and the Galaxy S25 Plus' new AI features are cool, I'm not sure that's enough to convince Galaxy S23 Plus owners to upgrade. The overall design of the Galaxy S25 Plus is the same, and the camera hardware is completely unchanged.</p><p>If you're eager to have the newest and best AI features — and value longevity — upgrading might not be such a bad thing. However, I'd consider rocking the Galaxy S23 Plus for another year to see if the next Galaxy phone is a more compelling upgrade.</p>

<p>Following months of rumors and leaks, both the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and the OnePlus 13 have been officially revealed. By the looks of it, these two smartphones will be the flagships to beat in 2025. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is arguably the more well-rounded and versatile pick, packing an S Pen and more cameras. But the OnePlus 13 is undoubtedly the better value, providing a Snapdragon 8 Elite device for under $1,000.</p><p>So, which one is best for you? Even though the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the OnePlus 13 are both some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> you can buy, there seems to be a clear answer this year. To find out everything there is to know about these two phones and discover which one should be your next smartphone, read on.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> was officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">revealed at a Galaxy Unpacked event</a> on Jan. 22, 2025. Surprisingly, all three Galaxy S25 models maintain the same pricing as the Galaxy S24 series. That means the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra starts at $1,299 for the 256GB variant. You can upgrade it to 512GB or 1TB for an additional fee and can choose from Titan Black, Titan Gray, Titan Silverblue, or Titan Whitesilver colorways.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> debuted globally in early January 2025. Although it costs more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>, its $899.99 starting price is still well below the Galaxy S25 Ultra's MSRP. The phone can be configured with either 12GB, 16GB, or 24GB RAM and up to 1TB of storage for an additional fee. It's available in white, blue, and black colorways.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-oneplus-13-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. OnePlus 13: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qXVPuW8d5wCXbLf6u7V3gd" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-01" alt="The back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13 on a wooden tea tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qXVPuW8d5wCXbLf6u7V3gd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the OnePlus 13 and the Galaxy S25 Ultra were significantly redesigned this year, even if that isn't obvious at a glance. The OnePlus 13 conforms with the new industry trends of rectangular, boxy phones — mostly ditching the curved display that characterized its recent flagships. However, some OnePlus staples are certainly still here, like the polarizing camera bump and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-alert-slider">handy alert slider</a>.</p><p>Samsung did the opposite with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It's now slightly curvier, taking cues from the design language of the standard Galaxy S25 models. The rounded corners and chamfered edges should make it easier to hold the Galaxy S25 Ultra in the hand. While the screen is bigger, the overall footprint isn't. That's because Samsung slimmed the Galaxy S25 Ultra bezels by 15% to accommodate a more favorable screen-to-body ratio.</p><p>To that end, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is thinner than the OnePlus 13, measuring 162.8 x  77.6 x 8.2 mm. At 218 grams, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a bit heavier than the 210 or 213-gram OnePlus 13. The 162.9 x 76.5 x 8.5 mm or 8.9 mm dimensions of the OnePlus 13 are quite similar to that of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, for what it's worth.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uDfjDiCdA8AFX9FPtt2r9k" name="top-down-view-home-screen-all-four-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Top-down view of Home Screen on four Galaxy S25 Ultra colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDfjDiCdA8AFX9FPtt2r9k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a bigger, 6.9-inch AMOLED display with 120Hz variable refresh rate support. It also works with the inbuilt S Pen, albeit without Bluetooth Low Energy this time around. There are the aforementioned slim bezels, plus a hole-punch cutout for the 12MP front-facing camera.</p><p>By comparison, the OnePlus 13 features a 6.82-inch AMOLED screen with 120Hz variable refresh rate support. It's also capable of 4,500 nits of peak brightness, which will help with outdoor viewing. The OnePlus 13 uses the company's "Ceramic Guard" glass, while the Galaxy S25 Ultra uses a new version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-armor-galaxy-s24-ultra">Gorilla Armor</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is technically more durable than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, since it features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">both IP68 and IP69 protection</a> against dust and water ingress. This enables flashy marketing stunts, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-phone-makers-want-your-smartphone-to-survive-a-kitchen-nightmare">like sticking the OnePlus 13 in a dishwasher</a>, but IP68 will probably be enough for daily use.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-oneplus-13-performance-and-hardware-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. OnePlus 13: Performance and hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kQjsChm2C7uhuqUKdxqYWH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kQjsChm2C7uhuqUKdxqYWH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the OnePlus 13 and the Galaxy S25 Ultra have Snapdragon 8 Elite processors on the inside, but they're not equal. The OnePlus 13 uses the stock Snapdragon 8 Elite processor from Qualcomm, while Samsung is using a custom <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for Galaxy variant. The two chips use Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores, which were first designed for the company's Snapdragon X family of laptop chips.</p><p>However, unlike in the past, this isn't just an overclocked version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite system-on-a-chip. Samsung says this is the first time it co-designed a custom application processor with Qualcomm. This could help the Galaxy S25 Ultra outperform the OnePlus 13 and be more efficient despite having less RAM and battery capacity. The Galaxy S25 Ultra also sports a 40% larger vapor chamber than last year, which should help keep the beastly Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip under control in terms of thermals.</p><p>Still, it's worth emphasizing that the OnePlus 13 and its standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip will still be a top performer, and the included NPU enables on-device AI features.</p>

<p>Camera hardware is another reason to buy a top-tier flagship like the OnePlus 13 or Galaxy S25 Ultra. The latter is still headlined by a 200MP main camera sensor, and it's paired with a brand-new 50MP ultrawide lens. There are also two telephoto cameras: a 10MP, 3x zoom lens and a 50MP, 5x zoom lens. This rear camera system helps the Galaxy S25 Ultra take high-quality zoom shots and shoot Log Video at up to 4K 120FPS.</p><p>Meanwhile, the OnePlus 13 falls short in optical zoom quality. It has a 50MP f/2.4 periscope telephoto lens, but it can only do 3x optical zoom. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review">The phone's other rear cameras are great</a>, with a 50MP f/1.6 main sensor and a 50MP f/2.2 ultrawide lens.</p><p>In terms of battery capacity, the OnePlus 13 has the edge. It has a 6,000mAh battery, whereas the Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 5,000mAh capacity. However, it remains to be seen whether Samsung's custom Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip helps the Galaxy S25 Ultra win in efficiency compared to the OnePlus 13.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jgxVqMxvcDdu2XGKpyNRVQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-vs-OnePlus-13-display-quick-toggles-01" alt="Comparing the size and shape of the displays on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jgxVqMxvcDdu2XGKpyNRVQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Software is the area that will make or break these phones. Some people really don't like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">OxygenOS 15</a>, which is OnePlus' Android skin based on Android 15. Or, others prioritize custom, on-device AI features. If you fit into either of those groups, you'll likely prefer the Galaxy S25 Ultra with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> to the OnePlus 13 with OxygenOS 15.</p><p>Samsung is taking a big leap with AI on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It's adding AI Agents that'll help take actions on your behalf, plus an integrated AI platform with cross-app support. It can complete multiple actions based on a single command across multiple apps, like Google apps, Samsung apps, or third-party apps like Spotify or WhatsApp. That's in addition to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">new Galaxy AI features</a>, an enhanced Circle to Search experience, and more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> functionality.</p><p>The OnePlus 13, by comparison, doesn't have nearly as many AI features. It'll also receive fewer years of software support — the OnePlus 13 will only get four years of OS upgrades. That's paltry compared to the seven years of support offered by Samsung.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-oneplus-13-which-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. OnePlus 13: Which should you buy?</h2>
<p>The OnePlus 13 and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra are both excellent smartphones, but it's clear the OnePlus 13 is the best value. You get a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, a big battery, and a premium design for under $1,000. That's hard to beat, even with the software compromises.</p><p>However, there's still a case for buying the Galaxy S25 Ultra. For about $400 more, the Galaxy S25 Ultra nets you a bigger screen with S Pen support, an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and better optical zoom. If you want the absolute best mobile hardware, it's still hard to say no to the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p>

<p>Great news! The Samsung Galaxy S25 has an IP68 rating. This rating means you can submerge the smartphone in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. IP stands for "Ingress Protection" and represents a grading system from the International Electrotechnical Commission, which defines how well Samsung protected the smartphone from water and dust.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 is shaping up to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a>, so we expected this rating. The first number, the six, means the smartphone is sealed tight from dust. However, a dustproof bag provides even more protection and extends the phone's lifespan by protecting it from scratches and other damage. The second number, the eight, means you can submerge the phone in up to 1.5 meters of water, but it's best to avoid submerging it.</p><p>While the phone has a high ingress protection rating, avoid exposing your new phone to harsh chemicals such as sugary drinks, cleaning products, or swimming in a highly chlorinated pool. If you accidentally spill these liquids onto your phone, rinse and dry it with a clean microfiber cloth as soon as possible.</p><p>Also, remember that the IP68 rating is the protection your phone has out of the box, but this rating can deteriorate over time without proper maintenance. Exposure to the elements and general use deteriorates the gaskets and seals. In addition, accidental drops and exposure to extreme temperatures can cause damage. Not taking your phone with you in hot showers is also a plus since this can also cause the rating to deteriorate faster.</p><p>The phone can survive an accidental drop in the bathtub or toilet or if you get caught in a rain storm, but you should never take it scuba diving with you since Samsung did not design it for those activities. To prevent salt damage to the primary microphone, earpiece, or external speaker, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS10001610/#:~:text=Whether%20you're%20a%20hiking,highest%20level%20of%20water%20protection." target="_blank">Samsung advises</a> against dropping your phone in the ocean. If you need to take your smartphone underwater, consider getting it in a protective case.</p><p>Samsung has also said that the touch screen may not work when the phone is wet. It also advises not to make calls immediately after it gets wet as the microphone may have water in it, which can lower the volume of your voice in the call.</p><p>Taking the necessary precautions protects your fancy new phone and its 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with a 120z adaptive refresh rate. That way, you can keep recording those great videos in 4K and juice it up afterward with Fast Wireless Charging 2.0.</p>

<hr>
<p>We're just beginning to process <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/phones/samsung-galaxy-s-25-series-launches">the Galaxy S25 launch</a>, but Google is highlighting the newest accessibility updates for Android.</p><p>In a press release, Google states that it's rolling out a series of updates to improve the hearing aid experience on Android. Before this hits other devices, the company states Samsung's Galaxy S25 series will benefit from these updates first. The hearing aid update will impact users with next-gen Bluetooth GN Hearing and Oticon Intent products.</p><p>Android is incorporating new LE Audio compatibility settings/features that lets users manage their hearing aids easier through "native settings" for preset edits. Moreover, users will find hands-free calling and new "lower latency Bluetooth connections."</p><p>Similar to the Pixel Buds experience, users with hearing aids can surface a quick menu on the Galaxy S25 series and see the battery level of each device. The included presets are All-Around, Meetings, Outdoors, and Restaurants. Users can edit these on the fly for whatever situation they find themselves in.</p><p>Google adds that while the Galaxy S25 is the first to receive this accessibility update, the S24 series will grab it "with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> in the coming weeks." Pixel 9 owners will also see this hearing aid update with the Android 16 beta.</p><p>The accessibility updates continue as Google highlights new things for Android's screenreader, TalkBack.</p><p>Users who rely on braille can use their Galaxy S25 series displays via HID. TalkBack is also preparing to offer more "detailed" image descriptions, thanks to Gemini on the newest Samsung phones "over the coming weeks."</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that braille display functionality via HID will arrive on more phones and tablets through Android 15 "over the coming months."</p>

<p>Google's rollout of better braille support on the Galaxy S25 is a testament to what it started last year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">during its Android 15 beta</a>. That first beta showed the company was working on improving braille display usage via HID over Bluetooth. Now, it seems that work has finally reached its apex and will arrive on the S25 series before hitting others.</p><p>Yesterday (January 21), Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">confirmed in a Korean Newsroom post</a> that One UI 7 (Android 15) will arrive on more Galaxy S series phones "imminently." While the company didn't say for certain, Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S23 users should be in line to receive this next major OS upgrade. However, Samsung states that its eligible Galaxy S series phones will grab One UI 7 in Q1 2025.</p><p>Other "existing" Galaxy devices will see it "thereafter," meaning its foldables and tablets will likely have to wait until Q2 and beyond.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/phones/samsung-galaxy-s-25-series-launches">debuted today</a> (January 22) during Unpacked. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">ultimate guide</a> to the series will be your hub for everything S25-related.</p>

<hr>
<p>As consumers stare down the launch of the Galaxy S25 series, Google is announcing a new update its search software on Android.</p><p>There are two major updates that will arrive on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/phones/samsung-galaxy-s-25-series-launches">the Galaxy S25 series</a>. According to a press release, the first part involves an expansion of Google's AI Overviews to its "visual searches." The company states this expansion into Circle to Search will apply to things circled or highlighted like places, "trending images," "unique objects," and more.</p><p>Google also states that users can use Circle to Search for an art piece to gather more information about it, thanks to the generative AI software.</p><p>It seems the software will try to identify what it's seeing in your circled/highlighted box. Once down, Circle to Search will now display an AI Overview first with quick bullet points and links for fact-checking. Moreover, users retain the ability to write a bit text in case they'd like to refine what the AI is searching for.</p><p>Joining this major AI Overview expansion is a QoL (quality of life) update for Circle to Search that brings "one-tap actions."</p><p>Google says Circle to Search will now "automatically identify" phone numbers, email addresses, and URLs. When this occurs, the company states users will see a new chip that they can tap to call that number, send an email, or head to a website. More importantly, Google warns that this feature "works on compatible apps" and that results "may vary" depending on the visual search.</p>

<p>We've already crossed Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a> anniversary, which took place during 2024's launch of the Galaxy S24 series. The feature hit Samsung's past-gen devices first, alongside Google's Pixel series before other Android phones. The star of the feature was the user's ability to highlight anything they see on their phone for a search on Google's engine. Those looking up clothes would find useful retail links to quickly purchase them.</p><p>Moreover, the original rollout of Circle to Search included AI Overviews; however, those quick snapshots weren't everywhere. The current update expands these to cover even more of what a user could look up.</p><p>Google also updated its AI Overviews <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-search-ads-video-function-update">with more organization</a> in its condensed format. Alongside that useful patch was a full-page experience that lets users dive into more relevant and important articles, forums, and more. The company states that users looking up information on recipes will find "top recipes" first, before diving into things regarding its ingredients or other variations.</p><p>Samsung revealed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/phones/samsung-galaxy-s-25-series-launches">Galaxy S25 series today</a> (January 22) during its Unpacked event.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is, like with previous generation Galaxy devices, the larger version of the entry-level phone in the new line. Available in Silver Shadow, Navy, Icy Blue, or Mint, it has a 6.7-inch 3,120 x 1,440 QHD+ dynamic AMOLED 2x screen with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and Vision Booster for clear views in bright sunlight.</p><p>It’s made of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 with an armor aluminum frame and IP68 rating. Curved corners make it comfortable in your hand, Nicholas Sutrich says in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Plus hands-on</a>. He loves that it’s lighter than the previous generation Galaxy S24 device as well.</p><p>Available with 256GB or 512GB storage, twice as much as the smaller Galaxy S25 (but less than the top option for the Google Pixel 9 Pro), it’s equipped with a 4,900mAh battery that supports 45W Super Fast Charging 2.0 as well as fast wireless charging and Wireless PowerShare.</p><p>For biometric security, you get an ultrasonic fingerprint reader on the screen as well as 2D facial recognition. The phone measures much larger than the Galaxy S25, hence the Plus name designation, though it’s only a smidge thicker. There’s also a new feature called post-quantum cryptography that safeguards your personal data against threats.</p><p>You’ll get seven years of OS and security updates with this phone, something that Samsung has committed to with all its recent Galaxy smartphone launches over the last several years.</p>

<p>Comparatively, the Google Pixel 9 Pro is made from aluminum and comes in Porcelain, Rose Quartz, Hazel, or Obsidian. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">his Pixel 9 Pro review</a>, Sutrich notes that the phone is flat in design, which is a personal preference if you like that set-up.</p><p>It has a smaller 6.3-inch Super Actua LTPO OLED screen that boasts a lower resolution at 2,856 x 1,280. But you do get up to 2,000 nits brightness and up to 3,000 nits peak brightness, so you can comfortably view the screen in all conditions, including direct sunlight. The screen is made of scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and the phone is IP68 dust and water-resistant with a fingerprint coating as well.</p><p>Available with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB storage, you may appreciate the larger storage options should you want to store more locally versus the cloud. Neither phone, it should be noted, has a microSD card expansion slot.</p><p>With the 4,700mAh battery, you get up to 24 hours of battery life per charge and up to 100 hours in Extreme Battery Saver mode. It supports fast charging with the separately purchased Google 45W USB-C charger, fast wireless charging, and Battery Share.</p><p>The phone is smaller, of course, since it has a much smaller screen, but it’s also slightly thicker and heavier. It has fingerprint and face unlock, along with plenty of safety features like crisis alerts, car crash detection, safety checks, and more. You also get Google VPN included along with the Titan M2 security chip.</p><p>Enjoy up to seven years of OS and security updates, along with frequent Pixel Drop updates.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus runs on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for Galaxy processor, making it a fast and snappy phone. Samsung says this processor, the most powerful to date in a Galaxy phone, boosts performance significantly and allows the phone to process more AI experiences <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a> versus via the cloud, including features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-galaxy-ai-generative-edit">Generative Edit</a>.</p><p>It comes loaded with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> out of the box, along with all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> goodies you would expect. This includes a new feature: cross-app action with AI Agent, which lets the phone perform actions on the user's behalf. When playing with the AI Agent, Sutrich found that it worked well, even calling up details he wanted from an hour-long recipe video without issue.</p><p>Upgrades with Samsung One UI 7 include a number of new features. There’s Now Brief that shows AI-powered insights for sleep, weather, daily schedule, and more. Auto Suggestions suggest things you can do to be more productive, like turning on a compatible smart washing machine based on your usual routine or turning on maps to navigate to a destination. With Multimodal Search, you can do things like hum a song you don’t remember the name of.</p><p>Samsung says the phone can now perform actionable searches with awareness of context, and you can easily switch between apps. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> also now recognizes phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and URLs on screen, so you can trigger a call, message, or web search with a single tap. It also boasts improved natural language understanding.</p><p>With 12GB RAM, you can multitask to your heart’s desire, enjoy mobile gaming, stream and capture high-res videos, and more. Speaking of which, there’s also an improved cooling system, Vulkan Engine, and improved Ray Tracing, which gamers especially will appreciate.</p>

<p>Looking at the Google Pixel 9 Pro, it’s an older phone that launched with Android 14, but it’s still updateable to Android 15 and beyond. It has more RAM at 16GB and comes equipped with the Google Tensor G4 processor alongside the Titan M2 security coprocessor.</p><p>You get tons of AI features with this phone as well, including instant access to the Gemini AI assistant, features like Circle to Search, and more. So, with both phones, you’re getting a premium AI experience with the ability to do things like summarize e-mails, get help composing content, create images, and more. It’s worth noting that this phone comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> for free for the first year, which allows you to try out all the features and functions before committing to a subscription if desired.</p><p>Other new features include more intelligent screenshots with a new app that even allows you to search for details within a screenshot, a new Pixel Weather app with a new UI and headliner AI summary feature, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a> for creating images from text prompts, and Call Notes for summarizing a phone call and delivering a transcript at the end.</p>

<p>The camera experience is key for smartphone owners now that our phones double as our on-the-go content capture devices. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus has some serious camera power. This is led by the 50MP wide AF OIS main camera, which is complemented by a 12MP ultra-wide camera and a 10MP 3x tele AF OIS camera. There’s also 30x space zoom, so you can get up close and personal with subjects without losing too much detail.</p><p>Additionally, you’ll find a 12MP wide AF “selfie” front camera for taking great self-portraits and group shots. The phone can also record 4K video at 60 frames-per-second and has the ProVisual Engine. You’ll also find features like HDR portraits, nightography, and even zebra pattern.</p><p>There are new ways to create and edit photos and videos using all the same AI features you found in the previous generation phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Samsung Galaxy S24</a>, as well as new features. Audio Eraser, for example, removes background noise and conversations in videos and isolates the sounds you want. Sutrich found that it works quickly and well.</p><p>With Auto Trim, you can remove things like excessive “ums” in your speech as well as blank spaces. You can even use keywords, and AI will determine which clips or sound bites can be removed from the video before the final edit. Nighttime videos have been improved as well, affording better capture of moving subjects without under- or over-exposing the rest of the video.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2RH4wQ2twBkBw4FfoNHZH8" name="google-pixel-9-pro-obsidian-back-04.jpg" alt="Holding an Obsidian Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RH4wQ2twBkBw4FfoNHZH8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the Google Pixel 9 Pro, it has a pro triple rear camera system with a 50MP wide camera, 48MP ultra-wide camera with Macro Focus, 48MP 5x telephoto lens, Super Res Zoom up to 30 x, and an impressive 42MP dual PD selfie camera with auto focus.</p><p>You get tons of pro controls and AI editing features for both photos and videos, from Night Sight to Astrophotography, portrait mode, Face Unblur, and more. Editing features include Google Pixel favorites like Magic Editor, Magic Eraser, Best Take, Photo Unblur, and Zoom Enhance. Sutrich’s favorite feature with this phone is called Add Me, which allows the photographer to add themselves to a group photo in post-editing using augmented reality. “The result was astounding and incredibly convincing,” he said of using this feature.</p><p>For videos, you can capture up to 8K video at 30 frames per second, with Video Boost coming soon to further enhance content capture. There’s also 20x Super Res Zoom Video. This phone has a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> feature along with other intelligent features to ensure you get the best video capture possible.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-which-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NuRaNYy5NDHVahvxNrpcNd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-display-AI-012" alt="Samsung Health's new AI features on a Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NuRaNYy5NDHVahvxNrpcNd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now comes the big decision: which should you buy, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus of the Google Pixel 9 Pro? Usually, the argument would suggest that the Google Pixel phone is cheaper, but Samsung has managed to bring the price to a reasonable level for this phone. In fact, it falls right in line with the Google Pixel 9 Pro when it’s on for its regular price (though you can often find the latter on sale).</p><p>So, when you take price out of the equation, you really need to get down to the nitty-gritty. Both phones rely heavily on AI perks. With Samsung integrating Google’s Gemini, which is, of course, also in the Google Pixel, you aren’t getting a leg up with the Galaxy S25 Plus. You are, however, getting a larger-screened phone with some additional Samsung-specific features that come with One UI 7. If these are ones you’d use, it might sway your decision.</p><p>However, the Google Pixel 9 Pro is still a solid phone with a lot of life left in it and plenty of impressive Google AI smarts, along with a snappy processor and even more RAM. With the option to get up to 1TB of built-in storage by paying a bit more, that could be a dealbreaker for some.</p><p>The familiar Samsung experience, the higher-res screen, the effective cooling for gamers, the Samsung One UI, and the larger screen are all compelling reasons to opt for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus. We can’t speak to the cameras yet until we conduct an extensive review. But for now, Google has Samsung beat when it comes to the front camera, while the others are relatively in sync.</p><p>It will come down to form factor, design, and platform. If you want a smaller phone, go with the Google Pixel 9 Pro. If you want something bigger and you’re familiar with and love the Galaxy interface, upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus if you’re still rocking a Galaxy phone that’s several years old. It will likely take the place of the Samsung Galaxy S24 among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> (or its smaller Samsung Galaxy S25 sister device). Keep in mind that if you want a smaller screen within the Galaxy family, you can also consider the near-identical Samsung Galaxy S25. Just keep in mind that it has a smaller battery and only goes up to 256GB of storage.</p>

<ul><li>You can now set up a Galaxy Watch 7 LTE to work as a standalone kids watch that supports calls and messages without a smartphone.</li><li>Using Google Family Link, you can monitor your kid's location, contacts, apps, and options during schooltime.</li><li>Galaxy Watch for Kids comes with over 20 "Teacher Approved apps and watch faces" with educational features.</li><li>The update will arrive "in the coming weeks," and requires parents to own a Galaxy smartphone.</li></ul>
<p>Samsung and Google teamed up on the new version of Wear OS years ago; now they've collaborated on a kid-friendly spinoff for Samsung's cellular-enabled smartwatches called Galaxy Watch for Kids that sounds extremely promising for parents.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/how-to-use-new-samsung-galaxy-watch-experience-for-kids-unpacked2025">Announced </a>just before the start of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-galaxy-s25-live-blog">Galaxy Unpacked 2025</a>, this new "kid-friendly smartwatch experience" lets you convert a regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 LTE</a> into one with built-in parental controls during the initial setup.</p><p>Once you set up the eSim, the Galaxy Watch 7 LTE becomes a standalone device, similar to Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a> except that it's not designed solely for kids; it could theoretically switch into a "normal" smartwatch if you buy your kid an Android phone in a couple of years.</p><p>Using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.kids.familylink&hl=en_US">Google Family Link app</a>, you'll be able to supervise their restricted Google account so they can only call or text approved contacts. It will also let you approve or block Wear OS apps and set a School Time window during which they can't use any distracting apps or features.</p><p>Like many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kids smartwatches</a>, Galaxy Watch for Kids will let you track your child's real-time location at any time using the built-in dual-band GPS — though the announcement doesn't mention any geofencing feature to auto-notify you if they leave a specific location like the school grounds.</p><p>Plus, this feature makes it easy to track down the last known position if your child loses the watch.</p>

<p>Google, which is handling the apps and software side for Samsung, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/wear-os/galaxy-watch7-kids-family-link">announced</a> new Galaxy Watch for Kids apps on the Play Store with the "Teacher Approved" badge, meaning they're age-appropriate and focus on educational areas like "math, science, history, music, creativity, emotional well-being, and physical activity."</p><p>The list of approved apps includes a virtual Rubik's Cube, a Marvel dancing app called "Groove with Groot," drawing encouragement from Barbie and Crayloa, a daily trivia game, a mood journal, and PBS Kids apps for learning more about animals or telling time.</p><p>Samsung says that "children can monitor their daily activities" and that parents and kids can "build healthier habits alongside each other by reviewing their health data together." This suggests that Galaxy Watch for Kids will have a full-fledged Samsung Health experience, tracking data like sleep, steps, and workouts.</p><p>Galaxy Watch for Kids currently only works on the Galaxy Watch 7 LTE; we'll ask if Google and Samsung have any plans to bring the feature to older generations with cellular support. And parents will need a Galaxy phone running One UI 5.1 or later.</p><p>It's also fair to point out that the Galaxy Watch 7 LTE — being a "real" smartwatch — is more expensive than most kids' watches, which trade limited (or specialized) feature sets for lower prices. You'll also have to add it to your carrier plan (for an additional fee) before calling and location tracking will work.</p><p>Google says the "Galaxy Watch for Kids experience will roll out to the Galaxy Watch 7 LTE in the coming weeks. It will initially be available in the U.S. on AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon networks." Samsung will give Watch 7 LTE buyers a free kids-themed band if you buy it on Samsung.com from today through February 22.</p>

<p>Google is rolling out new features to make classrooms better for both teachers and students, including enhanced Chromebook tools and new features in Google Classroom.</p><p>One of the new features is "Class Tools," designed to give teachers real-time control over managed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>. Now, educators can connect with students, share content directly, and even turn on Live Captions and Translations. The goal is to make lessons easier and keeping students hooked.</p><p>Google is also bringing Face Control to Chromebooks, so users can navigate with head movements and facial gestures.</p><p>Additionally, over 20 new Chromebook models are set for launch in 2025, from budget-friendly options like the Acer Chromebook Spin 511 for students to more powerful picks like the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 2-in-1 for teachers.</p><p>The Lenovo Chromebook Plus 2-in-1 is powered by Intel Core processors and features Google AI tools. It sports a 14-inch FullHD touchscreen, 11-hour battery life, and robust security with two-factor authentication and regular updates.</p>

<p>Big upgrades are also headed to Google Classroom. Teachers can now use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, Google’s AI model, to create custom vocabulary lists for different grade levels and topics.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I started using mobile controllers over the course of the last year with my phones. The ability to dock your phone or tablet to a mobile controller and play games is pretty great, but as much as I like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-plus-review">GameSir's G8 Plus</a>, it's not very portable — you can't take it around in your pocket.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="axMBnPWBEUrjYmABGgUws3" name="CRKD Atom" alt="CRKD Atom gaming controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/axMBnPWBEUrjYmABGgUws3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's where CRKD's Atom comes in. This is easily the smallest controller I ever used, and while I initially thought it was gimmicky, that isn't the case now that I used the product for a month. Even though it's astonishingly tiny, it actually feels great to hold and use, and the diminutive size makes it effortless to take anywhere. The best part is that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-ATOM-Collectible-Keychain-Controller-Nintendo/dp/B0DCZY6P5D">costs just $20 on Amazon</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hnqdGiTgMiAhr6iHgvdes3" name="CRKD Atom" alt="CRKD Atom gaming controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hnqdGiTgMiAhr6iHgvdes3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The controller has a D-pad, four action buttons, and you even get four shoulder-mounted triggers. Connecting it to your phone over Bluetooth is about as straightforward as it gets; just press down the CRKD logo and it goes into pairing mode (the device shows up as Pro Controller). As it is a regular Bluetooth controller, you can use it with your phone, tablet, PC, Switch, and your TV.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ng3Fia3PbnJMr9twQeCyv3" name="CRKD Atom" alt="CRKD Atom gaming controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ng3Fia3PbnJMr9twQeCyv3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Considering the size of the Atom, I used it predominantly with my phone. I played hours of Balatro using this controller, and it held up great; the D-pad and buttons have good feedback, and even the shoulder triggers have decent tactility — something I didn't think would be the case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EnruVYPSVab3FS3wuHL9x3" name="CRKD Atom" alt="CRKD Atom gaming controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EnruVYPSVab3FS3wuHL9x3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also like the color scheme of the controller; I got the Glacier Blue model, and it has a see-through design that showcases the internals, including the switches behind the triggers. There are eight colors in total, so you get a decent amount of customizability in that area.</p>

<p>The controller is made out of plastic, and build quality is great; my 19-month-old loves taking this controller and mashing the buttons, and she occasionally throws it around. After a month of extensive use, the Atom is still going strong. The only thing I'll mention in this regard is that if you're going to hook the Atom to a keyring, it will pick up scratches. Outside of that, there are no problems with the design or build quality of the controller, and having used it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, I didn't see any issues while gaming.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SWYegT2gcnPmt9grfHbCr3" name="CRKD Atom" alt="CRKD Atom gaming controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SWYegT2gcnPmt9grfHbCr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, you're limited in the games that you can play with the controller as you don't get any thumbsticks. That said, it did a decent job in retro titles as well, but there were instances where buttons wouldn't register, and there's no way to manually program buttons in titles like you get with most mobile gaming controllers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wAchy4bvbkBeSz7gwe7Sx3" name="CRKD Atom" alt="CRKD Atom gaming controller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wAchy4bvbkBeSz7gwe7Sx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Atom lasts over eight hours on a charge, and it charges via USB-C. There's no fast charging, so the controller takes nearly two hours to charge the battery. Given the intended use case, battery life isn't a limitation on the device. <br><br>Overall, the Atom is pretty decent if you want a controller you can take anywhere. I thought it was too small to be usable, but that thankfully isn't the case, and the build quality and tactility of the buttons is much better than I imagined. This is a good choice if you need an affordable controller you can just carry around in your pocket.</p>

The Prime series consists of the manufacturer's best offerings, featuring elegant designs and the latest GaN tech. The Prime 27,650mAh is Anker's latest product in this portfolio, and with a power budget of 250W and the ability to charge three devices at once, it clearly has a lot going for it. <br><br>The power bank has a new design, with a seamless front that differentiates it from other products. And it isn't that massive considering you get a 27,650mAh battery — I have 25,000mAh power banks that are bulkier. There are other niceties as well, including an LCD panel that shows real-time details, magnetic connectors at the bottom that let you attach the power bank to a charging base, and three ports in total.<br> <br>I get to use a lot of power banks, and I've tested dozens of products in the last three years. So I'm confident when I say that the Prime 27,650mAh is the best power bank in this segment.</p>

It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG">costs $149 on Amazon</a>, and you can pick it up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.anker.com/products/a1340-250w-power-bank?variant=43739694465174">from Anker's website</a> as well. If you don't like the standard model with the grey color scheme, there's a gold-accented variant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0C85ZTH35">that retails for $153</a>.</p><p>The power bank costs £179 ($220) in the U.K., and it's available for ₹19,999 ($231) in India.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AbDo3Q4LFR7xcaEooc3fe3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AbDo3Q4LFR7xcaEooc3fe3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I mostly used UGREEN and Baseus power banks in recent years, and I have to admit Anker did a great job with the design. The power bank is smaller than a portable Bluetooth speaker while still offering a massive 27,650mAh battery, and that's a design win. If anything, UGREEN started emulating the vertical design with its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-25000mah-power-bank-review">Nexode power banks</a> after the success of the Prime, so Anker knows what it's doing in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pHQjTnrv7ZHUSsNfjwWGb3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pHQjTnrv7ZHUSsNfjwWGb3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The front has a cleaner look this time, and while the use of acrylic leads to increased smudging, it makes the design stand out. What I like is that there are textured sides, making it easier to hold the power bank. You get the two USB-C and solitary USB-A port at the top, and the bottom contains magnetic pins that can be used with the charging base.</p>
<p>There's a power button on the right, and like most recent power banks, the Prime 27,650mAh power bank has a built-in LCD panel that shows charging details. You get the battery remaining, time left to charge a connected device, and the power button lets you adjust the brightness and toggle Bluetooth.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ejjNfeChrZodZ3mFsDFpd3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ejjNfeChrZodZ3mFsDFpd3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part about this power bank is that in addition to the usual USB PD 3.1 charging standard, you get OPPO's SuperVOOC, making it the perfect choice to use with OnePlus and OPPO phones. This is a huge deal, as other power banks are limited to USB PD. But with Anker licensing SuperVOOC tech, it is able to provide the 10V/6.5A power profile necessary for the standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qKAffyvYxmp54wNVfWP4h3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qKAffyvYxmp54wNVfWP4h3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You'll need to use the USB-A port if you want to take advantage of SuperVOOC tech, with the USB-C ports only offering USB PD's power profiles. I used the power bank with a host of devices under the BBK conglomerate, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, and it did a fantastic job with all of these phones.</p>
<p>Another nifty trick is a trickle-charging mode that's ideal for charging accessories. You'll need to double-press the power button to toggle trickle-charging, and a green indicator LED shows up next to the battery indicator to show this mode is active. This mode uses the USB-A port, and you can connect earbuds, smartwatches, and any other accessories that don't need that much power. Double pressing the power button again switches the power bank back to USB PD mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2FbBpPwfRC24eDNsf8YGg3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2FbBpPwfRC24eDNsf8YGg3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you get two USB-C ports alongside USB-A, you can charge three devices at once. Here's a look at the various power profiles, and how it holds up when charging several devices at once:</p>
<ul><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 out (140W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W), 28V/5A (140W)</li><li><strong>USB-A out (65W max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/2A (18W), 12V/1.5A (18W), 10V/6.5A SuperVOOC (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 in (140W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W), 28V/5A (140W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 out (240W max): </strong>100W + 140W</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 + USB-A (205W max): </strong>140W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + USB-A (250W max):</strong> 140W + 92W + 18W</li></ul>
<p>Both the USB-C1 and C2 ports are able to deliver 140W of power over the USB PD 3.1 protocol, and what's interesting is that you get a total 240W power budget when both ports are in use, with one port able to hit 140W and the other going up to 100W. Similarly, you get 140W out of one USB-C port even when the USB-A port is being used at 65W.</p>
<p>The differentiator with this power bank is that even with all three ports in use, you get 140W over USB-C1, with the C2 port going to 92W, and the USB-A down to 18W. What I also like is that you get to charge the internal battery at 140W; other products I tested recently only do 140W one way, falling back to 100W when charging the battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Jqkrpqzc5E27MRQdyhH2h3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jqkrpqzc5E27MRQdyhH2h3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power bank contains seven 3,950mAh cells, totaling 27,650mAh. The battery size is just under the maximum allowed onto a plane (100Wh), and I didn't have any issues taking the power bank aboard a flight. It definitely got looks from gate security as they were curious about what it is, but there were no problems otherwise.</p>
<p>Charging efficiency is pretty good too, and I was able to charge the Vivo X200 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> in one go and still have battery left. It is in line with other power banks I tested recently, and the size of the battery combined with the 250W power budget makes this a great choice for travel — it's what I'm taking everywhere.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TWzBDDeeMWye2ovBgLwee3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TWzBDDeeMWye2ovBgLwee3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't have any problems with the power bank itself, and the only thing I would have liked is the charging base. The accessory charges the power bank at 100W, and it's so much more convenient than plugging it into a USB-C port. But it's available as a $50 extra, and not bundled with the package. <br><br>Outside of that and the fact that the front gets smudged easily, there are no problems with the Prime 27,650mAh power bank.</p>

<p>There's no shortage of power banks available today, and if you want a decent option with a big battery, I'd suggest the 65W Baseus power bank. It has a 30,000mAh battery, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/30000mah-Baseus-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B08JV4W4NY">coming in at $79</a>, it is a standout value. Obviously, you miss out on 140W charging and all the other extras, but it is affordable. <br><br>If you need 140W charging, I really like the Sharge 170. It also uses the USB PD 3.1 protocol and hits 140W, and the unique design turns heads. It's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SHARGEEK-Portable-Charger-Display-Waterproof/dp/B0D2VWVPRX">down to $129 now</a>, so while it isn't affordable, you get plenty of similar features as the Prime power bank.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best power bank currently available</li><li>You need to charge your MacBook via a power bank</li><li>You have a OnePlus phone and need a power bank that does 65W over SuperVOOC</li><li>You need charging stats</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You don't need the massive battery</li></ul>
<p>The Prime 27,650mAh power bank has been faultless in four months of use. I tested it with dozens of phones, several tablets, and a gamut of accessories — including the Steam Deck — and it did a brilliant job delivering a reliable charge to all connected devices. <br><br>The sizeable battery ensures it can easily charge several devices at once, and with both USB PD 3.1 and SuperVOOC compatibility, you get unmatched versatility — I haven't used any other power bank that charges OnePlus devices at 65W. Combine all of that with an elegant design and long-term reliability, and you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best overall power bank</a> money can buy today.</p>

Specifically, as Weibing answered burning user questions, he confirmed that the Xiaomi 15 Ultra will see a "simultaneous" release in China and globally following the Chinese New Year, otherwise known as the Spring Festival.</p><p>This leads speculation to <em>believe </em>that the phone will hit the market no later than February; however, Weibing did not explicitly say so.</p><p>Additional information (likely specs and a proper date) will reportedly be revealed by Xiaomi after the New Year.</p>

<p>We've been hearing talks about the Xiaomi 15 Ultra for a couple of months and more so after it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-alleged-delay-and-certification">supposedly hit with a striking delay</a>. Rumors from the Chinese social media platform, Weibo, claimed the OEM "postponed" its original planned release of the 15 Ultra. Strangely, rumors couldn't figure out the specific reason behind the alleged delay. Nonetheless, that's what were met with.</p><p>A subsequent post claimed to have spotted the device running through a certification listing with 90W fast charging, a battery between ~5,400mAh to ~5,800mAh, and satellite texting capabilities.</p><p>What made this delay so unfortunate is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-and-15-pro-with-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-announced-in-china">Xiaomi 15 and 15 Pro</a> debuted in October, but haven't made arrived globally yet. It seems as though the initial pair were awaiting the Ultra model. This rumored delay seemingly affected it as, aside from an FCC appearance, the devices have gone silent.</p><p>Furthermore, a February launch for all three devices seems plausible as Xiaomi did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-launch-and-14-ultra">something similar last year</a>. The company dropped its Xiaomi 14, 14 Pro, <em>and </em>14 Ultra globally on February 25. With the company's mobile phone department president claiming an arrival after the Chinese New Year, perhaps history will repeat itself.</p>

<p>With Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event only a day away, the company is confirming a bit of news we've all been waiting on.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/one-ui-7-%ea%b3%b5%ec%8b%9d-%eb%b2%84%ec%a0%84-%ea%b3%b5%ea%b0%9c-%ec%9e%84%eb%b0%95">Newsroom post</a> (Korean), Samsung confirmed that One UI 7 (Android 15) is preparing to launch on eligible Galaxy S series phones in Q1 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-rollout-galaxy-s-phones/">Android Police</a>). Unfortunately, the post didn't state which devices are slated primed to receive this update; however, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24 series</a> and the S23 will likely see the upgrade.</p><p>The company adds that while the One UI 7 upgrade will hit eligible Galaxy S devices in Q1, other "existing" Galaxy devices will receive it "thereafter." So, perhaps this means that devices like its foldables and tablets are waiting until Q2 or later.</p><p>Samsung continues by highlighting a successful One UI 7 beta program period. The company states that as the program began on December 5, it filled up "more than twice as fast as the previous One UI 6" beta. The company adds that many of the beta user comments were about its redesigned UI and "improved usability."</p><p>The post stepped into its Galaxy AI world, to which Samsung says were "praised." Specifically, the company says its updated "Writing Assist" feature was particularly positioned in the testers' good favor.</p>

<p>Samsung's beta program for its Android 15 skin continued as users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">received a third portion</a> of it earlier in January. The update introduced a host of bug fixes and improvements for various features concerning the software. The OS Game Booster brought in a change to the playback default setting, 120Hz setting, and more. One uI 7's third beta also included the vertical app drawer alongside an updated scrolling interface.</p><p>Elsewhere, Samsung has been busy confirming and highlighting several new features in One UI 7, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-sketch-to-image-multimodal-updates-teased">a multimodal upgrade</a> for Sketch to Image. The company states that the software will let users draw with an S Pen or type the description of an image they'd like Galaxy AI to create. This was wrapped in Samsung's supposed quest for a "true AI companion," which could mean <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-potential-bixby-upgrade-unpacked-teaser">more for Bixby, too</a>.</p><p>Samsung is also ramping up the privacy/security of One UI 7 for users through the new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-personal-data-now-bar-highlighted-report">Personal Data Engine</a>." The engine is backed by Knox Vault and is said to store a user's private information in a "secure place" when utilizing its on-device AI services. Then, there's the "Now Bar," which will find a home on the Galaxy S25's lock screen. The small widget will be deeply integrated with a user's apps and plans to deliver curated suggestions for the day.</p><p>With One UI 7 confirmed to hit more Galaxy S series phones in Q1, the big day <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">is only one sleep away</a> as Unpacked is slated for January 22.

<hr>
<p>A new leak of the Oppo Find N5 is making the rounds, showing off its design and giving us a peek at what the global version, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a>, might look like.</p><p>The Oppo Find N5 was previously rumored to be under 4.4mm when unfolded, which would dethrone the Honor Magic V3 as the slimmest foldable out there. OPPO seems to be obsessed with this ultra-thin vibe, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-really-hope-the-oneplus-open-2-doesnt-make-the-same-mistake-as-the-pixel-9-pro-fold">OnePlus CEO Pete Lau even compared it to a pencil</a>.</p><p>Now, as per a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/Pako9ofOQ" target="_blank">Weibo post</a> by the Chinese phone maker, the upcoming Oppo Find N5 foldable is so thin when unfolded, it’s almost as slim as its USB-C port (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/19/oppo-find-n5-oneplus-open-2-thin-design-teaser/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Oppo product manager Zhou Yibao shared images highlighting this impressive design and pointed out that the only thing keeping it from being even thinner is the size of the charging port itself.</p><p>Furthermore, the images show the Find N5 side by side with an iPhone, and the difference is wild. The foldable looks about half the thickness of the iPhone when unfolded, making it seriously compact.</p><p>Another image compares the N5's slim profile to a stack of two quarters or just four credit cards.</p>

<p>The upcoming foldables from Oppo and OnePlus may also raise the bar for water resistance. In another post, Zhou revealed the phone’s IPX9 rating, meaning it can handle high-pressure, high-temperature water jets. While it skips official dust protection (that’s what the ‘X’ means), it’s also rated IPX8 for submersion and IPX6 for lower-temperature water jets.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Foldable smartphones</a> often fall short when it comes to dust and water resistance. Take the OnePlus Open, for example—it only has an IPX4 rating, meaning it can handle light splashes but not much more. This lower level of protection is pretty common in foldables, likely because the complex folding mechanisms make it tricky to seal them up tightly.</p><p>The OnePlus Open 2 is likely to include the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, so expect some serious power under the hood. What’s really cool, though, is the massive battery—it’s rumored to be the biggest ever in a foldable.</p><p>Oppo is set to introduce its next-gen foldable in February, so the OnePlus Open 2 is probably not far off.</p>

<hr>
<p>Rumors have reportedly surfaced about what Samsung could have in store camera-wise for the future of Ultra model phones.</p><p>Prominent Weibo leaker, Digital Chat Station (DCS), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PasZcp1fa?pagetype=profilefeed">posted a claim</a> on the platform stating Samsung is working on a souped-up, high-zoom camera lens (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s26-ultra-200mp-telephoto-camera-rumor/">SamMobile</a>). Rumors claim the Korean OEM is starting to develop a new 1/1.5-inch periscope telephoto sensor at 200MP.</p><p>Strangely, the tipster didn't have any more details to share about the photography capabilities of this camera lens. The publication speculates this new hardware could arrive for future Galaxy S Ultra devices, like the Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:628px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.63%;"><img id="Fqig9UgXLCtfgcLUU5MwLR" name="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-periscope-telephoto-development-rumor" alt="A post on Chinese social media site, Weibo, from a leaker who claims Samsung is working on a 200MP periscope telephoto lens." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fqig9UgXLCtfgcLUU5MwLR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="628" height="274" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Digital Chat Station / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While there's no telling <em>when </em>this 200MP telephoto lens could debut, speculation placing it with the S26 Ultra could fit with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huge-samsung-megapixel-camera-production-rumor">several other camera rumors</a>. Old rumors claimed Samsung was working on producing the following larger ISOCELL sensors: 200MP (HP7), 50MP (GN6), and 440MP (HU1). Those rumors also speculated that Samsung was working on another 320MP sensor for its future generation of Ultra models.</p><p>Concerning the rumors, the publication notes how two popular Chinese brands have recently opted for 200MP telephoto lenses: Honor and Vivo. Specifically, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review#section-vivo-x100-ultra-cameras">Vivo X100 Ultra</a> utilizes a Samsung-made 200MP HP9 telephoto sensor with a 1/1.4-inch lens and 3.7x optical zoom capabilities. So, it seems that Samsung is familiar with such camera strength, but opting for a periscope will offer a little more zoom range.</p><p>Additionally, maybe we'll see this new periscope telephoto upgrade packaged with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-telephoto-camera-module-alop-detailed">Samsung's new ALoP camera tech</a>. The company stated it was developing a new piece of tech called ALoP or All Lenses on Prism, which is designed to deliver a more powerful camera experience while keeping the module slim. With Samsung seemingly more interested in thinner phones, this <em>might </em>be the future we're looking at.</p><p>Samsung stated the tech could accommodate a camera with an <em>f</em>/2.5 aperture on an 80mm lens. So, not only could its zoom increase, but so too could its ability to shoot in darker scenarios at night or indoors.</p><p>Whatever the case may be, facing our immediate future is the Galaxy S25 series, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">will debut tomorrow</a>, January 22. With only a day to go, check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">ultimate guide</a> to the new series to prepare.</p>
