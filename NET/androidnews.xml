But I need one all the same.</p><p>Most of the time, when we write about a great deal, it's because we think it's worth sharing; anyone who loves tech products knows they can be pricey, and we all want to save money. This time, I found one because I had to buy it for myself, and I'm going to grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D913TDZD/" target="_blank"><strong>Pixel Watch 3 from Amazon while it's on sale for $199</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">Garmin Venu 3</a> and I love it. It works fine, though it has its share of scratches and dings, but it's missing something I need to have: fall detection. Yes, like the woman who can't get up and needs a LifeAlert product, that kind of fall detection.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a1678fa3-c4c2-483e-9760-b459c6355951" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299" data-dimension48="$299" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D913TDZD/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="whBbwAg9hrdDn5WvWdWcTK" name="Google Pixel Watch 3" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/whBbwAg9hrdDn5WvWdWcTK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel Watch 3:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D913TDZD/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1W3KGJ2MZP5I0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.u8TZQk5kREH3WHiCcty7gV7loZLSyrpeBGpHHEPwVaFcfuPHTLHPp3-M6uL7NGH25NWG3g2R7SVQuo_p-om2E3qkx-3MJdUxNWe_KaabDtHvKAfejXozrFy6yMjw0CRe9_8OsqLxx799CxxI8ji-uGF-AIZC2K-alx_xwJL8Cuk436znGSOoeQq4qKrPVyzJj7COmCX6RHWNF0Z3ueH57Au3tpqC-KVybBrIsKIG_rM.NwgOmNjeZtY4WzB4Lcgq0DWvMnLW0PCxGeEPt8LDi3s&dib_tag=se&keywords=pixel%2Bwatch%2B3&qid=1762454175&sprefix=pixel%2Bwatch%2B3%2Caps%2C106&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1" target="_blank" data-dimension112="a1678fa3-c4c2-483e-9760-b459c6355951" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299" data-dimension48="$299" data-dimension25=""><del>$299</del> <strong>$199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday are only weeks away, but Amazon is selling what I need at a price I like.

Don't feel sorry for me because I did this to myself by being a dumbass, and I didn't die; life is generally good, and it forced me to grow up at 30 years old. I'm not paralyzed, though. As time goes by, severe damage to my bones and nerves is forcing me to live more of my life sitting down, but I can still walk a bit.</p><p>I'm also stubborn. My office is in the basement and I like having it in the basement. I have my "own" bathroom, easy access to the backyard, and it gives me privacy and peace while I'm trying to work. Getting to the basement is a different story because of the stairs. Stairs are my kryptonite, both up and down.</p><p>I only know if my legs are moving if I am looking at them. I can even step on a Lego and feel no pain. Legs that feel "dead" and stairs mean I fall down. A lot. So far, I've not broken anything or knocked myself out, but both my Doctor and my wife know that it could easily happen, and reluctantly, I even have to admit I could end up at the bottom of he steps, out cold and in need of help. I need something that can call for that help if I need it, but I'm not about to wear something marketed for senior citizens. I need a wearable with reliable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-explains-fall-detection">fall detection</a>, like the Pixel Watch 3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1278px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="rzj5VNuWbDsjj5ZWgmbNkT" name="Wheelchair-wheels-cropped.jpg" alt="Wheelchair wheels" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rzj5VNuWbDsjj5ZWgmbNkT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1278" height="718" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I know that the Pixel Watch 3 isn't the newest smartwatch from Google or the only wearable that offers fall detection. I also know that Black Friday and its mountain of tech sales are just a few weeks away.</p><p>I also know that if you need something, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-phone-frenzy-buy-now-or-bide-your-time">you should buy it when you see it at the right price</a> and have no regrets. I fell three times last week. I can't wait and don't want to do the smart thing and move my office upstairs.</p><p>I know my situation is different than most, but it's similar in some ways. When we have an immediate need, it's great when we can fill it and save a bunch of money. I'll miss the accuracy and battery life of my Garmin Venu 3, but I'm not going to complain about having a new shiny gadget to mess with.</p><p>And if I take a more serious tumble, I can get the help I need.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The RedMagic 11 Pro recently joined the list, bringing with it something that none of its rivals can offer: liquid cooling. Between the Gen 5's performance gains over last year's model, and RedMagic's focus on mobile gaming, needless to say that the phone will end up generating a bunch of heat.</p><p>Recently, Zack Nelson from JerryRigEverything got his hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic/redmagic-just-dropped-a-gaming-phone-with-a-literal-water-cooler-inside">RedMagic 11 Pro</a>, and put it through his gauntlet of torture tests. Unlike other phones that were recently released, the 11 Pro passed with flying colors. As for the results, the display begins to scratch at a level 6 on the Mohs scale, with "deeper grooves at a level 7."</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/826O9YGrGCg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>When holding a lighter to the screen, it took about 20 seconds or so to see that portion of the screen turn white. However, just a few moments later, and the AMOLED display "recovered," and you couldn't even tell where the burn initially occurred.</p><p>Nelson's bend tests are notorious for finding flaws with devices, as we recently saw with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-fold-smokes-up-and-explodes-during-jres-durability-test">Pixel 10 Pro Fold actually exploding</a>. RedMagic fans can rest easy, as the 11 Pro barely even flexed when pressure was applied to both the front and the back.</p><p>Moving onto the star of the show, Zack carefully removed the back glass that covers the entire rear of the phone, and few moments later, the entire liquid cooling loop was exposed. It wasn't until the phone was turned off and the loop was disconnected from the phone that it stopped entirely, which shouldn't come as much of a surprise.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4112px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jPCyFKsHWYDqw8Eky4QGof" name="redmagic-11-pro-jre-teardown-screen-burn" alt="Screen burn test on the RedMagic 11 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jPCyFKsHWYDqw8Eky4QGof.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4112" height="2314" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: JerryRigEverything)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's worth pointing out that when looking at the liquid cooling, you'll see some bubbles that aren't the same color as the blue liquid. Although we aren't sure as to the reason why this was done, it could just be for aesthetics otherwise the liquid cooling loop would just look blue all of the time.</p><p>Speaking of which, I have to agree with Zack here, as he's not sure why RedMagic didn't just have the majority of the loop shown. It makes the phone even more unique than it already is, and looks pretty darn cool at the same time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3198px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AayYrLzxUG3PpHpyJyHcye" name="redmagic-11-pro-liquid-cooling-teardown-jre-1" alt="Liquid cooling loop teardown on RedMagic 11 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AayYrLzxUG3PpHpyJyHcye.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3198" height="1799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: JerryRigEverything)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After finishing the disassembly of the RedMagic 11 Pro, Nelson manages to get everything put back together and turns the phone back on without any issues. While this isn't something that everyone should try to do, it's nice seeing how well-built these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming phones</a> really are. And if anything, it provides a bit of reassurance that your phone won't break under a bit of pressure or if you happen to drop it.</p><p>Pre-orders for the RedMagic 11 Pro are slated to kick off on November 13, with the base model priced at $749. For that, you'll get the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. However, you can also configure the phone with up to 24GB of RAM and a whopping 1TB of storage.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="bd1b30c5-033b-4448-ae36-a2f054257014">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGo9MTjPB4ZuTwds2Hp6ET.png' alt="back side of the RedMagic 11 Pro in silver"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">RedMagic 11 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Mobile gaming, embodied</strong></em></p><p>If you really want to see what the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 is capable of, especially with gaming, then the RedMagic 11 Pro is the phone for you.

However, we may have new information about the phone from the source itself. Samsung seems to have teased the Galaxy S26 during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-zuckerberg-predicts-when-ai-glasses-will-be-profitable">recent earnings call,</a> suggesting that it would feature an Exynos AP (mobile application processors) and use improved camera sensors. (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-spec-confirmation-q3-2025-earnings-3611552/">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>During the Q3 earnings call, Daniel Araujo, VP of Samsung’s mobile experience division, said that the Galaxy S26 lineup will “revolutionize the user experience with user-centric, next-gen AI, a second-generation custom AP, and stronger performance, including new camera sensors.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qyEYgwM83FhJcV4rxp47AZ" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of Galaxy S26 Pro leak showcasing a slimmer design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qyEYgwM83FhJcV4rxp47AZ.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This essentially means that the Galaxy S26 lineup will indeed have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-might-rock-the-exynos-2600-chip-but-only-in-this-region">Exynos 2600</a>, which was rumored to be the case at least in some regions, while the rest of the world might see the Snapdragon chipset specifically designed for Galaxy models, like its predecessor. Following up on the chipset question, Araujo said that “for the Galaxy S26, the AP (chipset) evaluation is still underway, so we can’t yet confirm our next year’s flagship lineup.”</p><p>Additionally, Araujo also hinted at possible hardware changes coming to the Galaxy S26 series, giving it new camera sensors this time around. Since the company has stuck to the same rear camera lenses since the Galaxy S22. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26#section-samsung-galaxy-s26-will-get-huge-imaging-upgrades">Previous leaks suggest</a> that the company plans to retain the 200MP HP9 primary camera.</p><p>However, it could also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-spec-confirmation-q3-2025-earnings-3611552/">incorporate a newer sensor</a> for the 3x zoom, which should enhance image quality. Both the primary and 5x cameras are also anticipated to benefit from a faster aperture, meaning better low-light images are in the books.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy S26 Ultra sensors debugged details:200MP HP250MP JN3 ultrawide12MP S5K3LD 3x tele50MP IMX854 peris 5x12MP IMX874 selfieOnly change this time is the traditional 10MP 3x 1/1.39 size sensor is replaced by newer 12MP K3LD.

According to the tipster, Samsung will supposedly use the same rear camera sensors on the S26 Ultra as the S25 Ultra. Only the 3x telephoto lens will get an upgrade to a 12MP S5K3LD sensor. That said, the rumor suggests that it could be the same size as the 10MP sensor, making for little to no change.</p><p>The S26 series is rumored to feature APV codec video recording, offering two modes: APV HQ and APV LQ. APV HQ will consume 1.5GB per minute of video, whereas APV LQ will use 750MB for the same duration.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.77%;"><img id="9RZcULZhDCDxmhACKyrKmW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9RZcULZhDCDxmhACKyrKmW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, it's no surprise that the next range of devices will come packed with Galaxy AI, and as Araujo mentioned, the next-gen AI could be even more intuitive, adapting to the users' needs. As we've seen in multiple leaks, One UI 8.5 is expected to heavily leverage AI, as the company is supposedly developing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-8-5-get-to-the-point-faster-ai-notification-summaries">"Notification Summaries," </a>Privacy display, offering presets for Pro camera controls, and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

On its way to "more than 60 markets" globally, Spotify says these stats will be accessible via your <strong>profile icon > listening stats</strong>. What you can expect is a weekly overview of "your top artists and songs from the past four weeks."</p><p>The platform states that aside from reliving what you've been jamming to, your listening stats will also deliver personalized highlights. These highlights will include listening milestones, fan moments, "a new discovery," and what makes your listening unique.</p><p>Though personal, Spotify says your weekly listening stats are shareable, too.</p><p>The entire week's stats or simply a condensed highlight can be shared with others through Spotify or in other apps, like Instagram and WhatsApp. The new Listening Stats will provide playlists inspired by your recent week's listening habits, as well as song suggestions that you might want to check. Users can look at listening stats as a miniature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-your-spotify-2020-wrapped-apple-music-replay-youtube-music-year-review">end-of-the-year Wrapped</a>, which Spotify itself alludes to.</p><p>Still, for those chunkier stats, you'll have to wait for the year's end for that colorful overview.</p><h2 id="stats-for-what-s-been-on-your-mind-2">Stats for what's been on your mind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="9F4k6fxnRwb5hkPJ9F6NQ7" name="spotify-weekly-listening-stats-overview" alt="Spotify's weekly "listening stats" shows the user what songs they've been hearing on repeat, as well as the dates the overview covers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9F4k6fxnRwb5hkPJ9F6NQ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Spotify's listening stats should start rolling out to Android devices soon, considering the announcement came late this week.

Now, for Premium users, you can text your song requests to the AI DJ, instead of speaking them aloud. This can be particularly useful when you're around other people or in loud, busy places. Additionally, the DJ will also display a few suggested prompts to get you started, if you're unsure of where to begin.</p><p>On the lines of AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-in-chatgpt-android-create-entire-playlists-without-lifting-a-finger">Spotify and ChatGPT got together</a>, giving users the choice of merging their accounts, so the AI can play songs for them. Users conversing with ChatGPT can ask the AI to find a specific song from their favorite artists through weekly playlists like Discover Weekly or New Music Friday.

Getting it there is only half the battle, though, because once you've received it, the way it appears can make all the difference. We've all seen websites that have a different layout or format based on the device you're using (you're on one right now!), but what makes it work? Are you tagged and tracked across the internet so that everyone with a web presence knows whether you're using a phone or a laptop?</p><p>Thankfully, no. It's a complicated process made simple for the people building the browser by placing all the work on the web host, called a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/win7appqual/user-agent-string" target="_blank">User Agent String</a>.</p><p>Every bit of software capable of perusing the contents of a website has a UAS. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whats-your-favorite-web-browser-2020">web browser</a> you are using right now has one, AI content scrapers have one, and even some web browser extensions have one. They offer it to the web page when it's requested, so the web page knows what to send back.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="vQT3SZsmGNc2Vnnuj4gizh" name="Google-Search-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Google Search on HP Chromebase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vQT3SZsmGNc2Vnnuj4gizh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2252" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/141.0.0.0 Safari/537.36</strong></p><p>That's my own UAS as I'm writing this. You can find yours simply by opening Google Search and asking, "<em>What is my user agent string?"</em> and it will tell you because it asks your browser, and your browser tells it — the same process as any other website.</p><p>This, along with other information like screen dimension, the number of colors your graphics adapter and display can render, and any requested language support (this is also stored and kept ready to send if needed), is what turns a bunch of code into what you see once the browser on your device gets something it can use to create it. Yes, your web browser is building the website from internet addresses and strings of code.</p><p>This sounds awfully confusing, and it certainly can be. That's why the workload is somewhat divided. A web browser installed on a device, regardless of its type, has plenty to do when it receives the raw data to build something coherent out of. However, it must retrieve the correct data, as different browsers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-latest-speedometer-3-test-smashes-old-records" target="_blank">construct web pages in distinct</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-latest-speedometer-3-test-smashes-old-records"> ways</a>.</p><p>A website has plenty to do, ensuring that different versions of the layout, image sizes, colors, and fonts are rendered correctly by your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-vp-criticizes-apple-dma-browser-changes" target="_blank">browser's engine</a>, but it must know <em>what</em> to send.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:517px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.03%;"><img id="eVi3m6km8VmWTyMUbKwVCd" name="google-cloud-ai.png" alt="Google Cloud Tensor Processing Units" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eVi3m6km8VmWTyMUbKwVCd.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="517" height="300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The process:</p><p>A device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phone in your hand</a> visits a site on the internet by a complex (and a whole different article's worth of complications) series of routing until a connection between your browser and the web server is established.</p><p>The web server queries the browser, asking about the type of device, its capabilities, the display size, and the number of colors the device can render, among other details.</p><p>The web browser has this information readily available in a convenient and persistent manner. It sends a few lines of text back with minimal effort because it's already there, ready to go.</p><p>The web server takes this information and decides what version of the website to send back, and you get to see it.</p><p>Thankfully, the best part of the whole process is the fact that we don't have to do anything. We can click on a link and see what we were hoping to see. It's perfectly safe, has nothing to do with sending any sort of personal information or tracking you across the web, and it honestly does "just work."</p><h2 id="abusing-the-process-2">Abusing the process</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="g4Q8xJWPsVq4ErZUgk9b5P" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gen-5-keynote-AI-everywhere" alt="Cristiano Amon on stage with "AI everywhere" behind him" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g4Q8xJWPsVq4ErZUgk9b5P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2900" height="1631" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, this is easily abused by web publishers. I won't tell you how to change the UAS of your device because it's an easy way to break stuff, but it's not hard to do. A web server can't look through a hidden camera and verify that it's receiving the correct information, so it accepts what it's told. It has to, if anything is going to work.</p><p>You probably guessed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-ai-phones">AI is involved</a> in this abuse, because welcome to 2025. And it's somewhat disheartening to see what companies are doing; it has the potential to make a complicated process that has required a lot of work seamless and fast, and forcing it to change.</p><p>I'll use the most recent example I can think of, but we can assume that <em>every</em> company scraping the web for content to feed its AI does the same thing. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-explores-perplexity-ai-integration-to-rival-gemini-on-galaxy-s26-series">Perplexity</a>, a relatively new entrant to the AI scene, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/718319/perplexity-stealth-crawling-cloudflare-ai-bots-report" target="_blank">was caught experimenting with various UASs and disregarding requests about its capabilities</a>, allowing it to "steal" content from websites and use it without any form of agreement.</p><p>Most websites have a policy about what an AI scraper can and can't use for free, and pretending to be something else allowed Perplexity's scraper to access things it wasn't supposed to access.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="STiUuZUb3pRGJkbPFexEe4" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-25" alt="Perplexity on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/STiUuZUb3pRGJkbPFexEe4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No matter how you feel about AI "stealing" content or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/googles-ai-overviews-in-search-might-kill-publishing-and-its-going-to-backfire-eventually">web publishers</a>, anything that could disrupt something that works so well is troubling.

This is a small line of text that your web browser (such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) automatically sends to the website/web server with every request. It contains information about the browser you're using to view the site, the operating system, and the device you're using, so that it can render the correct version of the website suitable for your screen.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What kind of information can web servers receive about your device from the User-Agent string?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p><strong>Screen resolution/Viewport size:</strong> By checking the height and width of your browser window, the website can infer if it's running on a small phone, a tablet, or a large desktop monitor. This is key to <strong>responsive design</strong>.</p><p><strong>Touch Capabilities:</strong> Checking if the device has a touch screen can help distinguish between mobile and desktop devices.</p><p><strong>Hardware and software capabilities:</strong> Less common methods include checking for specific browser APIs, CPU architecture, and other hardware details to further refine the device profile.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Can a website be wrong about the type of device or browser I’m using?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Yes, device detection is not always 100% accurate. Accuracy can be compromised for a few reasons:</p><p><strong>Spoofing:</strong> Users can deliberately change (spoof) their User-Agent string to make the website believe they are using a different device or browser.</p><p><strong>Outdated databases:</strong> Some websites rely on external databases to map a User-Agent string to a device. If these databases aren't updated, they may misidentify new devices.</p><p><strong>Security/privacy tools:</strong> Some browser extensions or VPNs may obscure or modify the data sent to the website.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Why is it important for a website to know what device I’m on?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>A website needs this information to deliver the best user experience possible.

As with most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a>, there's a good bit of fine print involved, so let's break it all down. </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="0d3ad032-b699-4ccc-acd8-46d5eb9a58bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon" data-dimension48="Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon" href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100048248-17161891?sid=hawk-custom-tracking" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="bGnN5XZnLzieRfbffhXSLD" name="verizon-2024-logo-sq.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bGnN5XZnLzieRfbffhXSLD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="426" height="426" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100048248-17161891?sid=hawk-custom-tracking" data-dimension112="0d3ad032-b699-4ccc-acd8-46d5eb9a58bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label='Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon' data-dimension48='Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon' data-dimension25=""><strong>Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon</strong></a></p><p>Join Verizon 5G Home Internet with the 5G Home Ultimate plan and you'll get to choose between a free QLED Samsung TV, Nintendo Switch gaming console, or the powerful Galaxy Tab S10 FE tablet. </p><p>Verizon 5G Home Internet plans also let you choose between a number of excellent perks for $10 per month, including a popular streaming bundle that consists of Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus. Happy holidays, indeed. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100048248-17161891?sid=hawk-custom-tracking" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="0d3ad032-b699-4ccc-acd8-46d5eb9a58bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon" data-dimension48="Get a FREE Samsung 43" QLED TV, Nintendo Switch, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE with the 5G Home Ultimate plan at Verizon" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>For starters, it's important to know what Verizon 5G Home Internet actually <em>is. </em></p><p>Unlike traditional providers that use cable or fiber optic technology to offer fast internet access, Verizon 5G Home Internet utilizes its own ultrawideband cellular network - the same 5G network that you access with your smartphone. The advantage is that 5G Home Internet is affordable, easy to install, and if you live in an area with good 5G coverage, just as fast as traditional broadband. </p><p>Verizon's 5G Home Ultimate plan is the best that the internet provider has to offer, giving customers unlimited premium data, Ultra HD 4K streaming, and a free Wi-Fi extender to cover your entire home. You'll also get a five-year price lock, 30-day money-back guarantee, and no hidden fees or confusing setup costs. </p><p>And of course, like Verizon's best wireless plans, you get to mix and match entertainment perks every month for $10 apiece. These benefits range from unlimited cloud storage to streaming services, including the Disney Plus Bundle. That means you're getting Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus for 50% off its usual cost, so if you're missing out on live sports following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tv-disney-stalemate-continues-as-neither-side-agrees-to-end-the-blackout">the YouTube TV/Disney Plus fallout</a>, now's your chance to enjoy all of the action for cheap. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1116px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xpaiD26Mm37GnjCSnTdRq3" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-playing-games-lifestyle" alt="Lifestyle image of someone playing games on the Galaxy Tab S10 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xpaiD26Mm37GnjCSnTdRq3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1116" height="628" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sure, the perks here are nice, but the Verizon 5G Home Internet deal's biggest selling point is the free gift. The options include a 43-inch Samsung Q7F QLED TV (a $399.99 value), a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE</a> tablet ($599.99), or a Nintendo Switch ($339.99). All you need to do is sign up for the aforementioned 5G Home Ultimate plan and use it for six months without missing a payment or cancelling the service.</p><p>Verizon's 5G Home Ultimate plan starts at $85 per month, but you can easily drop the price down to $60 per month by using AutoPay and bundling your internet service with one of Verizon's wireless plans. Members who bundle internet with mobile service will also get a complimentary perk, which means you might get the Disney Plus Bundle for completely free. </p><p>This deal may not be for everyone, but if you live in an area with good 5G access and you're looking to switch internet providers anyway, this is a great way to do it AND get some discounted (or free) entertainment out of the deal. With the holidays swiftly approaching, that's just the kind of break I need. </p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Then we've got the podcast for you! I sat down with 9to5Google's Will Sattelberg this past week to discuss the launch of Android XR, the Galaxy XR, and everything those products mean for the future of XR on the November 3, 2025 edition of The Sideload podcast.</p><p>When Will asked me to be a guest on the show, I knew there was no way I could turn it down. We've been covering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Samsung Galaxy XR</a> in depth at Android Central since before the launch, getting our hands on the elusive headset three times before it went to retail.</p><p>I also write a weekly XR-centric column called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">AC thVRsday</a> that goes live on, you guessed it, Thursdays. If you're not familiar with the term XR, it stands for eXtended Reality and covers the gamut of AR and VR devices. That's everything from smart glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a> to full-fledged, premium VR headsets like Samsung's newly launched Galaxy XR.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdLcfdKHUPc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>If you're looking for something specific, Will was kind enough to list out the timestamps for all the major topics:</p><ul><li>00:00:00 – Intro</li><li>00:01:02 – Nick’s VR experience</li><li>00:10:04 – Galaxy VR</li><li>00:23:20 – Samsung’s current-gen rivals</li><li>00:35:32 – Where VR excels</li><li>00:48:03 – Smart glasses</li><li>01:06:48 – Laser Dance</li><li>01:11:16 – Wrap-up</li></ul><p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> is a brand new version of Android built specifically for XR devices, and while the Galaxy XR mixed reality headset is the first Android XR device to market, we're expecting a treasure trove of smart glasses to use the operating system next year.</p><p>That includes companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-we-want-to-see-from-samsung-android-xr-glasses">like Samsung</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-android-xr-glasses-project-aura-meta-orion-similar">Xreal</a>, who are expected to debut a wide range of products including display-less AI glasses and even full-fledged AR glasses.

Plus, it comes with a built-in LED flashlight, topographical map information, and sports and activity profiles for a wide range of sports such as soccer, baseball, football, volleyball and more.</p><p>To be sure, it stands up to many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-and-fitness-trackers-gps">best GPS smartwatches and fitness trackers</a> on the market, and while the price point is normally a deterrent, it starts to seem highly competitive at just $619.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Garmin-epix-Pro-Gen-2-51mm-High-Performance-Smartwatch-Advanced-Training-Technology-Built-in-Flashlight-Black/3253998041" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fgQAnsurLEHrTe4Qw8DLiM" name="garmin epix pro gen 2 reco 600x600.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fgQAnsurLEHrTe4Qw8DLiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Garmin Epix Pro (Gen 2):</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Garmin-epix-Pro-Gen-2-51mm-High-Performance-Smartwatch-Advanced-Training-Technology-Built-in-Flashlight-Black/3253998041" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$999.99</del> <strong>$619.99 at Walmart</strong></a></p><p>With <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday still weeks away, Walmart has launched a $380 discount on the second-gen Garmin Epix Pro smartwatch.

To catch up, Apple seems ready to use a solution from an unexpected source: Google.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/apple-plans-to-use-1-2-trillion-parameter-google-gemini-model-to-power-new-siri" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> report says Apple is about to sign a deal to pay around $1 billion each year for a custom version of Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> model. This model has about 1.2 trillion parameters, while Apple’s current model has about 150 billion.</p><p>Apple reportedly plans to run this Gemini-based model on its own Private Cloud Compute servers. This means Google supplies the model, while Apple keeps it behind its own walls to preserve its privacy narrative. The revamped Siri is expected to roll out in spring 2026, possibly as part of iOS 26.4.</p><p>This move also shows that Apple recognizes its AI models are not yet ready. Earlier this year, Apple looked at other AI partners, such as OpenAI and Anthropic, before choosing Google. The deal does not mean Google’s search engine or brand will appear in Apple’s interface; most of the integration will happen in the background.</p><h2 id="temporary-boost-2">Temporary boost</h2><p>For Apple, this is a smart temporary solution. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-needs-google-now-more-than-ever">gets access to a powerful model now</a> while it works on its own future AI. The report says Apple is developing its own cloud-based model with about 1 trillion parameters.</p><p>However, there are caveats. The agreement isn’t fully public yet, so details might change. And while more parameters usually mean stronger models, user experience depends on a lot more than just size — datasets, latency, privacy, integration all matter. Also, Apple has had AI-feature delays before.</p><p>If the deal pans out, Siri <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-should-ditch-siri-for-gemini-and-google-cloud-heres-why">could become much more capable</a> by spring 2026, thanks to Google’s AI. The $1 billion per year price may make heads turn, but since Apple is catching up in AI, paying for access makes sense right now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I've found that it tends to use about 15% of its power in eight "normal" hours, and even less at night. I'll typically end up with 10–15% power after 48 hours.</p><p>You'll use apps like Gemini that eat up that extra power, but it's nice to see how efficiently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> runs, combined with the more efficient <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a> chip.</p><p>Equally important, the Pixel Watch 4 recharges absurdly fast thanks to the new Quick Charge Dock. Google estimates it'll take an hour to recharge the Watch 4 45mm, and it's typically much quicker unless you're charging it from a completely dead battery. For example, I plugged it in at 9% power, and it took 42 minutes to hit 100%.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-the-pixel-watch-4-45mm-for-extra-battery-life-2">Should you buy the Pixel Watch 4 45mm for extra battery life?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3895px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xxECTZggiFniCMYYhC5Prb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-colors-and-sizes-2" alt="Three Pixel Watch 4 models next to each other in different colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xxECTZggiFniCMYYhC5Prb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3895" height="2191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch 4 45mm isn't as long-lasting as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, but it's more comfortable than either of those bulky models.

No, that's not because I <em>love </em>using iPhones — quite the opposite, really. It was because I couldn't wait to test out the spatial photo and video capture that comes built-in to the phone's camera app.</p><p>You see, when Apple launched the Vision Pro in 2024, it understood that most people with a Vision Pro wouldn't wear them on their heads 24/7 and, therefore, wouldn't use its powerful spatial cameras to capture everyday memories. That type of experience is reserved for the phones in our pockets, and recent iPhone models can capture this kind of content.</p><p>On the Android side of things, the only way to capture spatial photos or video is to buy an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreals-new-ar-glass-companion-brings-android-apps-to-life-in-3d">Xreal Beam Pro</a>. This neat little gadget is perfect when paired with a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> glasses, and it's also perfect for capturing spatial photos and video of any kind throughout your day. The obvious problem is that it's a second device you'd have to remember to charge and take with you at all times, and that's just not realistic for most people.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

At the very least, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-3d-capture-shows-up-xr-headset-we-dont-have-yet">introduced a hidden feature</a> in its Camera Assistant app that lets you capture 3D pictures and video specifically for Galaxy XR, but I don't understand why Samsung wants to hide it so badly. This should be a standard mode or feature on <em>all</em> Samsung phones.</p><p>The worst part is that Samsung has already one-upped Apple by offering users high-quality selections for 3D video and photos. Even better, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> can capture 4K spatial video, while even the mighty iPhone 17 Pro Max tops out at 1080p. Again, why hide such a fantastic feature? I just don't get it.</p><p>The images I captured using this feature on a Galaxy S25 Ultra upload just fine to the Meta Quest app, but videos aren't selectable at all yet. That one's on Meta, but it still shows that Android users have to jump through unnecessary hoops to get a second-rate experience compared to how things are on an iPhone, and I <strong>hate</strong> that.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You can find it by tapping your profile icon > Gift Cards, or by simply searching for “gift cards” in the app. From there, users can browse through available brands, select an amount, personalize the message, and send the card straight to someone’s email address or phone number.</p><p>According to Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/16585331" target="_blank">support page</a>, most cards are delivered within an hour, though in some cases it can take up to 24 hours.</p><p>The move makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play-download-manage-apps">Play Store</a> a more flexible digital gifting hub. While users have long been able to buy Google Play balance cards, this new rollout adds third-party brand cards to the mix, meaning you can send a Starbucks or Disney gift card as easily as topping up your Play Store credits.</p><h2 id="strict-regional-and-usage-limits-apply-2">Strict regional and usage limits apply</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PwTCf9vyKJxtkDf6YBFTF7" name="Google-Play-Store-hero-AC.jpg" alt="Google Play Store homepage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PwTCf9vyKJxtkDf6YBFTF7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, the feature comes with clear boundaries. For one, gift cards can’t be used across countries. So, a U.S.-bought card, for instance, won’t work if you try to redeem it in another region. Likewise, Google strictly prohibits reselling, trading, or converting gift cards to cash.</p><p>Also, these cards can’t be used to buy other gift cards or for business purposes. These limitations are in place to prevent misuse and fraud.</p><p>When it comes to buying, Google outlines some key details on its official support page. Digital gift cards can be purchased directly from the Play Store, but users can’t use their existing Play balance or Play Points to pay for them, and buying them doesn’t earn you extra Play Points either.</p><p>Each country also has its own purchase limit of around $250 per day in the U.S., £250 in the U.K., and roughly MXN $5,000 in Mexico. If you receive a digital card, you can redeem it by following the link sent to you via email or SMS. Cards from outside Google Play (such as Starbucks or Adidas) must be redeemed according to each brand’s specific instructions.</p><p>Google is also reminding users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-flags-new-wave-of-online-scams-fueled-by-ai-fakes-and-holiday-hustles">stay alert to gift card scams</a>, a common problem in which bad actors pose as legitimate companies or individuals and request payment via gift cards.</p><p>The company stresses one simple rule: if someone asks you to pay them with a Google Play gift card, it’s a scam. Google doesn’t ask for gift cards as payment for any product or service, and users are advised never to share their redemption codes with anyone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A recent Google advisory explains how these criminals are working right now.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/fraud-and-scams-advisory-november-2025/" target="_blank">advisory</a>, scammers are upgrading their playbook using AI tools to make their tricks look painfully real. From fake job listings to malicious VPN apps, the scams are multiplying fast and preying on anyone who lets their guard down online.</p><p>Google highlights fake job offers as a major trend. Scammers pretend to be big companies by copying their career pages, posing as recruiters, and posting fake government jobs. Google says they often ask for “processing fees” or get people to download fake interview software that steals information. Remember, real employers never ask for money or banking details before hiring.</p><p>Business owners aren’t off the hook either. A newer scam making waves involves “review extortion,” where attackers flood a business with one-star reviews and then demand money to remove them.</p><p>Google provides a direct way for merchants to report these extortion attempts straight from their profiles.</p><h2 id="ai-impersonation-scams-are-on-the-rise-2">AI impersonation scams are on the rise</h2><p>Then there’s the booming category of AI impersonation scams. Fraudsters are faking websites and apps pretending to be “exclusive” or “free” versions of popular AI tools. The endgame is always the same — install malware, steal credentials, or push overpriced “fleeceware” subscriptions.</p><p>Google says its AI-powered Safe Browsing and Play Store policies are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-says-android-phones-block-more-scams-than-iphones">catching many of these</a>, but users should still double-check URLs and only download from official sources.</p><p>Other warnings include malicious VPN apps disguised as privacy tools but actually loaded with malware, fraud recovery scams targeting people who’ve already been scammed, and holiday shopping scams that ramp up during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-amazon-deals-2025">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday with fake storefronts and “too-good-to-be-true” deals.</p><p>Google’s Trust & Safety team says scammers are becoming quicker, smarter, and more widespread, but defenses are improving too. With real-time scam detection in Google Messages and Gmail, plus better AI-based browser protections, the company hopes these tools can protect users before they get hurt.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-32">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>AYANEO provided its first look at the Pocket Vert, an upcoming Game Boy-styled handheld.</li><li>It also shared a few specs, such as the 3.5-inch LCD display, with a 1600 x 1440 resolution.</li><li>There are still a few details left unknown, but AYANEO promises more will be "revealed soon."</li></ul><p>The fun never stops for AYANEO, as just last week, the company's first smartphone was teased, and now there's another new handheld being shown off. We first heard about the AYANEO Pocket Vert <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gpBmFdgeYJ8?si=9xkD4C64N4UJske_">back in July</a> during the company's "Strategy Sharing Session" livestream. Now, we're getting our first look at the handheld, along with a few other key details.</p><p>The Pocket Vert will be AYANEO's first vertical handheld to be released since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-dmg-pocket-micro-launch">Pocket DMG</a>, which arrived in 2023. Since its release, the DMG quickly became a favorite in the community, even with its higher asking price. AYANEO is hoping to recapture some of that magic with the Vert, but in a completely different way.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VlfPHwsNrnY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>What made the Pocket DMG so enticing was its clear homage to the original Game Boy, especially with the Retro Power color. Not only that, but the DMG is powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, giving you flagship gaming power in a vertical-styled handheld, which is something we never thought we'd see.</p><p>With the Pocket Vert, AYANEO is taking a slightly different course of action, focusing on a refined and ultra-premium design. AYANEO is ditching the plastic in favor of a "CNC-milled Unibody," complete with what it's calling "Diamond-cut shoulder buttons."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yHPHZeaL3W5ovDJHwYcTud" name="ayaneo-pocket-vert-diamond-cut-rear-buttons-1" alt="Close-up on "Diamond Cut Shoulder Buttons" on the AYANEO Pocket Vert" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yHPHZeaL3W5ovDJHwYcTud.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, the aluminum build and "diamond-like" buttons aren't the only reason why the Pocket Vert stands out. The 3.5-inch IPS display might just be the sharpest display we've ever seen on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android device</a>. The panel features a 1600 x 1440 resolution, equating to a 615 PPI. This also means that you'll be able to play original Game Boy games at a 10x pixel perfect resolution.</p><p>Since AYANEO's video gave us a look at the entire design, there's no denying that it's definitely going to stand out. Unlike the Pocket DMG which featured one joystick and then a "touchpad," you'll find no such thing on the Pocket Vert.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.72%;"><img id="5uWqoTuUYvHzytXbSevZtd" name="ayaneo-pocket-vert-front-render" alt="AYANEO Pocket Vert render of the front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5uWqoTuUYvHzytXbSevZtd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2584" height="1724" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is probably due to the aluminum build, but all we have are the standard ABXY and D-Pad buttons along with, presumably, Start and Select. There is a third, longer, button at the bottom, but that's likely just going to be a way to quickly bring up the AYASpace software.</p><p>There are still plenty of unanswered questions about the Pocket Vert, such as what kind of chip will be used. Perhaps more importantly, we have no idea how much this handheld is going to cost.</p><p>AYANEO has traditionally been on the more expensive side when it comes to gaming handhelds, and only recently did it open pre-orders for its first sub-$100 device with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/im-shocked-at-how-cheap-this-premium-android-gaming-handheld-is">Pocket AIR Mini</a>. However, with a CNC aluminum unibody design and a 1440p screen, we wouldn't be surprised to see this priced between $200 and $300, at least.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="bd1b30c5-033b-4448-ae36-a2f054257014">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AYA-NEO-Pocket-DMG-Snapdragon/dp/B0DX7G3366/" data-model-name="AYANEO Pocket DMG" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LgvzmDueFp6kLQ3b4jr32X.jpg' alt="AYANEO Pocket DMG Square Render"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">AYANEO Pocket DMG</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Game Boy on steroids</strong></em></p><p>If you're on the hunt for a Game Boy DMG-styled handheld running Android, there's nothing better than the AYANEO Pocket DMG.

This feature was previously only available on individual Nintendo systems that reported these statistics, but now you can find <em>all</em> your play history stats in one convenient place!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.02%;"><img id="PwyjBzYTSTJXiu77q4TjWj" name="nintendo-shop-app-play-history" alt="Finding the Play Activity section in the Nintendo Shop Android app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PwyjBzYTSTJXiu77q4TjWj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1352" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To find your play history, open the app, navigate to the profile tab in the bottom right, then select Play Activity at the bottom of the user page.

Per the report, the company's Mobile eXperience division (MX) is putting its foot down by saying it is targeting an "annual sales target" of 35 million units for the Galaxy S26 series in 2026.</p><p>It appears that Samsung is quite confident in its S26 series, though the report doesn't break down how many units per model it expects to sell (the Ultra's probably up there, if anything). However, what the report does expand on is revenue, which could reportedly climb to roughly $90.7 billion (~130 trillion won).</p><p>This revenue expectation (or hope) is reportedly being seen as a "meaningful growth" if Samsung can hit it next year. The company is not only looking at its S26 series to carry it, but also its 2026 foldable line.</p><p>Samsung is reportedly looking to sell roughly 5 million foldable units, a number that will likely span the next Galaxy Z Flip and Fold combined. We'll have to see if the next Fold outshines the Flip next year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-is-so-popular-samsung-scrambling-for-more">like it did earlier this year</a>.</p><h2 id="already-looking-to-the-new-year-2">Already looking to the new year</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rumors about the Galaxy S26 series have been trickling in, especially a recent report <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-ultra-s-pen-might-ditch-the-boxy-look-for-softer-curves">about its Ultra model's S Pen</a>. It's been speculated that the next S Pen could drop its boxy appearance for something a little softer. Those flat edges may disappear, as Samsung could dip into a "curvier" design for its S26 Ultra S Pen. As far as theories go, there's nothing just yet about new features.</p><p>Moreover, rumors claim that the S26 Ultra could be the end of an era, as Samsung may not return the S Pen again. The device, since it slots into the device, gets in the way of its battery and hardware specifications.</p><p>When it comes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-locked-in-the-galaxy-s26-launch-date">to <em>when </em>we could see</a> the Galaxy S26 series debut, rumors have varied, but one report seems confident. It's not been rumored that the series could pop up on February 25, 2026, during Samsung's Unpacked event in San Francisco, California. Supposedly, the event is eyeing San Francisco due to its close ties to AI software. Additionally, the rumors are back to suggesting the series could feature a base model, an S26 Plus, and an S26 Ultra (no Pro or Edge).</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, it appears the ongoing issue resulted in subscribers missing both the football game on ESPN and the election day coverage on November 4 on ABC.</p><p>The two streaming giants are currently at odds, leaving fans frustrated and angry as they are caught in the midst of this rift. To give you a quick rundown of what the situation looks like right now, Disney recently asked that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a> restore access to ABC just for a day.</p><p>Google denied that request with a public <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/our-response-to-disneys-request-to-restore-abc/" target="_blank">statement</a>, saying that Disney's proposal would "cause customer confusion" since the channel would disappear after that.</p><p>But, Google proposed that Disney restore both ABC and ESPN indefinitely for its users while the negotiations continue between the two. Following the removal of these channels from YouTube TV, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-is-giving-users-usd10-credit">Google started issuing credits</a> to subscribers as compensation.</p><h2 id="subscribers-miss-out-on-key-sports-and-election-coverage-2">Subscribers miss out on key sports and election coverage</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Xif26sGTzKHR2qnnicfKfZ" name="YouTube-TV-logo" alt="YouTube TV logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xif26sGTzKHR2qnnicfKfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Users took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/1omidwp/youtube_tv_says_disney_unnecessarily_aggressive/">Reddit</a> to vent, filled with disappointment and uncertainty, and one of them stated that they're extremely unhappy with the way things have been playing out.</p><p>"Disney wants to funnel any viewers who want to watch CBB/CFB to ESPN+/Fubo/Hulu, and now I can't watch football this weekend, and if they don't figure out the contract dispute by early next week, I won't be able to watch UK's season opener.

However, it appears that, in true AI fashion, Google is looking to replace this dictionary box with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-year-later-research-report">AI overviews</a>.</p><p>As spotted by some users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1n7ntqa/word_definitions_gone_and_replaced_by_ai_im_pissed/">Reddit</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techissuestoday.com/google-ai-overviews-word-definitions/">TechIssuesToday</a>), Google seems to be testing this change for select users.

According to DirecTV, consumers left in the dark by YouTube TV's ongoing negotiations can hop into its "Genre Packs." With this pack, it states viewers will find access to shows like <em>Dancing with the Stars </em>and major sports events, like college basketball.</p><p>Vince Torres, chief marketing officer at DIRECTV, states, "With options for free TV, specialized Genre Packs, and comprehensive streaming solutions all on our new and improved experience, DIRECTV makes it easy for consumers to watch what they want, how they want, and when they want. Consumers are taking notice and value our new, reliable, and simple streaming experience."</p><p>Torres also states that DirecTV provides a simple, single platform for viewers just looking to watch what they want. Viewers can do this easily, as DirecTV breaks things down into three important categories: MySports, MyNews, and MyEntertainment. Each one focuses on your favorite sports, elections, world news, and the most popular shows on the air.</p><p>DirecTV highlights its "five-day risk-free trial," which makes it easy for consumers who want to see if the service is worth keeping around.</p><h2 id="directv-shows-up-with-the-content-2">DirecTV shows up with the content</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Xif26sGTzKHR2qnnicfKfZ" name="YouTube-TV-logo" alt="YouTube TV logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xif26sGTzKHR2qnnicfKfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>DirecTV was making headlines late in October, as it partnered with Google TV to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-reportedly-heads-for-hotels-with-directv-and-a-fully-customized-look">completely revamp and revitalize TV</a> in hotels. DirecTV wants to bring its new "Advanced Entertainment Platform" (AEP) to hotel rooms, a customizable platform that lets hotels tailor it to their needs. Google TV serves as the backbone to this, bringing the streaming services and apps that visitors will seek to tune into.</p><p>More importantly, users can even sign into their hotel TV with their Google account to access their shows. The post states that their information will be wiped to ensure their privacy remains secure.</p><p>As far as the YouTube TV angle goes, Disney's content was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/youtube-tv-may-lose-espn-abc-as-disney-delivers-a-stern-warning">on the verge of a total blackout</a> for the former's viewers late last month. The deadline loomed heavy, as viewers were at risk of losing out on nearly a dozen of Disney's channels, including ABC and ESPN. At the time, YouTube TV claimed that Disney's proposition during the negotiations could force it to "raise prices" for consumers. Fingers were quickly pointed the opposite way, as Disney said YouTube TV was "exploiting its position at the expense of their own customers."</p><p>When both sides <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/disney-channels-disappear-from-youtube-tv-as-the-sides-fail-to-reach-deal">failed to reach an agreement</a>, those channels swiftly disappeared. Now, we're completely locked in a stalemate as neither side is willing to budge just yet on a way to return those channels to consumers. The finger-pointing continues; however, as YouTube TV claims Disney has been "unnecessarily aggressive and assertive.' Disney says the opposite, claiming that YouTube TV has blown the situation out of proportion.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are a handful of major updates that users can prepare to witness, starting with real-world landmarks when navigating their travels. The post states that, instead of just going off "turn left in 500 ft," or stop signs and traffic lights, Gemini brings forth more noticeable buildings, like gas stations.</p><p>With that, Google states Maps will inform you to "turn right" at the gas station up ahead or, perhaps, it'll name the nearest restaurant, so you're better informed on when to turn. This "landmark-based" navigation is rolling out to Android and iOS devices today (Nov 5).</p><p>To help you along in your navigation, Google Maps now leans on Gemini for proactive traffic alerts. If there are traffic jams, crashes, or anything that would impede any future travels, Maps will now send you a notification about it. Google states that these alerts can come through "even if you’re not actively navigating," so keep that in mind as these alerts roll out on Android and iOS today.</p><h2 id="gemini-arrives-for-navigation-2">Gemini arrives for navigation</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:484px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:123.97%;"><img id="KsdD8s5GwaQBMNnGacBM9V" name="google-maps-gemini-lens-update-coming-soon" alt="Gemini is headed for Google Maps with Lens in tow, helping users understand the establishments they visit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KsdD8s5GwaQBMNnGacBM9V.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="484" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:401px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:149.63%;"><img id="peHuQBkXdCM7wxMDULdr8V" name="google-maps-gemini-proactive-alerts-update" alt="Google Maps will soon deliver "proactive" updates about traffic jams, crashes, and more as a pop-up notification on Android and iOS." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/peHuQBkXdCM7wxMDULdr8V.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="401" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Gemini is, of course, a little more than a preemptive alert or navigational assistor, as the post highlights the inclusion of Lens and multi-step tasks. Regarding the former, Google Maps now has Lens built in with Gemini at its core. Users arriving at a restaurant can open Lens and ask about the establishment. When centered in the viewfinder, Google Maps' classic pin with the spots name will appear.</p><p>Users can voice their query or type it, and let Gemini explain "what's so popular" about the place they're at. Google teases that Gemini can also let you know if a local spot carries something particular you're looking for.</p><p>On the flip side, for multi-step tasks, Gemini can satisfy queries for something "budget-friendly" that also has "vegan options." Users can then lock in whatever destination Gemini and Google Maps produce, simplifying the navigation process to what feels like just a regular conversation. Moreover, Google says users can grant Gemini in Maps access to their Calendar.</p><p>If granted, the AI can throw in new events for you. Now, not all of this is available right away, as Google says Gemini's Lens capabilities in Maps will "roll out gradually later this month" for U.S. users in Android and iOS. Additionally, Gemini in navigation will soon hit Android and iOS devices "in the coming weeks," with an expected arrival on Android Auto in the future.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>Once upon a time, e-readers were mainly made by bookstore companies hoping you'd continue to peruse their shelves regularly, even if that's just in digital fashion. These days, brands like Onyx Boox and Bigme have made a name for themselves by making E Ink devices powered by Android, ensuring that you can do more on an e-reader than you ever thought possible.</p><p>This year, we've seen an explosion of color e-readers, as the E Ink Kaleido 3 has become more popular, and Bigme has been releasing new devices at a rapid pace since the spring. I find myself cycling between three of the company's best color e-readers depending on what I find myself reading, but it's unlikely that most people want two or three e-readers lying around the house.</p><p>So that begs the question: what kind of reader are you? Do you enjoy novels and fan fiction? Maybe you prefer graphic novels with a visual twist? How about binging manga series on a perfectly illuminated slab of e-paper? Or maybe you just want an e-ink tablet that's great for writing on, so you can publish your own stories someday. I've got three different-sized Bigme color e-readers here, and I'll help narrow down the best one for you.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

I'm certainly guilty of falling prey to the desire to live as minimally as possible at times, and fitting hundreds of books into a device that's only slightly larger than my phone is a very attractive idea.</p><p>That's where the Bigme B6 comes in. As the name implies, this one packs a 6-inch color E Ink Kaleido 3 display behind a slightly chunky frame. Aside from the size, the unique physical aspect here is the row of 5 capacitive keys at the bottom. I would prefer physical buttons over capacitive ones, but this is an interesting hook nonetheless.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xuJVCax6rFDR7rCfYpTihB" name="bigme-b6-navigation-bar" alt="The capacitive navigation buttons on the Bigme B6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xuJVCax6rFDR7rCfYpTihB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oKuNLJhMoZBsqUgn9UnehB" name="bigme-b1051c-b7-b6-01" alt="Comparing the sizes of the Bigme B1051C, B7, and B6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oKuNLJhMoZBsqUgn9UnehB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="XkHDWiQe5vabjj34vy6LbB" name="bigme-b1051c-b7-b6-02" alt="Comparing the sizes of the Bigme B1051C, B7, and B6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XkHDWiQe5vabjj34vy6LbB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>If you don't like the default functions, you can assign each button to any of several dozen functions. This was the saving grace for me, as I didn't really care about most of the default button actions.</p><p>The only problem here is that function changes can be a little confusing at first, since these are printed capacitive keys. The AI key on mine, for instance, is set to open the E Ink center for adjusting display settings, and I always pause to think about what the button does before pressing it.</p><p>I'm a bit mixed on the design, too. I hate phones with flat sides and edges, and this feels no different from a plastic-clad iPhone 14-era phone, design-wise. Some people will enjoy that, but that's not me. I'd prefer more rounded edges. Thankfully, the included folio case makes this design feel a bit like opening a book since the sides of a book's pages are normally completely flat.</p><p>If a Boox Palma is a little too small and a standard Kindle is a bit too big, the Bigme B6 fits perfectly in between those sizes as a great little e-reader. It's also hard to argue with the price. At just $179, this is an Android-powered e-reader that's hard to resist!</p><h2 id="e-reading-and-note-taking-2">E-reading and note-taking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mRVKEHaCMbd6mm7REeudmG" name="bigme-b7-buttons" alt="The physical buttons on the Bigme B7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mRVKEHaCMbd6mm7REeudmG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just a step up in size is the Bigme B7, another color E Ink Kaleido 3-equipped e-reader with support for a stylus.

Despite having a generous 11-inch E Ink Kaleido 3 display, this one is an impressive 5mm thin and made of aluminum. It's by far the most premium-feeling product on this page, and that makes sense since it's geared toward productivity and serves as a laptop replacement.</p><p>My unit shipped with a keyboard folio case that includes a built-in trackpad, making the Android 14-powered experience feel similar to a laptop.

E Ink means that this display is great for a variety of tasks, from spreadsheet editing to email or report writing. Bigme even includes a whole productivity suite, so if you don't already have a favorite set of apps, you don't have to go searching the Play Store.</p><p>This one is also my go-to manga reader because of its generous screen size, excellent dual-tone front light, and highest effective resolution. All three of the Bigme e-readers on this page have a dual-tone backlight setup, but I find that the physical design of this one looks more natural than the other models.</p><p>That higher resolution screen also makes a big difference in the little details I enjoy in manga drawings. Additionally, I find that the backlight on the B1051C is the best, with the B6 just slightly behind, while the B7's cool backlight is a little too green for my liking. Check the comparisons in the gallery above to see what I mean!</p><h2 id="a-note-on-color-e-ink-2">A note on color E Ink</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-letters" alt="Comparing the screen quality between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II with a few letters on screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I previously wrote about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/black-and-white-e-readers-arent-obsolete-yet">color E Ink isn't a great replacement for black-and-white E Ink</a> in some situations. Color E Ink isn't as clean or clear as black & white E Ink, and it's also dimmer. That means general readability is reduced, although I wouldn't call it "bad" by any means. It's just not the best option if you only read novels.</p><p>The example photo above uses Onyx Boox e-readers, but all 2025 color e-readers use the same E Ink Kaleido 3 technology, so the same effect applies across all of them. A larger reader, such as the Bigme B1051C, helps mitigate this issue due to its effective resolution, so keep that in mind if this effect bothers you.</p><p>This is the best that color E Ink gets at the moment, although it's possible that a fourth generation of color E Ink devices could provide some improvement in a year or two. Regardless of the differences between color and black & white E Ink, both technologies are far better for your eyes than an OLED or LCD, as they provide passively-lit options and are far more flicker-free than most other modern devices.

It's about the size of a standard paperback novel, but much lighter and thinner, making it more comfortable to read on. IT also includes a handy folio case that makes it look like a small book when the cover is closed.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is the benefit of an E Ink display over a traditional LCD or OLED tablet screen?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>E Ink displays are passively lit by ambient light, meaning they look very similar to paper. Since natural light can reflect onto the display and illuminate it, these screens are friendlier for long-term reading as they don't need to be artificially backlit to be seen. They're also flicker-free and extremely power efficient, as images stay permanently on the display until otherwise refreshed.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Can I run Android apps on these e-readers?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>All three Bigme e-readers on this page run Android 14 with full Google Play Store access, so you can add your Google account to them and use all of your favorite apps without hassle.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is the most important factor a potential buyer should consider when choosing between the three different screen sizes?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Each device's screen size fits its unique use-case best. The smallest of the three, the Bigme B6, is generally best for reading novels, digital books, and some light graphic novels. The Bigme B7 is a better choice for a portable graphic novel reader and excellent for note-takers, as it includes a stylus in the box. The Bigme B1051C Pro is the largest of the three and is best for manga reading and productivity, as its higher-resolution display better shows details in art and allows for more space in productivity apps.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

That should translate to around two days or more of battery life, depending on usage. OnePlus claims the phone supports 15 hours of video playback on a single charge.</p></article></section><h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-oneplus-15-s-battery-life-2">Everything you need to know about the OnePlus 15's battery life</h2><p>OnePlus's latest flagship is already available in China and is set for a global launch. When it arrives, it'll come with a few downgrades compared to the OnePlus 13, but not in battery life. OnePlus equipped its newest smartphone with a dual-cell silicon-carbon battery, cramming 7,300mAh of capacity into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-photo-samples">OnePlus 15</a>.</p><p>That's a significant increase over the 6,000mAh capacity of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/one-year-with-the-oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, which also used a dual-cell silicon-carbon battery, albeit a smaller one. Compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries, silicon-carbon battery cells are more energy-dense, allowing brands like OnePlus to put high-capacity cells into smartphones. The OnePlus 15's battery is 21% larger than the OnePlus 13's, which is significant since the latter already had a reputation for excellent battery life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RNDHdNYB8t85myGHxp9mhX" name="OnePlus15-SandStorm- edition" alt="OnePlus 15 Sans storm editions isn't all just the looks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RNDHdNYB8t85myGHxp9mhX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In practice, OnePlus claims that the OnePlus 15 can last up to 19 hours during continuous video playback. While playing intensive games at 165 FPS, the company says the phone will still last an outstanding 6.6 hours on a single charge. The OnePlus 15 can also be used for navigation for 12 hours straight. Please note that these figures are based on OnePlus' internal lab testing, and the actual battery life of the OnePlus 15 may vary.</p><p>Charging speeds are downright stunning on the OnePlus 15, too. The brand claims a five-minute quick charge translates to six hours of video playback, which is a staggering number. A 30-minute charge will bring your OnePlus 15's battery capacity to over the halfway mark. Not only will it last long, but it will also be quick to recharge.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-charging-speed">OnePlus 15 charges at speeds of up to 120W</a> in China, although charging speeds are typically slower for the U.S. model. The phone also supports 50W wireless, 10W reverse wireless, and 5W reverse wired charging. A full charge is reportedly achieved in just 40 minutes, another impressive specification for the OnePlus 15.</p><p>All these signs indicate that the OnePlus 15 is capable of achieving multi-day battery life, likely lasting two days on a single charge, although we'll have to confirm this with our own testing. For reference, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review#section-oneplus-13-battery-life-charging-and-performance">our OnePlus 13 review stated</a> that "excellent overall battery life means you'll never have battery anxiety." The OnePlus 15 has the capacity and fast-charging tech to perform even better than that five-star Android phone.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 will surely be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones of 2025</a>, and the battery is a major reason why.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="72b255f4-dfa2-4fe9-a6e4-2c7403b1d0e5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Battery champion</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 15 packs one of the biggest batteries we've ever seen in a flagship phone, with a 7,300mAh capacity that dwarfs the competition.

It will never be the best-selling smartphone unless Google builds a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">model under $300.</a> But its sales have spiked since 2022 in ways that any company making consumer devices would love to see.</p><p>I'm not going to go over all the numbers; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-breakout-hit-for-google-in-us">you can read those here</a>.

That's a 13,900% increase (<em>% change = today-2022/change if you want to do the math yourself</em>), and it's astounding even though the number started so low to begin with. Statistics are fun.

The first is that it's not the iPhone or a copy of the iPhone.</p><p>I know, I know, longtime Android users decree that the Pixel (and any other phone they aren't using) is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-google-pixel-10-is-eerily-similar-to-the-iphone-and-thats-the-point">just an iPhone clone.</a> They're wrong. Looks alone mean nothing; is the iPhone a clone of the Nexus 4, antenna lines and all? Nope.</p><p>Some things just work. Smart companies utilize these tools, even if they're trying to i<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold" target="_blank">nvent a new approach</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold"> in the background</a>. Size, shape, and camera placement are all pretty similar across devices for a reason.</p><p>That's why companies <em>aren't</em> talking about their "unique" device corners or glass edges. Remember when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-hands">Samsung tried that</a> and it flopped? What they <em>are</em> talking about is what the device can do.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We all have to admit they oversell these things whenever they're up on a stage talking about them, but you can not deny that the Pixel, starting around the eighth generation, has branched off into a slightly different kind of phone. One that does a lot of the thinking for you, if you want, and can even make decisions on your behalf. They tell us we really, <em><strong>really</strong></em> want that.</p><p>Other phones can likely do the same, but the fact that the Pixel is ready to do it out of the box is drilled into our consumer minds, and anything we see or hear about it from Google. The iPhone is not. It might not ever be. Apple has an idea of what it wants from an iPhone, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/poll-apple-adopt-rcs-or-bring-imessage-android">the company is stubborn</a>. That's what it will make, and it will not try to chase the features of the Google Pixel.</p><p>The two devices are very different once you get past them being rectangular, glass, and metal.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bsnXfM62ZMKeshCpWhMvrD" name="iphone-16-pro-max-29.jpg" alt="Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bsnXfM62ZMKeshCpWhMvrD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's also why the Pixel is eating Samsung's sales and <em><strong>not</strong></em> Apple's.

The process might be easy, but years' worth of paid media and apps, gigabytes of online storage, and your (almost) complete online identity aren't just coming with you.</p><p>I've used Android since the very first Android phone, the T-Mobile G1. It would cost me several thousand dollars to switch to Apple and buy everything I would have to leave behind, and countless hours of transferring what I could bring with me.</p><p>I ain't doing all that. Ain't nobody got time for that. You shouldn't do all that without a very good reason, either. If you want something different but not too different, consider getting rid of your Galaxy phone and trying a Pixel. There's nothing to switch unless you tied it to a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-old-inactive-account-purge-advisory"> Samsung account</a> (Don't do that).</p><p>One is no better than the other, but they are presented that way.

While other companies focus on specs and performance, Google markets the Pixel as a more personal phone that does a lot of the thinking for you and can even make decisions on your behalf, effectively morphing the device to fit the user's needs.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Does the Pixel growth affect Apple or Samsung more?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>While there's probably a small percentage of Apple users moving to Pixel, it's <strong>likely Samsung that is most affected by its growth</strong>. This is due to the fact that switching between Android phones is much easier than switching entire ecosystems, even if the process has become easier between iOS and Android. As a result, Samsung has lost market share since 2022, while Apple and Google have gained.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

I'm really impressed with the Pixel 9's 4,700mAh battery; it handles a bunch of apps at once, like endless streaming and social media, without a problem. I use it for monitoring the baby camera for almost 9-10 hours daily, including playing songs on YouTube on loop for when my one-year-old starts to throw tantrums.</p><p>While the Pixel 9's lack of a telephoto lens is a minor drawback, its portrait images are still exceptional. It's my preferred device for capturing fleeting moments, like my baby's expression or when he's showing off a new skill, especially when my iPhone isn't readily available.</p><p><em>Check out our guide to the </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em>best Pixel deals of Black Friday 2025</em></a><em> for more savings on Google devices.</em></p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="c9372d0e-e4ea-4c58-93d3-a19b014632c7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Unlocked-Smartphone-Advanced/dp/B0D7HWJDQM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="9r2TB3ryPNaJv37UDZK25j" name="google-pixel-9-official-render-porcelain-back.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9r2TB3ryPNaJv37UDZK25j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 9 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Unlocked-Smartphone-Advanced/dp/B0D7HWJDQM" data-dimension112="c9372d0e-e4ea-4c58-93d3-a19b014632c7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799" data-dimension25="$"><del>$799</del> <strong>$499 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Google Pixel 9 just hit its best price on Amazon, with a 25% discount on all the colorways, which is an epic deal!

The update says, "Following your feedback and suggestions," it will look to make pre-installed services "more flexible."</p><p>The company is also looking to give users "more control" over the bloatware installed on their devices.</p><p>What this means is, beginning "later this month," Nothing will give users the option to completely uninstall the Meta App Installer, Meta App Manager, and Meta Services.  Nothing says that it previously only let users disable the aforementioned Meta products, but giving users an uninstall option really puts that power back in their hands. It says that having these on your device brings better stability to the likes of Instagram and Facebook.</p><p>To backtrack, Nothing said in its OS 4.0 Open Beta post that it was looking to pre-install "partner apps and services" to help its BOM costs (Bill of Materials). While the company said this is a common approach, even one that Samsung does, users didn't enjoy it.

In a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/02/google-photos-maps-gradient-icon/">9to5Google</a>, it looks like the company's preparing to bring those same adjustments to a couple of popular apps. Via an unnamed source, the publication states Google is working on revamping the logos for Maps and Photos.</p><p>Regarding the latter, the Photos icon redesign is much simpler. It looks like Google will make the individual petals a little wider, and really embrace the rounded mindset. However, when it comes to the gradient, the Photos app doesn't hit quite as hard. The redesign looks like there's more of a bright spot in the center that tries to invoke that gradient, which only comes through modestly.</p><p>You can faintly see how the colors slowly shift between the hues, but perhaps, once it's on our phones, we'll see it in a better light.</p><p>For Maps, Google's changes are more evident, as it opts to increase the pin's center, and smooth the colors, so they seamlessly merge into one another. It's easy to see how the colors blend into each other, going from yellow to orange to red and to purple. The Google Maps icon is a little more stout, too, because the empty center is a little wider.</p><p>Nothing's appeared just yet, but it seems that we should at least expect these icon redesigns to arrive sometime in the future.</p><h2 id="google-s-looking-vibrant-2">Google's looking vibrant</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:602px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.67%;"><img id="FK2gSpuoJtDPTyRjBfKQmk" name="google-photos-icon-gradient-redesign-proposed" alt="Google Photos' reported icon redesign offers a brighter center for a gradient effect, while also widening its individual petals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FK2gSpuoJtDPTyRjBfKQmk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="602" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:602px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.67%;"><img id="VdyymR8KoDkiFCdohYapkk" name="google-maps-icon-redesign-gradient-proposed" alt="Google's supposed Maps icon redesign, which makes it look a little more stout with a gradient effect on its classic four colors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VdyymR8KoDkiFCdohYapkk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="602" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google's started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-refreshes-g-logo-app-store-update">refreshing its on-device app logos</a>, and even logos present elsewhere, since May. During Google's spring of Android announcements, the company revealed its newer, vibrant "G" logo. Much like what's been reported about Maps and Photos, the Google app got refreshed with a gradient color effect.</p><p>The updated icon was first spotted on the Apple App Store, ahead of its expected arrival on the Play Store. This change was just a prelude to something bigger, which ended up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-redesigns-its-g-logo-to-signal-the-ai-era-is-here">becoming reality late in September</a>. The "G" logo's change shifted in line with the company's AI advancements and tools, like Gemini. The logo's change marked a notable shift, as Google moved more into its AI models and the like, bringing the gradient shift across its entire brand.</p><p>We've been expecting the gradient changes to hit even more apps, and it seems we can at least expect it for Maps and Photos in the future. The only wonder now is whether or not Google Chrome will see a similar change, considering blue sits right in the center of the browser's icon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the images shown off at the APAC Summit in South Korea gave us a view of the trifold from afar, considering no one was allowed to hold the device.</p><p>However, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDAeAOK0Loc">new video</a> has emerged, giving us a closer and more detailed look at the Galaxy Z Trifold (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/04/closer-look-at-galaxy-z-trifold-shows-that-samsung-compromised-with-thicker-bezels/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).

The video also reveals that the display's bezels appear thick, which could limit usable screen space.</p><p>Moving on, while we don't know the exact dimensions of the phone as yet, it is reportedly as sleek as the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review"> Galaxy Z Fold 7 </a>when opened up, though it appears notably wide when folded.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dDAeAOK0Loc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Furthermore, we get a good look at the hinges of the device that are placed on both sides of the display, and the presenter also notes that the left one is wider than the right hinge.</p><p>You can also see that the camera placement of the trifold is similar to that of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, as the lenses are placed vertically on an elevated camera bump with the flash off to the side.

If you’re close to missing an exit, the system gives you early alerts with clear visuals and voice prompts so you can change lanes safely.</p><p>The feature will launch on Polestar 4 models with Google built-in, starting in the United States and Sweden in the coming months. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/polestar-live-lane-guidance/" target="_blank">says</a> this first phase will focus on highways, where lane markings and exits are usually clear, but support for more complex roads will be added later.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:36.17%;"><img id="da3nzk8RsWVyrhmaysncvm" name="Google-Maps-live-lane-guidance" alt="live lane guidance indicated by a blue overlay on Google Maps on a car infotainment system" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/da3nzk8RsWVyrhmaysncvm.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="217" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google also said that more vehicles with Google built-in will get live lane guidance in the future, but there’s no set timeline yet. For now, Polestar is Google’s pilot partner for the rollout, which makes sense because its infotainment system is closely tied to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-automotive-hands-on">Android Automotive</a>.</p><p>Visually, the feature shows up as an overlay on the in-car navigation screen, where the correct lane is highlighted in blue. If the driver drifts into the wrong lane or needs to switch to make an upcoming turn, the system provides real-time visual and voice guidance to help reposition safely.</p><p>This feature is more advanced than the static lane guidance Google Maps offers on phones. It adapts to real road conditions by using the car’s sensors to confirm your position.</p><h2 id="proactive-safety-alerts-2">Proactive safety alerts</h2><p>Google calls the new feature “customized, real-time navigation help,” and it’s clear why. Missed exits, sudden lane changes, and highway confusion are common driving stressors, and this system aims to reduce them by giving you lane advice when you need it.</p><p>Still, there are a few limitations. Since the system depends on both Google built-in and the car’s camera hardware, it won’t be available on every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-vehicles">Android Auto vehicle</a> or smartphone anytime soon. And because it relies heavily on accurate lane markings and signage, performance may vary depending on local road conditions.</p><p>Even so, this may be just the start. With Polestar leading the way, live lane guidance could soon become a standard feature in the next generation of smart vehicles using Google’s in-car system.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Whether it's a glitch or a hypersensitive new algorithm tracking stress levels, Samsung isn't the first smartwatch brand to confuse and stress its users with sudden data changes, and it won't be the last.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-high-stress-warning-one-ui-8-watch-3612357/">Android Authority</a> first called attention to Reddit posts from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> owners complaining of multiple high-stress warnings per day, having never gotten them before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> update. They also replicated the issue on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>.</p><p>I neglected to notice stress data issues during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic review</a> period. But strapping it on today, I noticed that the watch leaps from Relaxed at my desk to Moderate or High at the slightest provocation. Some feel legitimate, like getting excited while watching a basketball game. But other times, I get Moderate stress simply from standing, or High while pacing around the house.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vXivTi5zkKN85s6VhDUquZ" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-stress-percentages" alt="A Stress zone breakdown on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the user's time in High, Moderate, Low, and Relaxed zones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vXivTi5zkKN85s6VhDUquZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm certainly not stressed, and I flatter myself to say I'm in good enough shape that walking doesn't strain my heart. <em>Something</em> changed behind the scenes in how Samsung determines stress. But because the switch is so drastic, people are more likely to disable alerts and ignore the Stress widget than suddenly assume they've been stressed the whole time.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/has-the-sleep-score-on-your-galaxy-watch-been-weird-lately-too/">SamMobile</a> reported a similar (but inverse) issue earlier this month: Galaxy Watch owners suddenly went from moderate Sleep Scores to earning 99 or 100 ratings after normal nights of sleep. If your smartwatch data is too good to be true, why listen to it?</p><p>We're at the stage with smartwatches and smart rings where companies want them to offer medical insights, measuring for signs of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-hypertension-alerts-just-put-every-smartwatch-rival-on-notice">hypertension in Apple Watches</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watches-will-soon-detect-warning-signs-for-heart-failure">heart failure in Galaxy Watches</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/how-enable-loss-of-pulse-detection-google-pixel-watch">Loss of Pulse in Pixel Watches</a>.

A month later, Google had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/second-april-wear-os-5-1-update-resolves-bad-step-algorithm-issues">reverted</a> to the old algorithm.</p><p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-wear-os-5-1-step-count-algorithm-accuracy-pixel-watch-3">tested the algorithm</a> and found it did surprisingly well for challenging use cases, exactly as advertised. But <em>other</em> users experienced hugely inflated step counts, and Google found it easier to return to the old system that tracked normal steps relatively well than try to solve these "certain scenarios" where things went wrong.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nnDuZ7hazAx5n6ziBjbrDP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-14" alt="The back sensors on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nnDuZ7hazAx5n6ziBjbrDP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's new stress algorithm might be totally off, or it might be closer to accurate than the old system was, just overzealous. Other watches measure my stress as much lower, but there's no way to test if <em>they're</em> more accurate, even if I'd prefer them to be.</p><p>I can compare heart rate against a chest strap, GPS against my actual location, or steps against a physical count. And other stats like passive AFib detection require FDA approval for accuracy. But there will always be "wellness" stats like stress where we can only rely on faith in a brand.</p><p>I'd rather these watches give me accurate data than sugarcoat things; if I'm constantly stressed, tell me. But maybe these brands need to be smarter about easing us into massive algorithm changes. <strong>Tell us</strong> ahead of time that our results might change, and why we should believe the results, instead of assuming we'll blindly accept that we're living much less healthily than we thought.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For example, you can create a video of a woman interviewing an alien simply by typing that description, as demonstrated by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/soraofficialapp/status/1985766320194142540">OpenAI on X/Twitter</a>. Moreover, in addition to generating videos, the app also lets users share and remix AI-generated creations.</p><p>While OpenAI already has a video generation model named Sora, this is an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/best-android-ai-apps">AI app</a> that takes things further by combining creation and discovery.

If you're outside these regions, you'll have to wait a bit longer. Even users in supported countries need an invite code to gain access to the app.</p><p>OpenAI says Sora generates "hyperreal videos" with "unprecedented realism," and the app has already been a massive hit, crossing 1 million downloads within just five days of its iOS launch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zVc5XvqmLHrsZcFFUnwnhb" name="sora-app-android-ss" alt="Sora app on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zVc5XvqmLHrsZcFFUnwnhb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once you get access, you can generate videos in seconds by simply describing what you want. You can choose from various styles, such as cinematic, animated, photorealistic, or cartoon and even "change the vibe, add scenes, or extend the story."</p><p>Beyond generating videos from text, Sora also includes a "Cameo" feature that lets you inject yourself or anyone else into an AI-generated video just using an image. And even though the technology is impressive, OpenAI has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/openai-sued-trademark-infringement-over-soras-cameo-feature-2025-10-28/">faced criticism</a> for its handling of deepfakes and copyrighted material.</p><p>That said, OpenAI has improved on these issues in recent weeks, and now Android users can finally experience Sora on their devices. For reference, Google also offers a similar tool called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-3-veo-3-fast-fast-video-creation-vertex-ai-feature-teaser-announced">Veo 3</a> in the Gemini app for Android, which also allows video generation from text prompts.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google initially announced in May 2025 that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-meet-to-sunset-legacy-duo-features-in-september">legacy Duo calling would be replaced by Meet calling</a> completely in September 2025. However, that month came and went without the planned Duo shutdown. Now, a new banner in the Google Meet app explains that legacy Duo calling will stick around for a few more months.</p><p>The updated banner, first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-duo-final-meet-transition-3612312/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, now states that legacy Duo calling will be sunset in January 2026. Notably, Google's official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/16176860" target="_blank">support document</a> on the matter still lists the older September 2025 wind-down target, and has yet to be updated. Android Central was also able to confirm the updated warning message on its devices using the Google Meet app.</p><p>Before, the warning message read as follows: “Meet calling will replace Legacy (Duo) calling in September 2025." The latest version swaps the original September 2025 date for January 2026, giving users a bit more time to switch. The rest of the banner reads the same, instructing users to export their Duo data before it's too late.</p><p>"Before this change, export your call history and video messages from your legacy calling account and message settings, or they will be removed," the warning explains.</p><p>Exporting the old data only takes a few steps. Users will need to navigate to the <strong>Settings</strong> section of the new Google Meet app (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-apps-original-version-is-officially-gone-for-good">not the old one</a>) and tap the <strong>Calling (legacy)</strong> tab. Then, press <strong>Manage legacy call history</strong> and tap <strong>Export legacy call history</strong>. Users will be presented with a spreadsheet file with their Duo call history saved. They'll need to follow similar steps in the <strong>Messages</strong> tab of the Google Meet settings page if they've chatted with Duo and want to save their settings.</p><h2 id="duo-features-will-stick-around-until-january-2026-2">Duo features will stick around until January 2026</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="noF6sphRrraB6GwjwxbveW" name="Google-Meet-Legacy-Duo" alt="The new Google Duo banner in Meet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/noF6sphRrraB6GwjwxbveW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google has been winding down Duo for a long time now. It first announced the rebrand from Google Duo to Google Meet way back in 2022. Instead of having two different video calling services for personal and workplace users, they were combined. Duo remained in limbo for a few years throughout the transition phase. Then, in May 2025 the initial — now pushed back — shutdown date of September 2025 was set.</p><p>Google Meet has gained numerous features over the years since the transition was first announced. It can do everything from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-improve-your-appearance-in-google-meet">setting virtual backgrounds</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-is-letting-users-trick-their-coworkers-with-halloween-effects">applying AI makeup</a>. However, Duo features like the Family and Mirror modes or Knock Knock will be gone for good when it is sunset.</p><p>Google's extension means that if you're a Duo fan that loves these features, you have a few more months to play around with them before they're removed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Specifically, what the report states is that Google's operating system artificially "inflates" the signal (the bars users would see). It cites one key string: KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL. Within Android, this string is repeated several times for several major cell carriers on the market for consumers.</p><p>Android inflates the network signal for Verizon, Tracfone, Xfinity Mobile, AT&T, Bluegrass Cellular, Spectrum Mobile, and several more.</p><p>All of a sudden, there's a sharp change in the narrative, and potentially how consumers perceive the words spoken from some of these carriers. The publication continues, stating that Android's code will "report the signal strength to the user as one bar higher than it really is." It adds that this "always" happens, though it's reportedly unclear who's the one responsible for this artificial inflation tactic.</p><p>Another report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.findarticles.com/google-feature-will-let-carriers-automatically-generate-signal-bars/">FindArticles</a> states consumers can probably work around this, and discover their phone's true cell signal strength. The post highlights the existence of "About Phone" and "SIM Status" details within your device's Settings app. Users can check there to see what their signal strength is (marked by the dBm measurement). FindArticles states the closer your device's dBm is to zero, the stronger it is, adding that -70dBm is great, while -85dBm is pretty much the baseline before spotty coverage takes place.</p><h2 id="an-interesting-development-2">An interesting development</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="oNDxSFD4PGf89pXaFeweb5" name="5g-icon.jpg" alt="5G icon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oNDxSFD4PGf89pXaFeweb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Further digging shows that, apparently, mobile carriers can turn this artificial inflation trick on themselves, though it is disabled by default. An OTA update is seemingly required before cell carriers can trick users with this one-bar higher ploy.</p><p>On a different note, there's already talk of 6G, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-wireless/verizons-6g-initiative-said-level-up-wireless-communication-for-the-world">and it's coming from Verizon</a>. In late September, the cell service announced that it was kickstarting its 6G initiative, as it looked to partner with major brands like Samsung and Nokia. According to Verizon, 6G will "focus" on speed, low latency, and AI integration to deliver a better cell service experience to the user.</p><p>The company also hopes to have a unified global network for 6G, while also hoping to achieve peak data rates of 1,000Gbps. Samsung adds that 6G will deliver lower latency, which only speeds things up for users looking to connect with the world around them.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The two companies submitted the filing to U.S. District Judge James Donato, who oversaw a jury trial that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-games-total-victory-doesnt-mean-as-much-as-it-wants-you-to-think">ruled in favor of Epic in 2023</a>. It requires Donato's court approval before taking effect.</p><p>If approved, the proposal would prevent Google from entering some exclusivity deals with developers, sharing revenue with competitors, or making agreements with OEMs and carriers regarding pre-installed app stores. The settlement also requires Google to adjust Android to make it easier for users to install third-party "Registered App Stores." This updated process would make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epics-free-games-program-is-coming-to-the-epic-games-store-on-android">the installation flow for these app stores simpler</a>, reducing user friction.</p><p>Google and Epic have agreed on "neutral criteria" for the registration of third-party app stores, and tell the court the Registered App Stores policy would last until 2032.

It was among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones </a>last year, and it was largely used as the blueprint for the 2025 Razr release, save for a few small improvements.

For example, the leaked APK shows interfaces for adding invoices and tax identification numbers, which could be handy for business users.</p><h2 id="will-samsung-pass-compete-with-samsung-wallet-2">Will Samsung Pass compete with Samsung Wallet?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uc9HaLqrS6RYZYUsj5aJqQ" name="Samsung-Wallet-close-up.jpg" alt="Samsung Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uc9HaLqrS6RYZYUsj5aJqQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For now, the leaked version of the Samsung Pass upgrade isn't worth using. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/thatjoshguy69/status/1983998265222984048" target="_blank">Josh Skinner on X</a> notes that most Samsung Pass features unrelated to the new personal documents support aren't working properly.

The top-tier smartphone was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-new-oneplus-15-launches-in-china">recently launched in China</a> and is set to make its global debut soon. As you'd expect, the latest and greatest "flagship killer" from OnePlus packs in a wide range of improvements, including a fresh new design, blazing-fast hardware, and a reworked triple-lens primary camera system.</p><p>However, what really makes the OnePlus 15 stand out is its behemoth 7,300mAh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-talked-to-the-brand-thats-revolutionizing-silicon-battery-tech">silicon-carbon battery</a>, which should help make the phone go for multiple days on a single charge. But when that battery does need a top-up, how fast can you expect it to charge?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oxkKtYSJBUcYSXvpsSNuPb" name="OnePlus-15-First-look" alt="OnePlus 15 first look at Qualcomm summit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oxkKtYSJBUcYSXvpsSNuPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The short answer is, very fast!

With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger" target="_blank">third-party chargers</a>, the OnePlus 15 can be charged at 36- 55W in wired mode, based on the charging standard (e.g., PPS, PD) used by the charger.</p><p>It's also worth noting that the global variant may differ in charging speed due to various reasons, so it may have a slower charging speed outside of China.</p><p>Of course, a gargantuan battery and industry-leading charging speeds are just two of the many goodies that'll make sure the OnePlus 15 earns its spot among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there. The smartphone is powered by Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, which is complemented by up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of onboard storage. It also has a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED panel with razor-thin bezels and an ultra-smooth 165Hz refresh rate.

We can also expect that Samsung will once again offer up to seven years of OS upgrades and software updates for the phones, a software update promise that it has adopted for the past few generations of flagship phones.</p><p>This is a practice that Samsung started with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>. But what does this mean for you?</p><p>Well, it means you can hold onto your phone for much longer without worrying about it being outdated. When a new Samsung flagship launches, Samsung normally updates it regularly each month with a new security patch, and after some time, that cadence will slow to once a quarter and then biannual updates toward the end of its life.</p><p>Beyond monthly security patches, Samsung may occasionally provide bug fixes and feature updates. These would be separate from major OS upgrades, which normally arrive once a year with new features, updated UI elements, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6w5UthvdBXHJwg7fEnzRfB" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-android-logo" alt="The "Powered by Android" screen that appears when booting up a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6w5UthvdBXHJwg7fEnzRfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the Galaxy S26 series, we can then expect owners to continue receiving updates until 2032 and likely receive Android 23 or whatever the software will be called then.</p><p>However, it's worth noting that as time goes on, the aging chipset may not be able to support all the new features that are announced each year, as they will be initially designed to work on newer chipsets before Samsung tries to optimize for older devices/chips.</p><p>Fortunately, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>, which is expected to power the Galaxy S26 series, is plenty powerful and should be able to handle much of what's thrown at it over the next few years, including new AI capabilities such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">agentic AI</a>.

Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything.</p><p>Often, it's good to take a step back and see what's inside that pretty package. Was it worth what you paid for it? Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Early Black Friday sales</a> are already here, and we'll see even more in the next few weeks.

You know the one. The subtle desire for that sleek new rectangle nestled in your pocket. But a question lingers: should you jump now, in early November's relative calm, or brace yourself for the legendary, chaotic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">Black Friday deals</a> that you're <em>sure</em> are coming on November 28th?</p><p>It can seem like a modern tragedy in miniature. <em>To buy, or not to buy? That is the question</em>. But this isn't Hamlet. It's a parsing of promotional promises, and a glimpse into a future where your new pocket companion is smarter, sleeker, and of course, slightly more demanding of your wallet. It's just like a weekend in Vegas; a gamble, and trying to sort it out is like reading digital tea leaves.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-you-might-not-wait"><span>Why you might not wait</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kumMMHqk6SSeYYTugbAtoP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-13" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kumMMHqk6SSeYYTugbAtoP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The pull of immediate gratification is a powerful force. Is your current phone teetering on the brink, ready to draw its final breath? A cracked screen spider-webbed across your vision, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ask-jerry-how-can-i-get-more-battery-life-from-my-smartwatch">battery that drains faster than it can charge</a>, or so sluggish that tapping is a waiting game? When it's that bad, the immediacy of a new device trumps the potential savings of Black Friday.</p><p>Then there's the anxiety effect. The fear that <em>your</em> phone, the one you've been meticulously researching, will vanish in a digital puff of smoke during the Black Friday frenzy. The algorithms predict demand, but sometimes, even the most sophisticated models are just wrong, and the stock sells out instantly. Buying early can seem like a form of self-care, but you need to make sure.</p><p>And let's not forget the retailers, ever eager to dip into our wallets. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-deals-2025">"early Black Friday" sales</a> are already upon us. It's a gamble, a game of chicken with consumerism. Are these truly discounted delights, or a clever way to exploit our temptation? Occasionally, a diamond emerges from the rough — a genuine deal that warrants immediate action. We worry that we'll miss it when we really need a new phone.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-black-friday-is-a-tempting-wait"><span>Why Black Friday is a tempting wait</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YXvqDqiK97qLrV2AypLUjC" name="Android-Central-Black-Friday-Deals-2024" alt="Android Central's official Black Friday deals logo for 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YXvqDqiK97qLrV2AypLUjC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Black Friday sales are like a Siren song. They've been etched into our consciousness, synonymous with substantial savings. We're talking price cuts averaging between 30% and 38% on electronics. And while some might scoff at percentages, consider the sheer <em>volume</em> of devices on offer and the potential for significant savings on everything from flagship marvels to budget-friendly workhorses. Chances are someone will have the phone you want on sale by Black Friday.</p><p>Then there's the dark magic of carrier deals. "Free" phones dangled like a digital carrot, contingent on new lines, trade-ins, or the bundling of complicated Byzantine plans. A bargain, sometimes one that many find too tempting to resist.</p><p>And it's no longer just a single day. The "Cyber Week" period, stretching from late October through Cyber Monday, has morphed into a sprawling treasure hunt, an extended period of promotions and promises. The sheer volume of what's on offer is overwhelming, but it also presents a big opportunity for a discerning, dedicated shopper.</p><p>Armed with a little research and a dash of skepticism, you can navigate the deal deluge and come out on top, feeling like you made the right decision.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-digital-blackjack-with-real-money"><span>Digital Blackjack with real money</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xUtC4oeHRfASV3tty3AM2d" name="Meta-Quest-2-with-cash-money.jpg" alt="Meta Quest 2 headset with lots of cash" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xUtC4oeHRfASV3tty3AM2d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, what is the smart play? What is the right Black Friday strategy?</p><p>Be aware that if you crave the latest and greatest, you'll likely have to pay a premium. Black Friday may offer carrier deals on new devices, but the real savings often lie in<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones"> <em>last year's</em> flagships</a>. Consider your typical 2-3 year upgrade cycle. Is a slightly older, yet still powerful, device a worthwhile compromise?</p><p>If your phone is on its last legs, don't suffer. Explore existing early Black Friday deals or strong carrier trade-ins now. You might be able to save a few dollars had you waited, but you can't be sure.</p><p>If maximum savings are your ultimate goal, then Black Friday is your battleground. But be a savvy shopper:</p><p><strong>Do your homework: Research prices </strong><em><strong>before</strong></em><strong> the sales begin.</strong></p><p><strong>Read the fine print: Especially for "free" or heavily subsidized phones.</strong></p><p><strong>Consider older flagships or refurbished options for amazing value.</strong></p><p><strong>Most importantly: Track prices to ensure a genuine discount, whether you're buying now or waiting a few weeks for the "big sale".</strong></p><p>Ultimately, the decision is yours. Decide what matters most – immediate gratification, or the deepest possible discount on a slightly older model. Black Friday has evolved into an extended event, and shopping for big-ticket items has become more challenging than ever.</p><p>Me? If I needed a phone right now and a suitable device showed up at the right price today, I'd buy it. If I just wanted something new or could hold out for a few weeks, I'd wait to see what was on offer for Black Friday.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You just got a massive new video recording stability upgrade that's going to make your aging smart glasses feel like new again.</p><p>Just this week, Meta started pushing out firmware v19.2 to <strong>all</strong> Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses users, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/garmin-integration-is-rolling-out-for-oakley-meta-hstn-and-ray-ban-meta">bringing about several new features</a> like Garmin integration and additional recording options. Curiously enough, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/ai-glasses/1809764829519902/">the release notes</a> don't yet mention anything about adding new recording options, yet Android Central staff all seem to have them.</p><p>Central to the new options are a 60FPS recording, which launched on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> smart glasses in October, and a handful of video recording stability options. These stability options are even available on 2023's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1</a> glasses, giving users a free upgrade to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">one of the best features of newer Meta glasses</a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HwtY0iKr_tc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>In the video above, I put the three new stability options side-by-side on the Ray-Ban Gen 1 glasses. Everything looks great, and even the "low" option offers significantly better stabilization than what was offered on the same glasses just last month. As you might expect, there's quite a bit of cropping that happens when using the higher stability options, which needs to be taken into account if you just want a wide-angle shot.</p><p>It's not until you compare it with the previous firmware that you really appreciate the new stability method, though. I switched the glasses back over to auto and took the same run I tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> with, and the difference is nothing short of mind-blowing.</p><p>The new stability quality makes Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1's feel like a brand new pair of glasses, and the best part is that you don't have to change any settings at all. Auto is the default setting, and that's what was used to record that run in my video. It's unlikely we'll see 60FPS recording on Ray-Ban Gen 1's, but I'm not giving up hope for another free upgrade considering how great Meta has historically been about updating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/meta-quest">Meta Quest</a> headsets in the past.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The report states that this price hike could come from the rising costs of many internal components all at once.</p><h2 id="price-hike-likely-coming-for-samsung-s-next-flagships-2">Price hike likely coming for Samsung's next flagships</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-3" alt="Close-up on Galaxy S25 Ultra camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A report earlier this year cited that smartphone chipset prices have risen over 12% on average compared to last year, while camera module pricing is up nearly 8%. In addition, Mobile DRAM (LPDDR5) prices have increased nearly 16% compared to Q1 of this year due to limited supply. Adding to this, the smartphone tariff situation in the U.S. also remains uncertain.</p><p>All in all, this could mean Samsung might not be able to absorb the costs this time, resulting in higher prices for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 series</a> when it officially launches next year.</p><p>Samsung didn't raise prices for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a> over the S24 lineup in January 2025. However, Samsung did increase the price of the Galaxy S24 Ultra by $100 when it launched in January 2024, so if pricing rises again, it would mark the second increase in three years.</p><p>Of course, nothing is set in stone yet, and a lot could change before the flagship smartphone series officially arrives, but it seems a price hike is on the cards. Still, Samsung may choose to swallow the extra costs, especially with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-breakout-hit-for-google-in-us">Pixel 10 series performing exceptionally well</a> in the States.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This brings an entirely new look to the app, making it a much more visual experience, complete with a new layout and revamped navigation. However, it's much more than just a visual overhaul.</p><p>In addition to the new look, Google is rolling out a new AI-powered health coach to help you set up a personal fitness plan. This is sprinkled throughout the new UI, making it easy to access the coach from wherever you are to provide contextual responses to your performance and metrics.</p><p>So how can you get started with the new Fitbit preview, and how can you revert to the previous version of the Fitbit UI?</p><h2 id="who-can-try-the-new-fitbit-preview-2">Who can try the new Fitbit preview?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="bSwLmAhQeA9PqFvNY2u7e3" name="Fitbit-Personal-Health-Coach-preview-1" alt="Fitbit Personal Health Coach preview splash page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bSwLmAhQeA9PqFvNY2u7e3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4021" height="2261" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The main prerequisite for trying out the new Fitbit preview is that you must be subscribed to Fitbit Premium. This costs $9.99 per month, or you can sign up for a yearly subscription at $7.99/mo. equivalent. You may also qualify for a free trial if you've recently purchased a new Fitbit device, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-early-impressions">Pixel Watch 4</a>.</p><p>Google also notes that the preview is only available to U.S. Fitbit subscribers, but that may change down the road as testing furthers.</p><h2 id="how-to-join-the-fitbit-preview-2">How to join the Fitbit preview</h2><p>1.

However, a new range of universal trackers is now widely available, allowing users to pair them with both Android and iOS devices.

While Tile by Life360 is more widely known, you may or may not be as familiar with the latter names.</p><p>I'm here to tell you that both Chipolo and Pebblebee have amazing trackers.

The most popular shape is a circular chip, featuring a hole or loop that allows for attachment to a key ring. Since they're so small and lightweight, you can even attach them to pet collars, though most brands don't advertise them as such for legal reasons.</p><p>Chipolo's keychain attachment is called the LOOP, whereas Pebblebee's take on it is called the Clip. They compete directly with the Tile by Life360 Pro (2024). I use all of these brands regularly and can say that their loudness levels are more or less the same, which is why I did not mention volume levels in my comparison.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Chipolo LOOP (2025)</p></th><th  ><p>Pebblebee Clip Universal (2024)</p></th><th  ><p>Tile by Life360 Pro (2024)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Range</p></td><td  ><p>400ft / 120m</p></td><td  ><p>500ft / 150m</p></td><td  ><p>500ft / 150m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water and dust resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP67</p></td><td  ><p>IPX6</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>6 months, rechargeable via USB-C</p></td><td  ><p>1 year, rechargeable via USB-C</p></td><td  ><p>1 year, replaceable CR2032 cell</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p> 40 x 57 x 8 mm</p></td><td  ><p>45 x 38 x 8.50 mm</p></td><td  ><p>59 x 34 x 7.7 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Price</p></td><td  ><p>$39</p></td><td  ><p>$34.99</p></td><td  ><p>$34.99</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Chipolo LOOP has a superior IP rating compared to the Pebblebee Clip Universal, but it's also more expensive. Other than that, Pebblebee has the upper hand in this arena. Both charge via USB-C, but Chipolo lasts for six months on a single charge, whereas Pebblebee delivers twice as much — a whole year. Pebblebee also has a better Bluetooth range, 500 feet, as opposed to Chipolo's 400-foot range.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Tile by Life360 Pro (2024) costs the same as Pebblebee's Clip and has the same range, but it has a far more heavy-duty IP68 water and dust-proof rating. Although the Tile Pro lasts for a year too, it doesn't recharge. Instead, you need to replace the CR2032 battery when it dies.</p><h2 id="sleek-trackers-for-your-wallet-2">Sleek trackers for your wallet</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3361px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="RJBtjfkF9VW7ZNVADHxCrU" name="Chipolo-CARD-2025-universal-Bluetooth-tracker-charging-wirelessly-lifestyle" alt="Chipolo CARD universal Bluetooth tracker for Android and iOS charging wirelessly on a magnetic Qi2 wireless charging stand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RJBtjfkF9VW7ZNVADHxCrU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3361" height="1890" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3526px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="uNdgwghJvxs92wpdRhLrVV" name="chipolo-universal-bluetooth-trackers-lifestyle-2" alt="Chipolo's universal Bluetooth trackers for Android and iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNdgwghJvxs92wpdRhLrVV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3526" height="1984" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3821px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="mTBwoT3YsQcT4q3LVtzYcV" name="chipolo-universal-bluetooth-trackers-lifestyle-1" alt="Chipolo's universal Bluetooth trackers for Android and iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mTBwoT3YsQcT4q3LVtzYcV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3821" height="2149" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The second most commonly preferred type of Bluetooth tracker is a wallet tracker. These are shaped like credit cards and can be just as slim, depending on which brand you buy from.</p><p>Chipolo's CARD stands out because not only is it rechargeable, but it features magnetic Qi wireless charging (not Qi2, just plain old Qi). I interviewed the company's co-founder and CDO about this clever contraption in detail, which you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/chipolo-magnetic-wireless-charging-bluetooth-trackers-interview"><strong>read here</strong></a> if you're interested.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Chipolo CARD (2025)</p></th><th  ><p>Pebblebee Card Universal (2024)</p></th><th  ><p>Tile by Life360 Slim (2024)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Range</p></td><td  ><p>400ft / 120m</p></td><td  ><p>500ft / 150m</p></td><td  ><p>350ft / 100m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water and dust resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP67</p></td><td  ><p>IPX6</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>6 months, rechargeable via Qi wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>1.5 years, rechargeable via proprietary magnetic USB-C cable</p></td><td  ><p>3 years, non-replaceable</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>85.2 x 53.6 x 2.5 mm</p></td><td  ><p>96 x 106 x 14 mm</p></td><td  ><p>85.4 x 53.9 x 2.5 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Price</p></td><td  ><p>$39</p></td><td  ><p>$34.99</p></td><td  ><p>$29.98</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It's so disappointing to see that Tile couldn't figure out a way to make its card-shaped tracker rechargeable. It'll need to be disposed of after three years, meaning you'll end up buying another one and spending far more money in the long run.</p><p>Pebblebee's Card is rechargeable, but you need to use a special magnetic charging cable with a Type-C port on one end. If you lose the cable, you're done for.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chipolo's pricier CARD recharges via any Qi, Qi2, or MagSafe wireless charger. It's awesome because it's so versatile and not proprietary, so you don't have to worry about losing the cable. Despite this, it's just as thin as the Tile Slim!</p><h2 id="google-fast-pair-makes-setting-up-instantaneous-2">Google Fast Pair makes setting up instantaneous</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.38%;"><img id="LaV7ECmvFGRYwAjY6dTdUH" name="chipolo-and-pebblebee-universal-bluetooth-trackers-setup-1" alt="Setting up Pebblebee and Chipolo's universal Bluetooth trackers for Android and iOS using Google Fast Pair and Find Hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LaV7ECmvFGRYwAjY6dTdUH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2410" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.38%;"><img id="4B8vDUGUKgHcebspxnm6QH" name="chipolo-and-pebblebee-universal-bluetooth-trackers-setup-2" alt="Setting up Pebblebee and Chipolo's universal Bluetooth trackers for Android and iOS using Google Fast Pair and Find Hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4B8vDUGUKgHcebspxnm6QH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2410" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Setting up the universal trackers from Chipolo and Pebblebee is incredibly quick and easy, thanks to Google Fast Pair and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find Hub</a>. Before you have time to process what's happening, everything sets up. You don't even need the dedicated brands' apps on your phone. Both Chipolo and Pebblebee's universal trackers are added to the Google Find Hub, and you can manage them from there.</p><p>All three brands' trackers can be used as is without purchasing a monthly subscription; however, you may not be able to make the most of them at times. Life360 offers a free membership tier, but to enjoy the best features of your Tile tracker, such as live location sharing, you must be on a paid plan for $14.99/month or $24.99/month. Chipolo has no premium plans, giving you all the features for free within the app. Pebblebee has an Alert Live subscription that costs just $2.99/month or $24.99/year for live GPS location updates and alerts.</p><p>If you're willing to pay a premium for more than just Bluetooth tracking, Pebblebee's plan is worth the splurge.</p><h2 id="which-bluetooth-tracker-should-you-opt-for-2">Which Bluetooth tracker should you opt for?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YEMwRma2FGGmHbw5ZQwB6P" name="pebblebee-universal-bluetooth-tracker-lifestyle" alt="Pebblebee's universal Bluetooth tracker for Android and iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YEMwRma2FGGmHbw5ZQwB6P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When buying a Bluetooth tracker intended for use on a keychain, I'd say it depends on where you live. If you're in a tropical region subject to constant rainfall, it's probably best to opt for something with robust waterproofing. This would give Tile by Life360 the edge over the rest, but the Tile Pro's replaceable cell is cumbersome.</p><p>I recommend getting the Pebblebee Clip Universal instead. It's the whole package for the cheapest price among the three. You get IPX6 water resistance, a USB-C cable for charging, and a year-long battery life. I myself use the Clip on my car key fob. Pebblebee includes a sturdy key ring, which is a nice bonus.</p><p>When it comes to wallet trackers, the Chipolo CARD is the reigning champion. Tile's entry doesn't even recharge; you'll have to toss it after three years, creating e-waste. Meanwhile, the Chipolo CARD recharges wirelessly, so you don't have to worry about having your proprietary cable around like the Pebblebee Card requires. For about $4 more, you get magnetic Qi wireless charging and a vastly superior IP rating, so it's the one you should pick.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b99dad04-3600-4d78-9708-9977216e0418">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/STKPs5kn2E9McaYthR8mr3.jpg' alt="Chipolo CARD (2025) universal Bluetooth tracker for Android and iOS square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Chipolo CARD (2025)</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="100" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Recharge it wirelessly</strong></em></p><p>The Chipolo CARD has a 400ft Bluetooth range, uses magnetic Qi wireless charging, and features a robust IP67 rating.

They offer outstanding sound quality and superb active noise cancellation, but they've always come with a few qualifiers. They're the best <em>if</em> you happen to be deep into the Apple ecosystem. They're the best <em>if</em> they fit comfortably and securely in your ears.</p><p>Apple tried to address one of these pain points with the AirPods Pro 3, and you can probably guess which one. AirPods Pro 3 aren't any friendlier with Android or Windows devices, but they do have a refreshed design with new ear tips that claim to address comfort and fit for the masses. The earbuds borrow quite a bit from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a>, including the insertion angle and heart-rate monitor for workout tracking.</p><p>The AirPods Pro 3 are said to have "the world's best ANC of any in-ear wireless headphones," along with improved sound quality. After a month of testing, I can say that's probably true. However, as someone who has struggled with comfort on the AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2, I'm disappointed to report that the AirPods Pro 3 aren't much better.</p><p>Testing AirPods Pro 3 with an unforgiving ear shape reminded me that standout ANC or sound quality can't compensate for weak fundamentals, such as fit. For those who find the AirPods Pro 3 comfortable and secure, these are the best-in-class earbuds. They're just not a one-size-fits-all solution, and competitors do a better job at accommodating different ears.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-airpods-pro-3-pricing-specs-and-availability"><span>AirPods Pro 3: Pricing, specs, and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3KZAJorCXjnSadyXnpnS4o" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-7" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3KZAJorCXjnSadyXnpnS4o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple launched the AirPods Pro 3 on Sept. 19, 2025 following an announcement alongside the iPhone 17 series.

This allows the sound to go straight into your ear canal for better quality and volume. The redesigned earbuds, packing vents that control airflow, help create a better spatial feel and improved sound quality across the board.</p><p>AirPods Pro 3 appear to use the exact same drivers as their predecessor, which Apple calls a "custom high-excursion driver." The earbuds are also powered by the same chip, the Apple H2. It may be hard to believe, but the AirPods Pro 3 really do sound better, largely due to the redesigned "multiport acoustic architecture" and fresh tuning.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8WDxM8sZjKayJLvuEtz3Lo" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-3" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8WDxM8sZjKayJLvuEtz3Lo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">You can see the AirPods Pro 3 vents that help create what Apple calls a "multiport acoustic architecture." </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple uses an "Adaptive EQ" to set the sound signature for AirPods, and it isn't customizable like most earbuds. This time, the AirPods Pro 3 feature much deeper and stronger low-end frequencies with bright highs. Apple says its new Adaptive EQ "transforms the bass response" and "brings vivid vocal clarity to higher frequencies," which is readily apparent even to casual listeners when playing music with AirPods Pro 3.</p><p>I don't mind the new sound signature, although a common criticism with this style of tuning is that mids are occasionally lost through overemphasizing the lows and highs. In this case, I find that AirPods Pro 3 are exciting to listen to, even if they aren't the most balanced earbuds on the market.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7YMPXAKQchS6mVsiiomaAo" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-13" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7YMPXAKQchS6mVsiiomaAo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Songs that already have a good amount of bass, like Raekwon's "Guillotine," are reproduced well without an overwhelming feel. The bass-centric audio profile seems to affect tracks that lie in the middle, such as Alessia Cara's "Slow Motion," a pop piece with a groovy baseline that AirPods Pro 3 turn into a focal point. It's also not rare to see the earbuds highlight sounds at the high end of the spectrum, which I heard from the hi-hat and ride cymbal in Supertramp's soft rock title "Oh Darling."</p><p>The problem is that, because Apple presets Adaptive EQ and you can't adjust it yourself, listeners will have no recourse if they hate it. I'm sure there are some people who will prefer the AirPods Pro 2's sound signature over the new one, and it's a shame custom EQ support isn't here.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TbvcFwxCdewV366haVH37o" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-5" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbvcFwxCdewV366haVH37o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Active noise-canceling is also improved, with Apple claiming it's up to two times better than the AirPods Pro 2 and up to four times better than the AirPods Pro 3. Those claims check out, but they may be related to the brand's switch to hybrid ear tips, which combine foam and silicone to passively block more unwanted noise than the older silicone versions.</p><p>Unless you're trying to use the AirPods Pro 3 as your only pair of ANC headphones, ditching over-ear headphones entirely, the gains probably won't matter much. That said, I can use the AirPods Pro 3 on a plane in a pinch, which I haven't been able to say about other in-ears.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6cye9yzY7iYisYQRfyLTKo" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-15" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6cye9yzY7iYisYQRfyLTKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth giving Apple a tip of the cap for all the software features it added to AirPods Pro 3.

Best of all, Apple tends to upgrade AirPods over time and release software updates regularly — many of these features are also coming to AirPods Pro 2 owners for free.</p><p>As an added bonus, AirPods Pro 3 have an optical heart rate sensor for light workout tracking. It's nice for when you forget to wear a proper workout tracker, and we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/airpods-pro-3-feature-want-google-samsung-to-copy">in-depth coverage of the feature here</a>. However, Powerbeats Pro 2 will be undoubtedly better for workouts than AirPods Pro 3, and were the first to add the functionality.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-airpods-pro-3-what-s-not-good"><span>AirPods Pro 3: What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d7A9mEhCcG4yPVQd3jeX8o" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-11" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d7A9mEhCcG4yPVQd3jeX8o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Features & comparisons</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/airpods-pro-3-vs-google-pixel-buds-pro-2-best-for-live-translate" target="_blank"><strong>Live Translate: Pixel Buds Pro 2 vs. AirPods Pro 3</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/airpods-pro-3-feature-want-google-samsung-to-copy" target="_blank"><strong>Heart rate tracking on AirPods Pro 3 </strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-pro" target="_blank"><strong>Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Pro</strong></a></p></div></div><p>In my experience, Apple's ambitious claims about improved fit are only partially true. The hybrid ear tips, which feature a silicone exterior for flexibility and sweatproofing plus a foam interior that expands to fill your ear canal when inserted, work as expected. The AirPods Pro 3 are the most secure pair of AirPods I've used, and they stayed in place during a 5K run, requiring only a handful of adjustments throughout.</p><p>While they are secure, I don't find them very comfortable. To get a great seal (necessary for ANC) and a fit that won't slip out of your ears, you might need to use an ear tip size larger than you'd typically find comfortable. If you go smaller, comfort might be improved, but fitment and seal suffer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fq9aSXR4HU9eAS5FikZd5o" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-8" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fq9aSXR4HU9eAS5FikZd5o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I struggled with AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2 fit, too, but I prefer the older models. Even being slightly less secure, they're more comfortable and seem to create a better seal while doing so.</p><p>Of course, I'm only one person, and I've seen all kinds of takes regarding AirPods Pro 3 on social media. There are camps that find AirPods Pro 3 better, worse, and the same in terms of fit. It's unfortunate that there is a strong possibility AirPods Pro 2 owners will upgrade only to find their fit isn't as good. The only way to find out for sure is to try them in your ears firsthand.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-airpods-pro-3-competition"><span>AirPods Pro 3: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N8fBtL5kVLKD9gkvetaLC" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-10" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8fBtL5kVLKD9gkvetaLC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For most, the AirPods Pro 3 will be competing with the AirPods Pro 2. The jump from AirPods Pro to AirPods Pro 2 was quite significant, but the one to AirPods Pro 3 is more modest. Apple claims the new earbuds are up to twice as effective in certain situations, which is likely due to the switch to foam ear tips for improved passive isolation, rather than a technological overhaul. The big reason to upgrade will be the redesigned earbuds, which might fit better or worse, depending on your ears.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2446px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="GzX3yCE7HFbfqqDcmwQZZR" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-vs-Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-3-Pro-open-lids" alt="Pixel Buds Pro 2 vs Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzX3yCE7HFbfqqDcmwQZZR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2446" height="1376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android users will be trying to decide whether AirPods Pro 3 are better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a>.</p><p>The truth is, each pair first-party earbuds have their own advantages, and you should probably pick the ones that match your phone.

In fact, you might want to consider grabbing Powerbeats Pro 2 instead of AirPods Pro 3 if a better fit and heart-rate tracking are what you're after. The upgrade is a lot easier to justify if you're coming from the first-generation AirPods Pro.</p><p>And if you're a longtime Android user, it probably won't be worth the trouble of trying to use AirPods Pro 3 with your favorite devices — even if sound quality and ANC are marginally better.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9e21482e-2283-4677-b179-4829c1cd6e4e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mDDakVQLoJ8mPmv3LBAhxd.jpg' alt="Apple AirPods Pro 3 render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">AirPods Pro 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A tough upgrade</strong></em></p><p>AirPods Pro 2 were already an outstanding pair of earbuds, but the upgrade to AirPods Pro 3 isn't as clear cut.

Most AR glasses feel like strapping a paperweight to your skull. Lenovo is betting that its new solution isn't a more powerful chip or a brighter display, but a radical focus on shedding weight.</p><p>Lenovo rolled out the AI Glasses V1 in China with a price tag of CNY 3,999 (about $562) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://item.lenovo.com.cn/product/1050763.html" target="_blank">preorders</a> now open, with sales set to begin around November 9 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-AI-Glasses-V1-displace-the-Rokid-Glasses-as-the-lightest-AI-AR-glasses.1152389.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). The company is positioning them as a productivity-friendly wearable rather than purely a gimmick.</p><p>The build is the first thing you’ll notice: the glasses weigh just 38 grams, making them lighter than most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">leading smart glasses</a>. The lenses are only 1.8 mm thick, and Lenovo uses a resin diffraction waveguide display with a peak brightness of 2,000 nits.</p><p>It supports a 15 × 11 mm eye-box designed to maintain stable visuals even if your head moves slightly. You also get the choice to switch between monocular or binocular display modes depending on how you wear them.</p><h2 id="built-for-productivity-ai-2">Built for productivity AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1173px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="2RHz2gSFtwdoUS76y4TkcF" name="Lenovo-AI-Glasses-V1-on-face" alt="Lenovo AI Glasses V1 worn on face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RHz2gSFtwdoUS76y4TkcF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1173" height="782" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the software and features side: the glasses are powered by Lenovo’s own Tianxi AI assistant, which handles voice commands, real-time translation (voice and on-screen text) and information search. For productivity and creators, there’s a teleprompter mode (when paired with Lenovo’s smart ring accessory you can scroll slides or prompts without looking away).</p><p>Audio and input are covered by stereo speakers built into the frame’s temples and dual microphones, and connectivity is via Bluetooth 5.4. However, some advanced features, like the navigation overlays, are currently limited to Android smartphones only.</p><p>Battery wise, Lenovo claims up to 10 hours of use in translation mode, around 4 hours in teleprompter mode, and a standby time of up to 250 hours. Charging is fast, taking about 40 minutes for a full charge.</p><p>On the flip side, to hit that ultra-lightness, Lenovo trimmed a few things: there’s no built-in camera (which some competing wearables do offer) and the battery is smaller compared to higher-profile AR headsets.</p><p>If you’re into wearable tech and like the idea of glasses that do more than sit there, the AI Glasses V1 are definitely worth watching. That said, you’ll want to wait and see how they feel in the real world and whether Lenovo brings a version for international markets and different languages.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Earlier this year, we saw the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a> released, then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayn-thor-pre-orders-open-tonight-and-its-much-cheaper-than-i-thought">AYN Thor</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-ds-pricing-announced-along-with-a-few-surprises">AYANEO Pocket DS</a> were introduced. Now, Anbernic is joining in on the fun with the Anbernic RG DS.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEyUWDzoqq0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>At first glance, the RG DS looks almost identical to the original Nintendo DS Lite, as it's even available in a couple of the same colorways. However, no matter how hard you look for one, you won't actually be able to use those original DS cartridges. Obviously, that's not really the point, as you can download those games to your computer, transfer them to a microSD card, then put that in the RG DS.</p><p>The RG DS is equipped with dual touchscreen displays, with both the top and bottom screens measuring in at 4-inches, and coming with a 640 x 480 resolution. These are both larger than the original Nintendo DS, DS Lite, or DSi handhelds, and just a smidge smaller than the DSi XL (4.2-inches.)</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>Anbernic RG DS</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Top Display</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4-inch IPS, Touchscreen, 640 x 480</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Bottom Display</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4-inch IPS, Touchscreen, 640 x 480</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Processor</strong></p></td><td  ><p>RockChip RK3568</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>GPU</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Mali G52-2EE</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>RAM</strong></p></td><td  ><p>3GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Storage</strong></p></td><td  ><p>32GB + microSD (up to 2TB)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi / Bluetooth 4.2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Battery</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh (~6 hours)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Extras</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Hall Magnetic Switch for Sleep Mode, Six-axis Gyro, 3.5mm Audio Jack</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Software</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Android 14</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Dimensions</strong></p></td><td  ><p>160 x 91 x 21.5mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Weight</strong></p></td><td  ><p>321g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Colors</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Black & Crimson Red / Turquoise Blue / Polar White</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Obviously the big benefit here is that unlike the original hardware, Anbernic's RG DS is running Android. This means that you're not limited to just playing DS or DSi games, and have access to so much more. That said, we'd recommend tempering your expectations, as you'll likely start running into problems if you venture into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-turn-your-galaxy-z-fold-3-nintendo-ds">3DS library of games</a>.</p><p>This is because Anbernic opted to rely on the RockChip RK3568, the first time we're seeing this chip in a gaming handheld. It's using practically the same CPU as the RK3566 found in the Anbernic RG353V, but with a slightly more powerful GPU.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVAHh-DmDu8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>If you're curious as to why we don't have something like the Unisoc T820 from the recently-released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/anbernics-next-gaming-handheld-strikes-a-nice-balance-between-budget-and-flagship">RG476H</a>, it's for good reason. Instead of trying to shoot for the moon, Anbernic went the opposite route, and managed to price this dual-screen Android-powered handheld at under $100.</p><p>Pre-orders are now open for the RG DS, and you can get one for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/products/rgds">$93.99 from Anbernic</a> directly, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806075798680.html">$96.99 at AliExpress</a> (with code USCD12). Anbernic says it plans to ship RG DS pre-orders "before December 15," which leads us to believe it might begin arriving sooner rather than later. And when that happens, the pre-order discounts will vanish, with the $99.99 retail price taking its place.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8098cda5-fb16-445a-be14-591a3c8a4bb2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99.99" data-dimension48="$99.99" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PdiqpDiqPB3aF2r7KPxzMo" name="anbernic-rg-ds-square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PdiqpDiqPB3aF2r7KPxzMo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Anbernic RG DS:</strong> <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rgds" data-dimension112="8098cda5-fb16-445a-be14-591a3c8a4bb2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99.99" data-dimension48="$99.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$99.99</del> <strong>$93.99 at Anbernic</strong></a></p><p>Dreams of an Android powered Nintendo DS have been realized, and now, the Anbernic RG DS is on the way with a price that's pretty darn insane. </p><p><strong>Price check:</strong> <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806075798680.html"><del>$108.99</del> <strong>$96.99 at AliExpress w/ code USCD12</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="8098cda5-fb16-445a-be14-591a3c8a4bb2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99.99" data-dimension48="$99.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div> ]]></dc:content>

The Anbernic RG DS is the first of that subset, making this under-$100 handheld a no-brainer stocking stuffer. ]]>
