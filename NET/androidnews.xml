<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The original Google Meet app is officially done on Android devices.</li><li>A pop-up now encourages users to download the latest version with new features like reactions and direct calling.</li><li>The original app has been removed from the Play Store, so no one can download it or find info about it anymore.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The original Google Meet app has reportedly stopped working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphones</a> once and for all.</p><p>The original Google Meet app, which was once Hangouts Meet, debuted in April 2020. In 2022, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-duo-update-meet-icon">Google switched the Duo app over to the Meet</a> name as well. To keep things clear, the company labeled the first version as "original" and shifted focus to the newer Meet, which attracted a larger user crowd.</p><p>However, with two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet">Google Meet</a> apps in play, things got a bit messy. So, Google sent out alerts to users of the original app, encouraging them to uninstall it and switch over to the Meet that used to be Duo.</p><p>Having provided users with ample time to get used to the change, Google has chosen to sunset the original Meet app. Former users will be directed to download the rebranded Meet that evolved from Duo.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/16/google-meet-original-deprecated/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the original Meet app is now officially out of service. Users are greeted with a prompt to download the latest version. A pop-up in the old app points them to the new Meet, showcasing fun features like reactions and the ability to call other Meet users.</p><p>Android Central can also confirm that Google has taken the initiative to yank the original Meet app from the Play Store, so users can no longer download it or find any info about it.</p><p>Considering the new app has hit over 5 billion downloads, it makes total sense to retire the older one that only reached 500 million.</p><p>On top of that, ditching the original Meet app is a no-brainer for Google since it&apos;s all in on making the newer, more popular version even better.</p>

<ul><li>Google detailed two new features arriving for NotebookLM, beginning with a "customize" button to guide the AI hosts in Audio Overviews.</li><li>The other feature lets users listen to their generated audio files in the background while working elsewhere in the app.</li><li>Google is also starting its pilot program for a "NotebookLM for Business."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We've had a little over a month to experience NotebookLM's "Audio Overviews" and Google is taking the next step as it sheds the experimental tag.</p><p>With two new features on the way, the company looks to deliver more ways for users to get more out of their Audio Overviews in NotebookLM. In a Keyword <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-update-october-2024/">blog post</a>, Google states its digital note-taker is receiving a tool that lets users "guide the conversation." Before starting a "deep dive," the post states users can write specific instructions for the AI to adhere to.</p><p>Users will find a new "Customize" button beside the standard "Generate" one. Clicking it will open a floating text box that asks what the AI should focus on. This is likely where users can fine-tune the AI to their needs; however, Google gives a few suggestions.</p><p>Users can tell the AI to focus on a specific source, topic, or audience.</p><p>The other feature joining the fray today (Oct 17) adds background listening. Google says users can start an Audio Overview and then hop out and retain the ability to do other things within their digital notebook.</p><p>Lastly, the post highlights the introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notebooklm.google/business">NotebookLM for Business</a>. Those interested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notebooklm.google/business">must apply</a> as Google says its pilot program has begun. If you're selected, you will gain early access to "new product features, training, and email support." Since this is for business folk, Google states this version of NotebookLM lets users focus on sales via product roadmaps and feature specs.</p><p>Additionally, there are Training & Onboarding tools and more for marketing and product development.</p>

<p>Google debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overviews</a> in NotebookLM in mid-September. The application turns your scribbled notes/research into an audio file read aloud by AI. The feature delivers two AI "hosts," which makes it feel like you're listening to a radio talk show fueled by your research. Google states the AI hosts can summarize the provided material and "make connections" between subjects.</p><p>Users can add follow-up questions to these Audio Overviews and more. However, Google warns that the AI is prone to making mistakes (hallucinating), so it's best to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-notebooklm-limited-launch">backtrack its statements</a>.</p><p>What's more, Google reiterates the app's usage of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-1-5-next-gen-ai-model">Gemini 1.5</a> model. Its performance is roughly 87% better than the original 1.0 model and its ability to deliver "relevant and useful" information has been enhanced.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If there is one thing Android users do better than anyone else, it's making a fuss over things that aren't really mysterious or misleading. Thanks to internet brand rivalry and one-sided loyalty to a company that doesn't even know you exist, every little thing can quickly become a scandal.</p><p>The latest example of this is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> (and every Pixel phone before it) doesn't support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/text-message-exploits-are-scarier-than-ever-but-you-can-protect-yourself-with-these-tips">Android 15's stingray protections</a>. No, not the swimming, fishy kind of stingray; the small device designed to capture your SMS messages and phone calls.</p>
<p>The heart of the issue is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-mobile-network-security-pixel-3490909/">these settings did appear in beta builds of Android 15</a> on the Pixel, even though they did nothing because the phone's hardware or configuration doesn't support it. When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> proper came around, they were gone. As they should have been because they are not supported.</p><p>That's it. Nothing more. Many phones don't support these features, but because the Pixel comes from Google, who worked on ways to fight this, some folks think there is some sort of conspiracy afoot or something. I don't work for Google, but I can assure you there isn't. When and if the feature can be supported, the settings will appear.</p>

<p>This is worth noting because if you are interested in the protections offered here, you should know which phones actually support them. If you're like everyone else who wasn't going to use them anyway, feel free to say "huh" and move on to the next thing without any guilt over not participating in the outrage. This is why beta builds exist — to catch mistakes like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/335438231?pli=1">exposing an invalid setting before a product comes to market</a>. If not having this feature influences your buying decisions, don't buy a Pixel phone, and you're good.</p><p>There is something to think about here, though: what does phone security mean, and can complaining really make a difference?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N7Nvx7CVWYiToqZw8BHgM9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Plus-translate-messages-official-01.jpg" alt="An official Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus promo image showcasing the message translate feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N7Nvx7CVWYiToqZw8BHgM9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For some people, being an active target of phone hacking is a valid concern. The rich, the famous, the leaders of the world, these folks have to worry about someone getting into their phones and digging for information they do not want to share. Smart people with these needs have a professional manage their communication devices and use hardened and/or strictly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-business/1000">locked down devices</a> that are a lot safer than the phone you bought off Amazon. Others need to depend that their phone has the latest patches against remote exploits and features like stingray protection.</p><p>Most likely, you don't fall into any of these groups and are like me: just an average person who still doesn't want anyone to see anything I don't want to share. Security is still important, but not in the same way and not for the same reasons. We need protection from ourselves.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vBh9sfJXpxS7PQfMzmHdx5" name="google-pixel-9-vs-oneplus-12-15.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 vs. OnePlus 12 back view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBh9sfJXpxS7PQfMzmHdx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For us, the most important part of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-important-are-android-security-patches">security-focused patch or update</a> is the things that keep some random bit of code from doing things it shouldn't be allowed to do because we clicked OK on the wrong thing. Maybe we followed a link we shouldn't have, and something got downloaded. Maybe we installed an app that tries to do things it shouldn't. Maybe someone installed something when we weren't looking. This happens far more often than when foreign spies actively target our devices or SMS messages, but it can have the same result.</p><p>When the company that made your phone holds these security updates from you, and you get upset, that's a lot more productive than crying foul when a phone doesn't support a thing it was never advertised as supporting. Neither may make a difference because the companies involved rarely care about anything but profits, but our continued complaining might; even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/we/smartphones-moto-g-75-5g/p?skuId=631">Motorola now sells phones</a> that get software support for six years or more.</p>
<p>Maybe being outraged is the right call. That's for you to decide, and I'll decide where to focus my displeasure. Complaining about a thing long enough can make a difference.</p><p>Just complain about the right thing — Pixel phones (and all phones) should support some security issue Google found important enough to make part of Android itself. A setting that was in beta software but missing from the release build is a different story.</p>

<hr>
<p>On Thursday, Oct. 17, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company's second major reorganization of 2024.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/changes-knowledge-information-gemini-app-deepmind/">a blog post</a>, Pichai explained the reorg to the public and Google staff, with AI at its core. The post states that "AI moves faster than any technology before it," and it seems Google's leaders are interested in "simplifying" the structure behind the creation process. To achieve this, Pichai states a couple of its AI teams will see new homes, beginning with the Gemini app team.</p><p>Led by Sissi Hsiao, the Gemini app team will now merge with Google's DeepMind team, spearheaded by Demis Hassabis. Moving quickly is the goal, as Pichai states merging these two teams should quicken the deployment of new AI models in the app. Additionally, Google is interested in improving the "feedback" loop.</p><p>The other reorganization sees Google moving its Assistant teams into its recently created Platform & Devices team. The company wants to bring its "AI-powered home initiatives into one team and focus on improving user experience."</p><p>The remainder of Google's reorg sees notable members finding new (and familiar) roles. Pichai highlights Prabhakar Raghavan's return to computer science as he becomes the new Chief Technologist. Raghavan was formerly involved in the Knowledge & Information team, which helped facilitate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overviews-test-expansion">AI Overviews</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and shopping capabilities <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-lens-new-search-feature-lets-you-find-objects-using-a-mix-of-text-and-images">with Lens</a>.</p><p>In this new role, Raghavan is expected to "provide technical direction and leadership."</p><p>Additionally, Nick Fox is shifting into a lead role (SVP) in the K&I team to handle Search, Ads, Geo, and Commerce-related products.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-hardware-team-restructuring-merge">first reorganization this year was detailed</a> by Pichai in April. That restructuring created the Platform & Devices team we've seen the Assistant team move into today. The P&D team merges Google's Android and hardware teams under one roof to drive "computing forward." Pichai saw this as a chance to further the company's hardware, software, and AI efforts.</p><p>Google also shifted several of its research teams into the new Platform & Devices world to "deepen" the AI experience across all of its devices. Those teams involved are responsible for computational photography and on-device intelligence.</p><p>Google has doubled down on its on-device capabilities through Gemini as it introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-flash-model-access-expands">1.5 Flash model</a> in May. This "faster" model is optimized with a bigger context window so Gemini can understand complex queries quicker and answer them without much waiting. Then there's the extreme amount of AI packed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on#section-google-pixel-9-series-tons-of-new-features">into the Pixel 9 series</a>, which brings notable features. Users picking up the phones will find tools like Pixel Screenshots, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>, and more.</p>

<ul><li>A supposed rendering of the OnePlus 13 surfaced, showcasing a previously rumored change to its circular camera array and (perhaps) a textured back panel.</li><li>Another image, which is an alleged live image, shows off the device in white.</li><li>The OnePlus 13 may pick up a new BOE "X2 screen" at 6.8 inches with 2K resolution.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Images of the OnePlus 13 surface and point us toward a few design changes for the next flagship.</p><p>The latest rumors are two-pronged, with known <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1846936302538608802">X tipster OnLeaks</a> showcasing a rendering of the phone alongside a real-life image. The first image shows the phone in a seemingly official capacity against a blackwood beam. The supposed rendering displays the phone with a familiar rear design; however, the circular camera array differs slightly from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>.</p><p>For one, it seems the LED flash has found its way <em>into </em>the array, instead of sitting as an outlier top left. Moreover, this is likely due to the other design change, which removes the shiny "hinge" piece. It was more aesthetical than anything as the piece "connected" the array to the shiny OnePlus 12 frame.</p><p>With it gone, the OnePlus 13&apos;s rear array sits on its own and its apparent Hasselblad camera branding sits outside the housing, too. The device&apos;s predecessor offered a smooth "matte" backing, but the OnePlus 13&apos;s version seems textured.</p><p>Perhaps another change is the lack of curvature with the phone&apos;s back panel. It seems relatively straightforward until it hits the corners. Then, the device flattens out on the sides with rounded corners.</p><p>OnLeaks tacked on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1846937690358378742">supposed live image</a> of the next OnePlus phone alongside the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-and-x8-pro-specs-leak">OPPO Find X8</a>. This photo shows the phone in white, and with a better glimpse at that slight camera array change.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alleged first #OnePlus13 picture currently spreading over Chinese social media... pic.twitter.com/bBeNkVDrU5<a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1846936302538608802">October 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>This alleged look at the OnePlus 13&apos;s rear panel echoes what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-oneplus-13-leaks-point-to-redesign-and-upgraded-fingerprint-sensor">we heard in March</a> about that "hinge." The tipster stated the Chinese OEM was moving to remove that side piece that connected the camera housing to the side rails. Having the "hinge" there didn&apos;t harm anything, though it&apos;s likely OnePlus is looking to give the device a (small) refresh.</p><p>Earlier this month, OnePlus head, Li Jie showed off a new BOE display called the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-display-sourced-by-boe-surfaces-online">X2 screen</a>." Jie shared an image of this new display, but rumors quickly surfaced from other sources, claiming it could measure 6.8 inches with a 2K resolution. Enjoyable brightness and outstanding streamed HDR content are also expected as OnePlus leaned on BOE for a previous device.</p><p>Other internal leaks claim the OnePlus 13 will feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-memory-config-price-rumors">24GB of RAM</a>. Early rumors claim this device will be the only one to offer such a large memory size. What&apos;s more, this 24GB variant could be the device&apos;s top configuration — and a price jump for it is expected. The OnePlus 13 will likely rock Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SoC and launch earlier this time.</p>

<ul><li>A report claims Samsung is interested in boosting the capabilities of its on-device Galaxy AI to "predict" a user's needs.</li><li>This potential AI update is rumored to remove a user's need to dive into their settings as the AI will handle all their needs.</li><li>Samsung's Head of Mobile, TM Roh mentioned that its R&D personnel were focusing hard on AI as the "AI phone" has become the brand's new main business.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors surface regarding Samsung&apos;s alleged interest in superpowering its Galaxy AI with the ability to "predict" what you want.</p><p>A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20241013000049">ETNews</a> (Korean) claims Samsung is working to improve its Galaxy AI so much that users never need their settings menu (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-phones-replace-settings-menu-ai-predictions/">SamMobile</a>). The publication states the Korean OEM is looking to improve the "touch points" of its Galaxy devices with this AI upgrade.</p><p>These key points supposedly concern a user&apos;s keyboard and camera. Through this, rumors state Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> could advance to a point that it can "predict" what a user wants and deliver it to them without much manual input. The report adds that this is a new "AI software strategy" that Samsung is beginning to pursue, so more concrete details are unknown.</p><p>It also added that Samsung will look to "transform" the user experience on its Galaxy devices through its on-device AI.</p><p>What&apos;s curious is how far this could stretch beyond leaving the settings menu in the dust. The publication reiterates Bixby&apos;s voice command function to handle a user&apos;s task. More importantly, it notes that Galaxy phones don&apos;t have a way to "analyze" a person&apos;s habits for more practical uses.</p><p>A major update like this would be a dramatic shift for Samsung&apos;s AI, but we&apos;ve heard similar teasers from the company&apos;s Head of Mobile, TM Roh. Following its summer Unpacked event, Roh highlighted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discusses-the-ai-phone-future">Samsung&apos;s R&D&apos;s newfound focus</a> on advancing Galaxy AI. Roh stated Samsung sees the "AI phone" as its main business following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sales-of-samsung-flagships-are-reportedly-surging-despite-an-overall-dip">its recent success</a>.</p><p>Samsung sees the future of AI becoming "multi-modal" as it continues to work on it. Moreover, these changes could force the company to switch up its hardware to support its AI ambitions. Such changes could include improving the on-device sensors and larger screens.</p>

<p>Aside from Galaxy AI, Samsung is also interested in boosting the capabilities of its assistant, Bixby. TM Roh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-bixby-gen-ai-overhual-confirmed">detailed Samsung&apos;s plans</a> to "advance Bixby with application of Gen AI technology." The company&apos;s Head of Mobile did not explain the specifics behind this major Bixby update; however, user convenience was mentioned. Roh added that generative AI features are a "strong motivator" and "driver" for consumers to purchase its Galaxy devices.</p>

<p>At around 11 a.m., you realize there's a new pain in your leg that you haven't experienced before, so you make a quick phone call to the doctor, and, in a minute, your robot companion emerges from the closet, entirely remote-controlled by your doctor. They can run scans, have a full conversation, and even perform exams, all without you having to leave your home and go through the irritating task of trying to find transportation across town.</p><p>Later in the day, that same robot is driven by your 10-year-old grandson who just sat down with you at your dinner table.

Tesla's "We, Robot" event this week helped me realize that this idea is something fully possible right now with the right technology and it, once again, proves to me that VR is the future of virtual human interaction.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk took the stage earlier this week at an event called "We, Robot," unveiling new Tesla vehicles and giving a surprise look at the latest generation of Tesla Optimus robots. While Musk branded the robots as autonomous and hyped up the capabilities, it was found that they were partially remote-controlled by employees wearing VR headsets.</p><p>As expected, many cried foul, but I look at this very differently. Instead of worrying about whether Tesla can actually launch autonomous robots by the end of 2025, I think the company needs to embrace its remote-controlled strategy fully.</p><p>Optimus robots, remotely controlled by humans using advanced VR rigs, are the perfect way to deliver at-home care for the elderly, injured, disabled, folks with special needs, and more. While many science fiction universes have fully autonomous robots that perform these tasks, we're nowhere near this reality without significant safety issues.</p><p>Instead, certified trained individuals — along with people you permit — could feasibly help multiple people throughout every workday, providing meaningful human interaction when humans need it most. Here's a short clip of it in action:</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There is a person controlling it, like in the video below.

<p>Much like remote-controlled drones, robot operators would be able to see through the robot's "eyes" by wearing affordable VR headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>. Moving the arms around could be done entirely with the motion controllers included, although I could imagine plenty of scenarios where more specialized controllers or gloves would make more sense.</p><p>The current generation of robots utilizes a hybrid AI operation model, where operators move the robot around and the AI handles the actual task of making the legs and arms operate as we would expect a bipedal creature to move.</p><p>Tesla also says that some tasks can be fully automated, and I imagine routines could even be programmed to make</p>

<p>Communication would be granted through a secure platform that includes multiple layers of security, including local authorization codes, phrases, or buttons that must be pressed to grant final access to the robot for the remote person.</p><p>And, of course, there would need to be some sort of giant red "off" button or emergency override locally to ensure nothing bad happens. All of this is hypothetical, but it's built entirely on real-world solutions that exist today.</p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg and plenty of other folks in the VR industry have told us that VR is about more than gaming for years. Some of the focus has been around a broader entertainment or next-generation social networking angle, but I think the most powerful form of virtual human interaction can be achieved through a mix of VR headsets, virtual worlds, and remote-controlled robots for real-world interaction.</p><p>And while this sounds like it could be too costly for most households to afford, Musk says he can deliver on the robot vision for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267225/tesla-robotaxi-optimus-we-robot">around $20,000-$30,000 "long term".</a> Given that long-term care or hospice can cost thousands of dollars <em>every single month</em>, the idea of getting a competent human-assisted robot in your home for the cost of a few months in one of these facilities starts to sound quite affordable.</p><p>Aside from the sheer convenience of being able to "summon" healthcare workers and loved ones to your home at any given moment, remotely operated robots could be a huge boon for overburdened healthcare workers who normally might only have time for one or two remote patients per day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1871px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="sYdvUtbKN3CfRbwn7hCMRY" name="Tesla-optimus-robot-folding-laundry.jpg" alt="Someone remote operating a Tesla Optimus robot to fold laundry" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sYdvUtbKN3CfRbwn7hCMRY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1871" height="1052" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tesla)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Being able to claim a 4-hour shift and spend a solid hour with each patient by quickly porting between robots means workers would spend less time on exhausting commutes and more time caring for patients.</p><p>As I've learned from my own remote-only job, it also means they can have more time at home and with their own loved ones instead of wasting it away on a highway or at an office.</p><p>Tesla is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/unreal-software-engineer-virtual-reality-teleoperation-tesla-bot-227959">currently hiring virtual reality teleoperation positions</a> for Tesla Bots, and the description of the job sounds awfully similar to what I'm envisioning here. The biggest difference, of course, is that this particular job also includes designing the remote systems that'll make the robots work on a wider scale, but future positions will almost certainly just be for certified workers to safely operate the bots remotely.</p><p>If the purpose of making household robots is to enhance the lives of the people who own them, I can't think of a better way than to have that robot be the remote embodiment of people you trust and love. The possibilities here are nearly endless and it could easily be extended to help all sorts of people with disabilities, special needs, or even just remote socializing during times of loneliness or crisis.</p>

OnePlus India is hosting an online event on October 24, where OxygenOS 15 will make its debut.</p><p>OnePlus says that it conducted "extensive research and deep user insights to create a new generation of software that embodies the iconic Never Settle spirit." As with everything else in the tech world, OxygenOS 15 will include a host of AI features, and while the manufacturer didn&apos;t go into any details, it is likely to roll out a similar feature-set as its rivals.</p><p>What I&apos;m interested in is the retooled animations, which according to OnePlus makes the upcoming interface smoother than ever before. Legacy OxygenOS builds did this incredibly well, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oppo-coloros-13-review">switch over to ColorOS</a> negated some of those advancements, and I&apos;m excited to see if OnePlus is able to differentiate itself in this regard again.</p><p>There&apos;s also a new visual design, and again, we&apos;ll need to wait and see if the manufacturer can move away from the overt styling that has been the default in the last two years. With OxygenOS 15 set to debut in just a week&apos;s time, we don&apos;t have to wait too long. If history is any indication, the initial builds will be beta versions while OnePlus sorts out the inevitable bugs, with a stable build available sometime before the end of the year.</p><p>While OnePlus didn&apos;t go into detail regarding device availability, there&apos;s a good chance that OxygenOS 15 will be initially limited to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> — that&apos;s what the manufacturer did the last four years. I&apos;ll have the OxygenOS 15 build installed as soon as it becomes available, so stay tuned.</p>

<hr>
<p>While Samsung was late to the smart ring party with its introduction early this year, it did release it a couple of months ago. It was first available for the masses in select countries, including the U.S. The Korean tech giant now has plans to expand the availability of the Galaxy Ring, and it begins in India.</p><p>Samsung India has announced that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> is now available in the Indian market. It retails for Rs 38,999 (~$465).</p>

<p>"With Galaxy Ring, we&apos;re paving the way for a healthier, more connected future for all," said Aditya Babbar, vice president of MX Business at Samsung India, in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/in/samsung-expands-its-galaxy-wearables-ecosystem-in-india-to-bring-premium-healthcare-experience-with-galaxy-ring-starting-inr-38999">announcement blog post</a>.</p><p>Users interested in getting it can buy it from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/in/rings/galaxy-ring/galaxy-ring-titanium-black-size-10-sm-q500nzkainu/">Samsung site</a>, which is coupled with Amazon and Flipkart&apos;s e-commerce platforms. It will be available in three color choices: Titanium Black, Titanium Silver, and Titanium Gold. The company is also providing a sizing kit for users to verify their preferred ring size before purchasing the Galaxy Ring, which comes in nine different sizes ranging from Size 5 to Size 13.</p><p>While users can buy the Galaxy Ring through EMI options in the country, as part of the launch offers, until October 18, they can get a 25W travel adapter for free with the purchase of the smart ring.</p>
<p>The smart ring category has been on the rise lately in different growing markets. It is encouraging to see the Galaxy Ring&apos;s expansion in India alongside counterparts like Amazfit&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-helio-ring-review">Helio Ring</a>, which has also recently become available in the country.</p><p>Galaxy Ring offers 24/7 health monitoring and weighs up to three grams only. It has a titanium finish featuring a concave design and is IP68 and 10ATM water and dust-resistant. It is further powered by Health AI, which delivers real-time insights into your health data through the Samsung Health app. The Galaxy Ring offers generous health tracking features, which, needless to say, work effectively when paired with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cheapest-samsung-phones-you-can-buy-today">Samsung phone</a>.</p>
