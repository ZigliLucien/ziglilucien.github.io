                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>YouTube has started a "Test & Compare" experiment, which lets creators upload multiple thumbnails for a video.</li><li>The platform will alternate up to three thumbnails "evenly" for viewers on YouTube as an engagement test to see what catches their eyes and boosts video engagement.</li><li>YouTube launched a "Remix" test for Shorts creators earlier this year while also expanding its AI-backed "jump ahead" test for viewers in May.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube announced a test for creators that will let them determine which thumbnail attracts the most viewers.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/279488115">Team YouTube</a>, creators on the platform will soon pick up access to the "Thumbnail Test & Compare" test feature (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/12/youtube-video-thumbnail-testing-tool/">9to5Google</a>). Partaking creators can then upload "up to three" thumbnails for a singular video. The purpose is to gauge which of those three entices viewers the most to click on your video.</p><p>The post states that the platform will "show your chosen thumbnails evenly across your video’s viewers." After the test, creators will see a "Winner" label on whichever thumbnail outperformed the others. YouTube states a winning thumbnail&apos;s performance is calculated based on "watch time share."</p><p>However, if a thumbnail "likely" outperformed the other two based on watch time, YouTube will display a "Preferred" tag. If there is no clear winning thumbnail, the platform will display the first photo a creator uploaded to their audience.</p><p>YouTube states a test could vary from a few days to a few weeks. The amount of time taken is reportedly due to a "variety of factors" like the amount of impressions a video receives and the number of thumbnails uploaded.</p>

<p>The platform allows creators to go back and upload a couple of extra thumbnails to older videos if they choose, as well.</p><p>As stated on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/13861714">support page</a>, the Test & Compare experiment is rolling out to a "limited set" of content creators on YouTube. Those lucky enough to get in will notice a Test & Compare button when putting the final touches on your content in YouTube Studio. Those interested in (hopefully) getting chosen should ensure that their account is eligible by hopping into <strong>YouTube Studio > Feature eligibility > Enable "Advanced Features."</strong></p><p>Earlier this year, YouTube started a test for creators making Shorts, which let them "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-remix-music-video-rollout">Remix</a>" their content using music videos. Users could grab the video&apos;s audio through the "Sound" option, "Collab" with it by featuring their content next to an artist&apos;s music video, and more.</p><p>A more user-facing experiment rolled out for wider availability earlier in May called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtubes-jump-ahead-experimental-ai-feature-is-here-in-wider-test">jump ahead</a>." The test, backed by YouTube&apos;s AI, lets users automatically skip through a video to its best parts to save you time. Speculation suggests that YouTube needs a rather large sample size of viewers clicking on a video and watching to determine what those "best parts" are.</p>

The cameras are only so-so, and it&apos;s not a great device if you need loads of battery life. It&apos;s also worth noting that the phone&apos;s Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset was already a bit old in 2023, so even though it still performs very well in most situations, it may not be the best choice if you like using the newest processors on the market. </p><p>Despite those issues, the Motorola Razr Plus (2023) remains one of the best devices in its class. If you&apos;ve had your eye on the phone for a while, there&apos;s never been a better time to buy than right now. </p>

<p>Recently, the first renders of Google&apos;s upcoming smartwatch, Pixel Watch 3, surfaced online, indicating little to no design changes. This is probably because Google is gearing up for another new smartwatch to accompany it. Tentatively dubbed Pixel Watch 3 XL, the first possible images of the new smartwatch have surfaced online for the first time.</p><p>The leak again comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1800911312069054820">Steve Hemmerstoffer</a>, widely known as OnLeaks, who showcased the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-renders-leak">Pixel Watch 3 renders</a> early this week. The tipster has partnered with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/pixel-watch-3-xl">Android Headlines</a> to showcase the highly anticipated Pixel Watch 3 XL renders. </p>

<p>The design of the Pixel Watch 3 XL doesn&apos;t look drastically different from the Pixel Watch 3 renders, which are very familiar to the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>. </p><p>The Watch 3 XL, paired with some kind of white band, appears to carry the same seamless domed glass design sitting in a steel frame and aided by a digital crown. While it helps navigate the Wear OS interface on the smartwatch, the button on the top presumably triggers the Google Assistant, similar to the older Pixel Watch models.</p><p>The publication has also shared the expected specs of the Pixel Watch 3 XL, including a 1.45-inch display, which is slightly bigger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, which will sport a 1.2-inch display, the same as the previous iteration.</p>
<div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Pixel-Watch-3-XL.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Pixel-Watch-3-XL.mp4"></video></div>
<p>As the name suggests, the Watch 3 XL is likely to be thicker, with its body measuring 13.89mm in thickness. It will also measure 45mm x 45mm, indicating a bigger smartwatch overall. This could also mean Google opting for a more prominent battery capacity and likely some extra sensors to track health monitoring activities. </p><p>Overall, it is encouraging to see the Pixel Watch 3 XL in live renders rather than just hearing about it through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/googles-next-pixel-watch-will-reportedly-come-in-bigger-45mm-size">rumors</a>, which earlier indicated that it would be named Pixel Watch 3 Pro, complementing the Pixel phone lineup. However, Google&apos;s strategy appears different, as it is going old school by naming the upcoming smartwatch similar to older Pixel phones, like Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL.</p>

<ul><li>Google releases the June security patch update right after the latest feature drop.</li><li>It brings several bug fixes and improvements alongside new features for Pixel Watch and Pixel Watch 2.</li><li>The build includes features like Wrist Detection, Bicycle Fall Detection, and several others.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After introducing the feature drop for the Pixel product line, Google quickly released the June security updates for the Pixel phones and the Pixel Watch, which introduced some new changes.</p><p>The global versions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> will now receive the <strong>TWD9.240605.001.A1</strong> builds that include the latest security patch, bug fixes, performance updates, and also new features from the feature drop. While the complete changelog can be viewed on the accompanying Google Pixel Watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/279505749/google-pixel-watch-update-june-2024?hl=en&dark=1&sjid=14902075217234821058-AP">community page</a>, here are the major ones we should see in the new update rollout.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="kMRm7cMHhoycbzrZnkvYqM" name="Pixel-Watch-2-car-crash-detection.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 2 June Feature drop" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kMRm7cMHhoycbzrZnkvYqM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wrist Detection for both Pixel Watch models, including the ability to detect on-body and off-body, improves, especially for users who have tattooed their wrists. Both smartwatch models have also gained the new Bicycle Fall Detection, which now has an updated fall detection algorithm to detect falls from bicycles. </p><p>Another prominent feature coming to the Pixel Watch includes the popular Car Crash Detection feature. The Pixel Watch 2 can now detect "if a user has been in a car crash and calls for help if the user is unable to." </p><p>This helpful feature is further paired up with Emergency Sharing, which will help users share their real-time location with their emergency contacts when involved in a crash. Additionally, Google provides an updated Personal Safety app, which can be downloadable via the Play Store.</p>

<p>In addition to these updates, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-and-pixel-watch-2-feature-drop">June feature drop</a> is another essential release to look forward to. Alongside the features mentioned above, the feature drop also adds support for PayPal accounts for users who make payments via Google Wallet. Besides, the Google Home app has gained a major revamp that brings in a new Tile for both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>-powered Pixel Watch models. It also includes new shortcuts for users to control their fan speeds or rotation of blinds in their homes right from their wrist.</p><p>As for the June security patch, the rollout began on Tuesday (June 11) for the Pixel Watch and Watch 2 owners globally. Needless to say, it will be a phased rollout based on the user&apos;s device and carriers.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new leak may finally give us a look at the price of Samsung&apos;s upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> ahead of their official unveiling, and let&apos;s just say your wallet might need some warming up because it&apos;ll probably be pricier than their predecessors.</p><p>A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/breaking-samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-us-pricing-variants-revealed/" target="_blank">Smartprix</a> report, backed by industry leaker @OnLeaks, reveals the US pricing for the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The base model with 256GB storage is rumored to start at $1,900, which is $100 more than the previous version. The trend continues with the 512GB model at $2,020 and the 1TB variant at $2,260.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK #FutureSquad, today I have the #Samsung #GalaxyZFold6 storage variants, color options, weight and pricing (USD) to share with you!😏On behalf of @Smartprix 👉🏻 https://t.co/l4jtH9XYlk pic.twitter.com/14qD9DZbGt<a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1800829621044392253">June 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Furthermore, a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/z-flip-6-us-pricing-reveal-are-you-willing-to-shell-out-an-extra-100-for-samsungs-latest/" target="_blank">Smartprix report</a> claims that the Galaxy Z Flip 6 will start at $1,100 for the 256GB variant, while the 512GB model will cost $1,220.</p><p>The Galaxy Fold series has maintained steady pricing over the past few years, with the Fold 3, Fold 4, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Fold 5</a> all launching at $1,799. This was a nice drop from the original Galaxy Fold at $1,980 and the Galaxy Z Fold 2 at $1,999. But now, it seems like we might be heading back into higher-priced territory.</p><p>This price hike could be a tough sell for potential buyers, especially with rumors suggesting only minor upgrades from the Z Fold 5 to the Z Fold 6. The Galaxy Z Fold series is already Samsung&apos;s priciest smartphone line, and these increases make it even harder to justify for those looking for substantial improvements.</p><p>Even with the price bump, there are promising rumors about the Z Fold 6. Samsung is reportedly tackling previous issues by offering a wider display, a sleeker design, a bigger battery, and the latest processor upgrade. These improvements might make the higher price tag a bit more palatable for those on the fence.</p>

<p>There&apos;s a silver lining for those concerned about the Z Fold 6&apos;s weight. According to Smartprix, it might weigh in at 239 grams, which is 14 grams lighter than the Z Fold 5. For anyone who thought last year&apos;s foldable was a bit too hefty, this could be a welcome change.</p><p>Staying true to earlier rumors, the Z Fold 6&apos;s color options are said to include Navy, Silver Shadow, and Pink. Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-6-s-flip-6-colorways-leak-again">past leaks mentioned white and "Crafted Black" as possible online exclusives</a>, hinting at a more limited production run for these shades compared to the main three.</p>

Google&apos;s AI expertise is used in full force in the Pixel camera software, ensuring that your photos not only look good but deliver the most reliable tools to capture the moment the way you remember it.</p><p>But Honor has been silently improving its own AI-powered camera stack, delivering one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review">best camera experiences I&apos;ve ever used</a> earlier this year and even bringing those high-end features down to the more affordable Honor 200 series. It&apos;s effectively identical to what Google has been doing—offering cutting-edge software and processing on less expensive phones.</p><p>Honor also continues to focus on areas where it excels, including photo motion capture and portrait mode, both of which have seen substantial upgrades this year compared to last year&apos;s Honor 90. The partnership with Studio Harcourt—the famous French photography company founded in 1933—proves that Honor is serious about portrait photos on the Honor 200 series. But can it beat the Pixel? Let&apos;s find out.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motion-capture"><span>Motion capture</span></h2>
<p>One of the Pixel&apos;s biggest strengths is motion capture, or the ability to take a crisp photograph of an object in motion. This is why I&apos;ve long recommended it as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best phone for parents and pet owners</a>. But Honor&apos;s latest AI-based software improvements <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-photography-oppo-honor-mwc-2024">are equally good</a> at understanding <em>what</em> the phone is taking a picture of, ensuring your photo looks incredible every time.</p><p>I took the Honor 200 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> to Dave & Buster&apos;s for a fun day out to capture the excitement of the moment while playing games. The Honor 200 Pro matches the motion capture quality of the Google Pixel 8 Pro and even the Honor Magic 6 Pro, which is impressive given the price gaps between these products.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-200-pro-review">Honor 200 Pro</a>&apos;s motion capture is right up to par with the Google Pixel 8 Pro and handily beats the Pixel 8a. Despite having the same chipset as the Pixel 8 Pro, the Pixel 8a&apos;s lesser quality camera sensors mean that it simply doesn&apos;t capture motion as well.</p><p>The shot of the spinning wheel was taken at the same time by holding the phones side by side, yet the wheel in the Pixel 8a&apos;s photo is blurry, while the Honor 200 Pro is completely crisp.</p><p>In the second series of photos, the boy playing air hockey was captured perfectly by both the Honor 200 Pro and Google Pixel 8 Pro, freezing the moment in crisp clarity on each phone. But the Honor 200 Pro&apos;s photo is significantly crisper all around, delivering better fine details and less noise.</p><p>In fact, the more you zoom in, the better things look for Honor. The Honor 200 Pro&apos;s photos look like they were captured from a phone with a substantially larger sensor. Dare I say it, like a DSLR.</p>

<p>Even during the day, the difference between the Honor 200 Pro and the Pixel 8a is almost comical. The Honor 200 Pro is around $100 more expensive, but it&apos;s clearly worth the money if you value motion capture quality in a smartphone camera.</p><p>I took pictures side-by-side of my rabbit with the Pixel 8 Pro, Honor 200 Pro, and Pixel 8a, and the results speak for themselves. Photos with the Pixel 8 Pro came out crisper than the Pixel 8a but still not as sharp as the Honor 200 Pro.</p><p>Likewise, taking pictures of my son playing on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a> was nice and sharp on an Honor 200 Pro, while they remained soft on the Pixel 8 phones tested. The Pixel still does a better job at capturing motion than most phones I test, but Honor&apos;s motion capture is on an entirely different level, regardless of how bright or dim the surrounding lighting is.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-portrait-mode"><span>Portrait mode</span></h2>
<p>Honor specifically advertises that the Honor 200 Pro features the best portrait mode you&apos;ll find on <em>any</em> phone, so let&apos;s put that to the test. As previously mentioned, Honor partnered with the famous French photography company Harcourt Portraits for the release of the Honor 200 Pro.</p><p>This partnership enables a trio of new portrait mode options, including Harcourt Vibrant, Harcourt Color, and Harcourt Classic. Classic is a black & white-only mode, while the other two options provide different levels of color and post-processing changes. Here&apos;s a quick illustration of the difference between the modes:</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="nMi6BUM3yPFXiCngkFDzJB" name="honor-200-pro-camera-samples-portrait-harcourt-color.jpg" alt="Harcourt color portrait mode comparisons on the Honor 200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nMi6BUM3yPFXiCngkFDzJB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3072" height="3840" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Harcourt color portrait mode comparisons on the Honor 200 Pro </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="H2L4mZiXfjWnucj5eMqPGC" name="honor-200-pro-camera-samples-portrait-harcourt-vibrant.jpg" alt="Harcourt vibrant portrait mode comparisons on the Honor 200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H2L4mZiXfjWnucj5eMqPGC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3072" height="4096" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Harcourt vibrant portrait mode comparisons on the Honor 200 Pro </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="guo887qS7avoktfTthvn6D" name="honor-200-pro-camera-samples-portrait-harcourt-black-and-white.jpg" alt="Harcourt black and white portrait mode comparisons on the Honor 200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/guo887qS7avoktfTthvn6D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3072" height="3840" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Harcourt black and white portrait mode comparisons on the Honor 200 Pro </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>The benefit of having these modes built into the camera is that you don&apos;t have to edit them later. Harcourt Color is a classic color portrait style from Harcourt including vignetting and a specific color palette. Vibrant is a more "modern" portrait look without the vignette and with punchier colors, while black & white evokes the classic 1933 original style of Harcourt.</p><p>But Honor isn&apos;t just touting superfluous style that could be added with Instagram filters. It&apos;s also touting the quality of the photo, including fine details and the portrait "cut-out," as well. It&apos;s clear how clean and natural-looking Honor&apos;s portrait mode is when compared to both the Pixel 8a and Pixel 8 Pro.</p>

<p>While all three phones did a good job of capturing the moment, the Honor 200 Pro sports better fine details, particularly in the bokeh effect cut-out that separates the foreground from the background.</p><p>Google&apos;s method is still super messy and has lots of errors along the edges of the person identified in the photo. Zoom into any of the photos, and you&apos;ll see exactly what I mean. Honor takes the cake here, and there&apos;s not much of a contest, either.</p><p>Ironically, given Google&apos;s penchant for getting skin tones right, I found that my own skin tone was often incorrect when using the portrait mode on either the Pixel 8a or Pixel 8 Pro. This extends to the front-facing camera, as well, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Not only did both Pixels regularly get my skin tone (and overall color balance) wrong, but they also don&apos;t do as good a job at separating the foreground from the background as the Honor 200 Pro. Just as we saw from the rear camera, the Honor 200 Pro&apos;s cutout bokeh effect looks more natural and doesn&apos;t exhibit the weird fringing edges, particularly around my face, that the Pixel has trouble with.</p><p>Plus, the Honor 200 Pro&apos;s front-facing camera is just plain sharper than either Pixel 8a or Pixel 8 Pro. Ironically enough, I thought the Pixel 8a&apos;s front-facing camera photos looked nicer overall than the Pixel 8 Pro, particularly when it comes to sharpness and resolution.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-main-cameras"><span>Main cameras</span></h2>
<p>The Honor 200 Pro and Google Pixel 8 Pro both feature three rear cameras — one ultrawide, one wide, and one telephoto — while the Pixel 8a only sports an ultrawide and a wide camera. As you might expect, this means the Pixel 8a can&apos;t get away with zooming in too far without significant quality reduction.</p><p>The Honor 200 Pro features a maximum zoom distance of 50x but that number is mostly nonsense as it uses a similar 2.5x zoom lens that the Honor Magic 6 Pro uses. Meanwhile, the Pixel 8 Pro only allows up to 30x zoom yet sports a 5x zoom lens. Both phones feature a 50MP sensor behind the lens.</p><p>The images below give you an example of what to expect from both phones at 10x and beyond. The Pixel 8 Pro will likely win every time beyond 3x zoom.</p>

<p>Likewise, I found that the main and ultrawide cameras on the Honor 200 Pro often have issues with dynamic range. During bright days, the Honor 200 Pro&apos;s camera regularly fails to correct for overexposed parts of a photo.</p><p>Conversely, in dark lighting conditions, the camera tends to push too hard on the contrast, often crushing black levels in the process compared to the Pixel 8a and Pixel 8 Pro.</p>

<p>It&apos;s not always bad, though, as the Pixels often brighten up dark photos too much and the final picture doesn&apos;t accurately represent the scene as you saw it. If anything, Honor&apos;s solution here seems to more accurately represent what the human eye sees in these situations rather than what we expect from a camera. Take that for what you will.</p>

<p>The Honor 200 Pro is also a bit too vibrant for my tastes, especially in darker conditions. The neon-lit lights littering Dave & Busters were hyper-vibrant in the photos above, and even turning to change the default "vibrant" mode to "natural" didn&apos;t seem to help much.</p><p>But the punchier colors can come in handy in some situations. The incense burner above, for instance, just looks nicer in the Honor 200 Pro&apos;s shot because of the enhanced colors.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-software-and-video"><span>Software and video</span></h2>
<p>The Honor 200 Pro&apos;s camera takes roughly 2 seconds longer to load than the Pixel 8 series&apos; camera software. That could mean the difference between capturing the moment and missing it entirely.</p><p>While the launch speed is a bit lacking, Honor&apos;s software has a few more features than the Pixels. It sports a full Pro mode that the Pixel 8a is missing, and it also has better video recording capabilities.</p><p>The highlights include the ability to record video from multiple cameras at once—useful for reaction videos or other more personal clips, including your face and footage from the main rear camera—and even do a "solo cut," as Honor calls it, which means the phone can generate a single portrait mode video from a landscape video when tapping a subject.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nqUR2CUhjWo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Solo Cut works <em>very </em>well, as you can see from the video above. The wide video on the left side is the original clip, while the portrait video on the right was automatically generated using on-device processing.</p><p>I think Honor&apos;s intention is to keep this feature for events, like live music or something similar, where you&apos;d record a wider version as the master copy but want a vertical version of a single subject for social media posts.</p><p>The downside to Solo cCt is that you have to start recording in this mode from the beginning, <strong>and</strong><em> </em>you&apos;ll need to tap an identified subject <em>while</em> recording for it to generate the vertical clip. That&apos;s a lot of very intentional steps a user has to take and I seriously doubt many people will go through the steps. That&apos;s a shame, considering how well it works.</p><p>However, video capture quality on the Honor 200 Pro is lacking, particularly with dynamic range. The phone often struggles to get a good light balance even in well-lit scenes, often overcompensating for overexposed or underexposed areas by making the rest of the video too bright or too dark. Neither Pixel phone suffered from this issue.</p>

<p>At $500, the Google Pixel 8a is still a superb choice and an excellent mid-range camera that beats everything in its <em>exact</em> price range. Go up just a little bit in price, however, and you&apos;ll find that you can get quite a bit better quality depending on what you&apos;re looking for.</p><p>The Honor 200 Pro mostly sits somewhere between the Pixel 8a and Pixel 8 Pro in terms of quality while offering better motion capture and better portrait mode quality than both phones. It also sports additional video recording modes like dual camera capture which might appeal to certain people.</p><p>However, Honor&apos;s latest struggles a bit with dynamic range and often overexposed or under exposed elements in areas where neither Pixel 8a or Pixel 8 Pro do. This is also the case with video recording quality which was regularly over or under exposed no matter the lighting conditions.</p><p>Honor&apos;s more contrast-heavy images better reflect what the human eye sees, though, especially in dark situations. This may be preferable if you&apos;re looking for a specific look rather than something more technically impressive, but it comes off as feeling like it needs to be tweaked in a software update.</p><p>Still, the Honor 200 Pro&apos;s camera regularly pulls out better fine details in shots—especially low-light photos and photos taken with the front-facing camera—than either Pixel phone can. I was also surprised at how poorly the Pixel 8a did capturing motion, something Pixels normally excel at.</p><p>In the end, choosing between these cameras mainly revolves around what types of photos or videos you capture as both the Pixel 8 Pro and Honor 200 Pro specialize in different things. As a whole the Pixel 8a is the worst of the bunch but it&apos;s also the cheapest phone of the trio.</p>

In fact, the phone has turned a few heads since I began testing it, with some friends inquiring as to who makes the phone, but I&apos;ll elaborate more on that later.</p><p>The Honor 200 Pro is a flagship-esque phone that puts a particular emphasis on its unique camera system. In fact, Honor is the latest Android OEM to bank on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-9-hasselblad-partnership-announcement-launch-date">camera partnership</a>, teaming up with the prestigious Studio Harcourt to give the Honor 200 Pro a more professional take on images. The result is something a bit different than what I&apos;ve seen with other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">camera-centric phones</a> like the Pixel, but somehow, it works quite well and really shines when you&apos;re taking portrait images.</p><p>However, the phone is more than a camera, sporting one of the latest Snapdragon chips, a large battery with very fast charging, an eye-catching design, and the latest software from Honor with a few AI tricks. But is any of this enough to help the Honor 200 Pro stand out from the crowd?</p>

<p>The Honor 200 Pro originally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-upcoming-smartphones-will-include-googles-generative-ai-features">launched</a> in China in May, but the phone is making its way to Europe as of June 12. The device goes on sale alongside the Honor 200 for £699.99.</p><p>The Honor 200 Pro is available in a single configuration with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. It is available in three colors: Ocean Cyan, Moonlight White, and Black.</p>

<p>The Honor 200 Pro is one of the best-looking phones I&apos;ve had the pleasure of testing. In the two weeks that I&apos;ve spent with the device, I&apos;ve never had a traditional phone get more attention from onlookers than this one. The only exception has been flip phones such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-full-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, but that&apos;s really due to the foldable form factor. Compared to other traditional phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8</a> to some extent, the Honor 200 Pro really stands out.</p><p>The phone is quite slim at just 8.2mm, and it feels even slimmer due to the quad-curved display that almost melts into the metal frame. However, it&apos;s not the slimness of the phone that catches people&apos;s eyes; it&apos;s the beautifully designed back glass panel. It sports a dual texture profile, with a smooth feel on one side around the camera housing and a textured design taking up much of the back panel. The smoother part feels like a newer Pixel, while the textured side reminds me of the frosted glass you&apos;d find on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>. The dual texture looks rather unique, especially with the blue-ish Ocean Cyan color that I have, which itself is quite striking.</p><p>Adding to the uniqueness of the design is the camera housing, which Honor says was inspired by Casa Mila in Barcelona, which is full of unique shapes. The result of all these unique elements is a very classy phone that will rightly grab the attention of anyone nearby.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JBJbxjvX5vEmm2YRgtWziM" name="Honor-200-Pro-review-08.jpg" alt="The Honor 200 Pro back panel outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JBJbxjvX5vEmm2YRgtWziM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I really like the display on this phone. That&apos;s saying a lot because I&apos;m not a fan of curved screens, having had my fill of them with the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, LG Wing, and Pixel 6 Pro. That said, despite the Honor 200 Pro sporting a quad-curved display, it&apos;s still much subtler than the aforementioned models, and rarely have I found myself dealing with accidental touches (but they&apos;re not completely gone).</p><p>The display is bright, fluid, and packed with pixels, so content looks great no matter what you&apos;re viewing and where. Honor really wants users to have a comfortable viewing experience, so the display has a high PWM rate (a huge plus for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive users</a>), AI enhancements, TÜV Rheinland certifications, and other features that promote eye comfort. Outdoor viewing is just fine, thanks to the 4,000 nit peak brightness, and the display is quite vivid, even on the Normal screen color mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8hHYs9WVwSYRcepqVLzQy4" name="Honor-200-Pro-review-09.jpg" alt="The Honor 200 Pro display outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8hHYs9WVwSYRcepqVLzQy4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There&apos;s also an in-display fingerprint sensor, which works well, but I find it to be uncomfortably low on the display, nearing the bottom bezel. I would much prefer if it were higher, similar to a Pixel or Galaxy. Interestingly, this is also an issue I had with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a>, so I&apos;m hoping this isn&apos;t the start of some trend.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-200-pro-hardware-specs"><span>Honor 200 Pro: Hardware & specs</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Y5Nr2BubPNtfUdQQw4ZcTk" name="Honor-200-Pro-review-01.jpg" alt="Honkai: Star Rail on the Honor 200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y5Nr2BubPNtfUdQQw4ZcTk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3556" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While this isn&apos;t exactly Honor&apos;s top-of-the-line model, the Honor 200 Pro has some pretty impressive specs that would easily have you thinking otherwise. The phone is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3</a>, the latest high-end chip from Qualcomm that sits just under the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>. This is really the only indicator that this isn&apos;t a true flagship, but the ship is impressive nonetheless and still provides performance very well.</p><p>When things are working, they work well. Opening and juggling apps gives this phone little in the way of issues, thanks to the 12GB of RAM. You sort of get 24GB of RAM thanks to the built-in RAM Turbo feature that adds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">virtual RAM</a> to the phone, but unfortunately you can&apos;t turn it off. Still, it shouldn&apos;t matter as it apparently only works when needed, and 12GB is already more than enough for the average user. The phone manages to keep apps open in the background longer than I expect, which is nice when I wanna pick up on a game after switching to a different app for a while.</p>

<p>Speaking of, gaming is a big of a mixed bag on this phone. While graphics-intensive games like Honkai: Star Rail play quite well on the highest settings, less intensive games like Hogwarts Mystery seem to give the phone trouble, with quite a bit of freezing and even some crashing. I can&apos;t really tell if it&apos;s an issue with the chip or software, although it&apos;s worth noting that the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 is using last year&apos;s flagship GPU instead of the newer Adreno 750 on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 . </p>
<p>There&apos;s no expandable storage, but the phone has plenty of internal storage at 512GB, more than I know what to do with. The stereo speakers also sound pretty phenomenal on this phone, providing a deep, rich sound without the echo-y vocals I&apos;d normally hear on a Pixel.</p><p>Keeping the lights on is a 5200mAh battery, which manages to get the phone through most of the day, although if I unplug in the morning, I find myself having to charge the phone sometime during the evening. It&apos;s not a big deal, though, because the phone supports 100W wired charging, which tops up the phone pretty quickly. I wouldn&apos;t call speeds phenomenal, but I can get from 15% to full in about 50 minutes, and you still get a good amount of charge in about half an hour. There&apos;s also 66W wireless charging, although this isn&apos;t something I could test as none of my wireless chargers can reach nearly anything close to that speed.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bk3WfCQy9SmLP78CvHFUpK" name="Honor-200-Pro-review-06.jpg" alt="The Honor 200 Pro Control Center" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bk3WfCQy9SmLP78CvHFUpK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Honor 200 Pro runs the new MagicOS 8, which is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. As noted in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro review</a>, the UI is pretty identical to its predecessor and has a dual-pane control center that separates notifications from quick settings toggles for a cleaner look. However, as is the case for many new products launching in 2024, Honor is boasting some interesting software and AI tricks.</p><p>At the most basic level, there&apos;s the AI Suggestions widget, which will suggest a number of apps for you to open at any given time based on your usage patterns. It&apos;s not a novel idea, but it comes in handy. The Control Center also has a panel with AI-suggested toggles, which I find a bit handier sometimes when I need to turn on the flashlight, enable/disable the auto-rotate function, and more.</p><p>Then there&apos;s Magic Capsule, which looks and works similarly to Apple&apos;s Dynamic Island. The idea is that it&apos;s supposed to use AI to surface relevant information based on apps that are in use. It&apos;s a fun feature and a handy way to pull up the alarm, use a timer, or even interact with music. Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t go beyond basic tasks with system apps and seems to lack the deep integration with apps that Apple has (for instance, I couldn&apos;t get Maps directions to appear on the capsule). I imagine Honor plans to expand on this feature more, but for now, it&apos;s just a semi-useful addition.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K7iwTFBo88DiadmLxNjXN9" name="Honor-200-Pro-review-05.jpg" alt="The Honor 200 Pro Magic capsule showing a song playing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K7iwTFBo88DiadmLxNjXN9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the more useful features is Magic Portal, which allows you to drag and drop text and images into other apps via two invisible shortcut menus on either side of the display. This and the Global Favorites Space—which essentially takes a screenshot of your current screen and tucks it away in a hidden panel—are useful ways to make multitasking a bit easier, especially for someone like me who doesn&apos;t care much about using split screen. The idea is that you can easily drag and drop between devices as well, but this is something I could not test myself.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Pci6yxq33uY6pQvsWzyXbH" name="Honor-200-Pro-review-04.jpg" alt="Using the Magic Portal on the Honor 200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pci6yxq33uY6pQvsWzyXbH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor also makes it easy to extract text from images, which can then be used to jump into navigation, calls, or messages. In the Gallery app, Honor will automatically generate memories based on certain criteria like locations (not unlike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>), or you can create an Instant Movie using recommended images, turning your moments into a nicely curated slideshow.</p><p>Smart sensing will keep the screen on when I look at it, so when I notice the display dim while I&apos;m looking away, I can turn my head toward the phone, and the display will brighten up again.</p><p>One really cool feature is the Air Gestures, which is something like an evolution of the Air Motion feature on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-g8-review">LG G8</a>. With it, I can put my hand in front of the display, and the front-facing cameras will pick up specific gestures, allowing me to scroll, go back, or take a screenshot without touching the display. It&apos;s somewhat gimmicky, but it&apos;s a fun party trick and can be useful if your hands are dirty.</p>
<p>As for software updates, the Honor 200 Pro will receive three OS upgrades and four years of software updates, which is par for the course for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, although obviously behind the latest Pixels and Galaxy phones.</p>

<p>Honor took a very interesting approach to the camera on this phone, and it&apos;s taken some time for me to warm up to it. What&apos;s interesting about it is that the phone tends to really emphasize shadows and darker parts of the photo instead of trying to brighten them up as much as possible, like what you&apos;ll see with many other phones. The result is that images can sometimes appear to have too much contrast and not as much dynamic range. This can be minimized a little with HDR turned on, but it doesn&apos;t help all that much.</p><p>That said, color reproduction is pretty good and not overly saturated. It also handles low-light situations pretty well, although you&apos;ll want to toggle HDR for desired results.</p>

<p>The phone handles zooming and macro shots pretty well, thanks in part to the 50MP 2.5x telephoto lens and the 12MP ultrawide camera. Details are lost when zooming anywhere beyond, but it&apos;s not incredibly noticeable unless you zoom into the image after it&apos;s taken, and even scenes with a lot of detail are retained fairly well.</p><p>But where the phone really shines is portrait shots. Whether of people or objects, the Honor 200 Pro has a portrait mode that begs to be used to capture the most stylistic shots with very little work.</p>

<p>The phone comes with three different modes that you can toggle between for a different style: Harcourt Vibrant, Harcourt Color, and Harcourt Classic. The latter emulates Harcourt-style black-and-white images, enhancing both the highlights and the shadows for a dramatic shot. Harcourt Color has a similar effect while giving the image a warm, vintage feel, and it&apos;s personally my favorite of the three. Lastly, Harcourt Vibrant brightens things up quite a bit and is much cooler and more natural, albeit less dramatic.</p><p>When testing this out, I chose to stick with the 2.5x telephoto sensor.</p>

<p>When in Portrait mode, the phone does a good job at separating the subject from the background, although it can falter when there are too many people behind them. It also captures motion pretty well, and there were few moments when the subject came out blurry, although it may struggle a bit more at night.</p><p>You won&apos;t find 8K video on this phone, a downside of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3, but 4K60 is perfectly adequate and there are even some cool video modes that you can play around with. Selfies are also pretty decent, but don&apos;t count on portrait mode too much, as the bokeh doesn&apos;t feel as natural and the phone can have a little trouble separating the subject from the background.</p><p>Overall, the camera on the Honor 200 Pro is an interesting one, and if you&apos;re used to something like a Pixel, you may not like the results. However, for more artistic shots, I think the phone does an exceptional job.</p>

<p>The Honor 200 Pro is in an interesting spot where it&apos;s a flagship, but not quite. However, it still contends with flagship-level phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a>, which has a somewhat similar camera setup and fast charging speeds. Xiaomi&apos;s offering has a better IP rating and a better Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, although the battery is noticeably smaller than Honor&apos;s phone and starts with less storage.</p><p>You can always go for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus</a>, which also has a great triple-camera setup and is more accessible in North America. You&apos;ll find more in the way of AI features and longer software support with Samsung, although that all comes at a higher price. It, too, has a smaller battery and much slower charging speeds, plus a very forgettable design.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the Pixel 8 series, which is very camera-centric. Each model uses a flagship Tensor chip, although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> might be a more apt comparison given its triple camera system. This phone will give you all the AI features, years of updates, and the benefit of North American availability. The downside, like most other phones, is slower charging and a higher price point, which is where the standard Pixel 8 comes in, but with one less camera and weaker specs.</p>

<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>

<p>Portrait mode is often something I ignore on phones, because the results don&apos;t really stand out to me much more than the normal photo mode does. With the Honor 200 Pro, I actually have a reason to use the Portrait mode, which is something even the Pixel wasn&apos;t able to convince me to do. The approach to photos may be different than what you&apos;re used to with other phones, but it can result in some well-styled images with very little effort.</p><p>The phone teeters on the precipice of a premium midrange and a low-end flagship, offering specs that challenge even the best Android phones while compromising in some areas (but not many). Don&apos;t get me wrong; there&apos;s a lot to like about this phone, particularly when it comes to the camera. Honor clearly put a lot of love into this phone while trying to keep the price down. That said, while I really like the Honor 200 Pro, I don&apos;t find myself <em>loving</em> it. However, that won&apos;t stop me from recommending it if you&apos;re in a region where Honor sells the device, especially if you&apos;re someone who enjoys taking photos of friends and family.</p>

I tend to prefer IEMs with a neutral sound, but I will admit that the convenience that you get with wireless earbuds is unmatched.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>The key attribute of the CMF Buds is their accessibility; the earbuds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Buds-Cancelling-Waterproof-Headphones/dp/B0CXDGZ1WL">retail for just $39 in the U.S.</a>, and they&apos;re even more affordable in India, where they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/cmf-nothing-buds-42-db-active-noise-cancellation-ultra-bass-technology-35-5-hrs-playtime-bluetooth-gaming-headset/p/itmc68d1b79d6464">sell for ₹2,499 ($28)</a>. That&apos;s considerably less than the $99 retail price of the Ear 2, and you don&apos;t miss out on many features: the CMF Buds get fast pair, low latency mode, IP54 ingress protection, ANC, and Bluetooth 5.3.</p><p>Obviously, the Buds don&apos;t have the same see-through design that&apos;s distinctive to the Ear 2, but I think the design is eye-catching in its own right — particularly with the Clear Orange variant. The vibrant hue makes the earbuds stand out, and at 4.57g, they&apos;re light enough that you don&apos;t notice you&apos;re wearing them at all.</p><p>Nothing retained a similar overall structure as the Ear 2, so you get a bulbous shell and a short stalk. The shell has a glossy coat, but the stalk has a matte texture that makes it easier to trigger gestures. The fit is exquisite, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in this regard even with extended use.</p>

<p>The case is easily pocketable as well, and it has a dial that doesn&apos;t serve any utility; you just twirl it around if you&apos;re bored and want something to do. The build quality is decent, but the case has managed to pick up a <em>lot</em> of scratches in the two months I used the Buds — so in that sense, it is entirely too similar to the Ear 2.</p>

<p>Thanks to fast pair, you can connect the buds to your phone without any hassle whatsoever, and I got a stable connection with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-back-to-the-pixel-8-pro-and-i-couldnt-be-happier">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-reviewhttps://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-11-ultra-review">Zenfone 11 Ultra</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Magic 6 Pro</a>. The Buds integrate with Nothing&apos;s X utility, and you can tweak the sound profile, set up gestures, and change EQ modes with relative ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cF9pxUgRjLVxN9fBE9RnxJ" name="nothing-cmf-buds-7.jpg" alt="Nothing CMF Buds review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cF9pxUgRjLVxN9fBE9RnxJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And while I didn&apos;t use it as much, there&apos;s a low latency gaming mode that comes in handy if you&apos;ve got the Phone 2a or another Nothing phone. A big talking point is the presence of ANC, and it does a great job tuning out ambient noise. In my testing, it wasn&apos;t as effective as the Ear 2, but it is definitely useful if you&apos;re in a noisy environment.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QrpFLfB3vNYhx5rHCt35TH" name="nothing-cmf-buds-2.jpg" alt="Nothing CMF Buds review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QrpFLfB3vNYhx5rHCt35TH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I also like is that the Buds have a lot of extras that you don&apos;t usually see in this segment; there&apos;s IP54 ingress protection, multi-device pairing, and in-ear detection. The only downside to the design is that the gesture controls are still finicky, and that&apos;s been an issue on all Nothing earbuds I used up to this point.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dMdrSxCh8DwJ48bkYGaAFJ" name="nothing-cmf-buds-3.jpg" alt="Nothing CMF Buds review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dMdrSxCh8DwJ48bkYGaAFJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest reason to buy the CMF Buds is the sound quality, and there is a lot to like in this area. The earbuds have a distinctly bass-focused sound that delivers an energetic low-end — so much so that it spills over into the mid-range. The bass is heavy and domineering, but on the bright side, the earbuds sound fantastic with bass-heavy tunes. So if that&apos;s the sort of sound signature you&apos;re after, you should just get these; I liken the CMF Buds to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-2-pro-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 2</a> in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S4VfUrJaVFVi2vyHozaGqH" name="nothing-cmf-buds-4.jpg" alt="Nothing CMF Buds review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4VfUrJaVFVi2vyHozaGqH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you don&apos;t like the low-end to dominate the sound, you can tweak the sound signature (to an extent) via Nothing X, and doing so creates a slightly more balanced sound that lends itself well to most mainstream music. You don&apos;t quite get the same tonality or refinement as the Ear 2, but for what you&apos;re ultimately paying, the CMF Buds are among the best-sounding earbuds in this segment.</p>
<p>The CMF Buds are Nothing&apos;s most affordable earbuds yet, and while I haven&apos;t used the Buds Pro, I think the regular Buds are a great starting point into the brand&apos;s ecosystem. With Nothing set to announce a CMF-branded phone in the coming weeks, it is clear that the entry-level segment is where the brand sees the biggest differentiation. For now, if you need budget earbuds with a good design and bass-heavy sound, you&apos;ll like what the CMF Buds have to offer.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Creative doesn&apos;t have a huge presence in western markets, but it is a major player in Asia. The Sound Blaster series has a rich heritage of delivering standout audio products at a good value, and it started out making sound cards that could be plugged into a PCIe interface. I have fond memories of using the Sound Blaster X-Fi Fatal1ty sound cards back in college, and the brand has diversified into a host of new categories in recent years.</p><p>In what is a natural evolution, Creative makes Sound Blaster DACs these days, and the X5 is the brand&apos;s most ambitious offering yet. The X5 contains two Cirrus Logic CS43198 DACs and custom amps that allow it to effortlessly power any headset, including demanding planar options.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="F9TjSRfVpTEDnwsRkh7LmK" name="creative-sound-blaster-x5-2.jpg" alt="Creative Sound Blaster X5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F9TjSRfVpTEDnwsRkh7LmK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Sound Blaster X5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-External-Headphone-Bluetooth-Audiophiles/dp/B0BHYSCCH7">retails for $295 on Amazon</a>, and that puts it squarely in the range of most mid-range DACs sold by Chinese brands. I think Creative backed itself into a corner with the X5, because even though it has a lot of custom features that you don&apos;t get in other DACs, it doesn&apos;t quite measure up to its immediate rivals.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kmwKdJ669ByGZQBRpP7dmF" name="creative-sound-blaster-x5-3.jpg" alt="Creative Sound Blaster X5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmwKdJ669ByGZQBRpP7dmF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s evident in the design. The X5 has a plastic build and a front fascia that&apos;s <em>busy </em>with buttons and ports, with a large volume dial on the right. There&apos;s a screen that shows connection details and playback information, and you get dedicated 3.5mm and 4.4mm balanced connections alongside a mic in option that signals the brand&apos;s gaming-focused underpinnings.</p>
<p>You get toggles to adjust the gain, switch between PC and console, configure the EQ, DSP, and switch sources between the ports at the front and those at the back. There&apos;s even a knob to adjust the volume of the mic, and a mute button. Clearly, a lot of attention went into the feature-set of the X5, and it isn&apos;t lacking in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LrRkTQqqhwAgdzFxbKBXVG" name="creative-sound-blaster-x5-6.jpg" alt="Creative Sound Blaster X5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LrRkTQqqhwAgdzFxbKBXVG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, you get optical in/out, along with RCA in and out and USB-C as well as USB-A connectivity. What I like about the X5 is that it can be powered via the USB bus, so there isn&apos;t any need to connect it to an external power source. This versatility means you can use it with just about any device, and that&apos;s why there&apos;s a toggle to switch it to console mode up front.</p>

<p>And while the build quality is decent enough, the plastic chassis is noticeably light, and that&apos;s not what you want in a DAC. It doesn&apos;t feel as sturdy as other DACs, and Creative should have used a metal enclosure here — just like every other DAC manufacturer. Even $150 DACs like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k5-pro-review">Fiio K5 Pro</a> feel much more sturdy as a result, and although the X5 has rubber feet at the bottom, the unit moves around when you&apos;re connecting IEMs or headsets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eAGURqYXe8fAGsiQn8fb5J" name="creative-sound-blaster-x5-10.jpg" alt="Creative Sound Blaster X5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eAGURqYXe8fAGsiQn8fb5J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I connected the X5 to my Windows machine via USB-C, and I didn&apos;t see any issues in this regard. But what&apos;s annoying is that the volume knob is tied to the Windows volume, so if you manually change the volume in Windows, it doesn&apos;t translate to the device. To make things even more confusing, Creative doesn&apos;t show Windows volume on the panel, instead highlighting the decibel level. Ultimately, it just makes changing the volume convoluted than it needs to be.</p>
<p>When it comes to the sound quality itself, the X5 has a lot to offer. The DAC has a neutral signature and allows headsets and IEMs to shine, but this being Creative, you get adjustable EQ and a good selection of preset modes that change the dynamics of the sound to a significant degree. This isn&apos;t usually a feature you get on many DACs, but if you want easy configurability of the sound, the X5 has plenty to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sUAyi4YzmgwKtsVUPeaKZH" name="creative-sound-blaster-x5-9.jpg" alt="Creative Sound Blaster X5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sUAyi4YzmgwKtsVUPeaKZH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the X5 has Bluetooth connectivity, and there&apos;s a dedicated button that kicks the unit into pairing mode. Connecting via Bluetooth is about as easy as it gets, but the main issue in this area is that it doesn&apos;t have any AptX codecs or LDAC, so you&apos;re limited to SBC and AAC. Other Bluetooth-enabled DACs in this segment offer at least a few high-res codecs as standard.</p>
<p>The X5 delivers 313mW of power at 150Ω, and while that isn&apos;t as high as other DACs — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k7-review">Fiio&apos;s K7</a> goes up to 500mW at 300Ω — it is enough to drive just about any headset. On the whole, I didn&apos;t see any issues with the sound itself, and the customizability is a key differentiator.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="67po7Np3uM9YkwunQcE3iJ" name="creative-sound-blaster-x5-12.jpg" alt="Creative Sound Blaster X5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/67po7Np3uM9YkwunQcE3iJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, my current recommendation in the sub-$300 segment is the Fiio K7; there&apos;s a Bluetooth-enabled version of the DAC that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-K7BT-Bluetooth-Headphone-Amplifier/dp/B0C3HHCTJC">costs $249 on Amazon</a>, and it has a much better design with a metal chassis, sounds great, and includes all the connectivity options you want.</p><p>Overall, Creative got a lot right with the Sound Blaster X5, but by positioning it at the $300 mark, the brand essentially priced itself out of contention. With plenty of other options available at this price point, I don&apos;t really see why anyone would choose the X5 — unless you need a DAC that can be powered straight via the USB bus or want to use one with the PS5. Outside of these use cases, you&apos;re better off going with Fiio, Schiit, or SMSL.</p>

<hr>
<p>We’re nearing Samsung’s typical summer Galaxy Unpacked event, and we expect to see the company’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">new foldable phones</a> debut. There are a lot of leaks and rumors surrounding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/forget-rumors-this-is-our-closest-look-at-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-in-real-world">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and Galaxy Z Flip 6, including what features and changes might arrive soon. However, according to known leaker Ice Universe in a post on X (formerly Twitter), camera upgrades might not be coming on the Z Fold 6. If true, that would mean the brand-new Galaxy Z Fold 6 would ship with the exact same camera hardware as the two-year-old Z Fold 4.</p><p>That would be devastating news for fans of Samsung’s folding phones. Even when the Galaxy Z Fold 4 was brand new, it still lagged behind the company’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> in terms of camera hardware. For example, the Z Fold 4 and Z Fold 5 only support 3x optical zoom via the 10MP telephoto sensor. By comparison, the Galaxy S24 Ultra uses a periscope lens for 50MP, 5x optical zoom. </p><p>We’ve been waiting years for foldables to appear on the spec sheets and compete with their flagship counterparts. If this Ice Universe leak turns out to be accurate, users will have to wait beyond the Galaxy Z Fold 6 release. “All its camera specifications, including front camera, rear camera, UPC, and aperture value, are exactly the same,” the leaker claims. </p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seeing that many people still don't know the camera specifications of Galaxy Z Fold6.I'll emphasize it once,All its camera specifications, including front camera, rear camera, UPC and aperture value, are exactly the same, and there is no change.Exactly like Fold4 and Fold5.<a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1799271371832484148">June 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>Foldable phones already cost about double the price of a standard flagship. The regular Galaxy S24 costs $800, while the current Z Fold 5 costs $1,800. The high prices were acceptable in the beginning, but as we near the sixth generation of Samsung foldables, the bubble has to burst. Either prices need to come down, or hardware needs to match that of regular flagship phones.</p>
<h2 id="foldables-have-never-been-complete-phones-2">Foldables have never been complete phones</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qjoT7qHMLGmweQtVLSLssJ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-vs-google-pixel-fold-outer-displays-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the outer display size between the Google Pixel Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qjoT7qHMLGmweQtVLSLssJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the Galaxy Z Fold 6 doesn’t include major upgrades, it wouldn’t be the first time a foldable fell short of competing with regular flagships. In fact, that has been the norm since foldables were introduced, especially concerning those released in the U.S.</p><p>Last year’s Galaxy Z Fold 5 was virtually unchanged from the prior Z Fold 4, only adding a new hinge and a chip upgrade. It still has a narrow cover screen that makes it hard to use the phone when closed, and the cameras just don’t stack up to flagship cameras. It’s thick, too. There are quite a few compromises you make when picking up the Galaxy Z Fold 5, although you’re paying a lump sum to own one. </p><p>The Pixel Fold might just be worse. Google announced the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g2"> Tensor G2 chip</a> that powers the Pixel Fold in October 2022, and it was already half a year old when it debuted in the foldable phone in May 2023. The Pixel Fold only had the newest chip for about five months before Google replaced the Tensor G2 with an upgraded G3 version in October 2023. This is significant because Tensor G3 was bad in a lot of ways, from overall performance to thermal issues that caused overheating. And yet, if you buy Google’s most expensive phone today, you’ll get the aging Tensor G2 chip. </p><p>OnePlus did things a bit better with the Open, though it, too, had timing issues. Qualcomm announced the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform on the exact same day as the OnePlus Open became available. There wasn’t a single day when the OnePlus Open had the newest phone chip, even though it cost $1,700. Even though the rest of the OnePlus Open’s hardware is great, reports indicate we won’t get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a> this year. That means the OnePlus Open will drift further away from flagships until it receives an update.</p>

<p>People who buy foldable phones are enthusiasts willing to pay top dollar for a premium experience. By not doing everything they can to improve foldable hardware, tech companies are doing a disservice to their best customers. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="G6swk9EFhBuHpWY5CTxxR5" name="porsche-design-honor-magic-v2-rsr-16.jpg" alt="Porsche Design Honor Magic V2 RSR review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G6swk9EFhBuHpWY5CTxxR5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are consequences to companies’ approaches to foldable phones sold in the U.S. Stagnating innovation, driving people away from brands like Samsung and pushing them to others that provide a better experience. In a report covering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/global-foldable-market-share-q1-2024">Q1 2024 foldable phone shipments</a>, it was revealed that Huawei beat Samsung for the first time ever in moved units. Plus, competitors Honor and Motorola are finding success outside of China. </p><p>Samsung needs a big win to rebound and prove it’s still the leader in the folding phone market. We still don’t know what the Galaxy Z Fold 6 holds, and it’s entirely possible Samsung will surprise us with something outstanding. But if the leaks are right, it’ll be another underwhelming year for Samsung foldables. That might just push more people to buy traditional flagships again or look outside the North American market to get a better product. </p>
