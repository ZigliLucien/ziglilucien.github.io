Both the inner and outer displays are AMOLED with 120Hz refresh rates, and the FlexWindow also utilizes Samsung&apos;s Vision Booster technology so you can use the screen in any light. </p><p>Things are just as impressive under the hood, as the Galaxy Z Flip 7 boasts the powerful Exynos 2500 processor with all of the latest Galaxy AI-boosted software features. The phone also features seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed, and the 4,300mAh battery is the largest ever used in a Z Flip device.</p><p>The only problem is that the $1,099.99 price tag may put the Z Flip 7 out of reach for some folks, which is all the more reason why the T-Mobile deal above is so, so sweet. </p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-x2014-quick-links-2">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE July 8-11: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This year gave us an ultra-thin Galaxy Z Fold 7, a much bigger Galaxy Z Flip 7, and three new smartwatches. And that's not all, on the software front, these devices come packed with the latest One UI 8, backed by Android 16. This means new Galaxy AI features debut on these devices along with Wear OS 6 quirks! Without much adieu, let's unpack everything that was announced this year!</p><h2 id="galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-2">Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="soTr5M9upbEv8B8hMnHdZE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-mint-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/soTr5M9upbEv8B8hMnHdZE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This year, Samsung outdid itself with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, the clamshell shows up in an all-new look, sporting a larger screen space than usual. To begin, it sheds its usual folder-like camera bar for the largest ever edge-to-edge cover screen on a Galaxy Z Flip series.</p><p>It's a no-brainer that the 4.1-inch Super AMOLED FlexWindow will allow users to do more when right from its cover screen when the device is flipped shut. The Flip 7 gets a larger 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen and a 120 Hz refresh rate. Both the internal and external displays are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2.</p><p>As for its cameras, the Z Flip 7 gets a 50 MP wide and a 12MP ultra-wide lens, along with a 10 MP selfie shooter.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="iCiJNJyhNsZubA23MoZGA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-24" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Now Brief hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iCiJNJyhNsZubA23MoZGA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This time around, even with its foldables, Samsung wanted to take the word "slim" to the next level. With the Galaxy Z Flip 7, the Korean OEM promises a "pocket-sized AI-powerhouse." Measuring a compact 13.7mm when folded, the clamshell weighs only 188 grams. Aiding it to stay thin is Samsung's updated hinge mechanism, the Armor FlexHinge. The Korean OEM seems to be proving that powerful things can also come in small packages.</p><p>As sleek as it is, under the hood, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is powered by Samsung's recently revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500 SoC</a>, which will help run all the new Galaxy AI features that come with One UI 8 out of the box. These features include the new Now Bar and Now Brief, as seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series. </a>Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-more-in-store-android-samsung-unpacked">Gemini Live</a> swoops in on the cover display, bringing useful hands-free assistance for a range of topics.</p><p>This pocket-sized dynamite of a phone comes with a 4,300mAh battery, delivering "up to 31 hours of video on a single charge." The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is available in two storage configurations: 12/256GB and 12/512GB, and in three colorways: Blue Shadow, Jet Black, and Coral Red. The Mint is reserved for online purchases only. Preorders begin today, and it is set to hit stores on July 25, starting at $1,099.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-32" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hinges hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is flexing hard with its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> as it arrives as the thinnest and almost creaseless foldable yet. Measuring  8.9mm when folded and 4.2mm when unfolded. Despite its slender profile, Samsung says the phone is built to last everyday's wear and tear with a resturctured Armor FlexHinge and foldable display.</p><p>To keep its form factor this slim, the company has also ditched S-Pen compatibility with the phone, citing that the majority of Fold users don't really reach for the accessory.  The Z Fold 7 arrives with a much wider 6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x cover display that Samsung says has, 21:9 aspect ratio. Things get even better when the device is unfolded, with an 8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x screen that gets 2,600nits of peak brightness.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5333px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LeupYBjJLH3TukZ3DiV2X5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-Blue-Shadow-5" alt="Blue Shadow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LeupYBjJLH3TukZ3DiV2X5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5333" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's new foldable is powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>, which Samsung states will fuel its Galaxy AI features. When it comes to the device's triple camera array, the device gets the Galaxy Z series' first 200MP (wide-angle) primary lens, along with a 12MP ultra-wide and a 10MP telephoto lens. While the cover display and internal display both have 10MP selfie shooters.</p><p>The device brings the "Ultra" experience, even on the software front, it gets One UI 8 (Android 16), right out of the box. Galaxy AI on this larger screen device adds "AI Results view," which lets users do more, without needing to switch between apps. Drawing Assist, Writing Assist, and Drag & Drop help with multitasking on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. It's worth noting Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-more-in-store-android-samsung-unpacked">major AI announcement for Android</a>, which brings Circle to Search updates and an improved Gemini Live experience.</p><p>To keep things going for the user all day, the 4,400mAh battery setup, and the phone comes with three different storage options: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, or 16/1TB. The device shows up in three colorways for pre-order today (July 9), starting at $1,999 in Blue Shadow, Jet Black, and Silver Shadow.

Unlike the standard Z Flip 7, this model looks a lot like the Z Flip 6, retaining the folder-like cutout on its cover display, meaning you won't get the edge-to-edge cover screen on this one.</p><p>That said, Samsung keeps its smaller on the Z Flip 7 FE internally as well, with a 6.7-inch internal display and a 3.4-inch cover display. However, when it comes to the camera setup, it matches the flagship with a 50MP and 12MP dual array.</p><p>The Z Flip 7 FE is powered by an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">older Exynos 2400 SoC</a> from Samsung. Users will also find One UI 8's Now Brief support on the Flip 7 FE. Samsung used a slightly reduced 4,000mAh battery in the Flip 7 FE, and also a reduced storage configuration on this device: 8/128GB and 8/256GB.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is available for pre-orders today (July 9), starting at $899 in black and white.</p><h2 id="galaxy-watch-series-8-2">Galaxy Watch Series 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="yaBAzKc6XNGPRnjcjqAYTG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-24" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) next to Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yaBAzKc6XNGPRnjcjqAYTG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's get down to the wearables, shall we?

Choosing a phone color is relatively easier, but some might be stumped by this step as well. The simplest way to make a choice you won't regret is to get something that's your favorite color. And if you don't have a favorite, just go for the black option. There's a reason why black is a staple in fashion; it's a no-brainer whether you're buying clothes, shoes, phones, or smartwatches.</p><p>Our number one recommendation from this year's assortment is the Blue Shadow version of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. This deep blue has a mesmerising quality to it, almost resembling the deep, calm waters of the ocean at night or a classic pair of dark blue jeans. The shape of the Z Fold 7 looks rather striking in this coat of paint.</p><p>Fans of lighter hues should stick to the Silver Shadow option. There's no white variant of the Fold 7 this time around, but the silver color is a fitting replacement to appease those who delight in lighter shades.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There's still something to please everyone on the roster. Retaining the Jet Black colorway was the smartest move on Samsung's part since it's a basic shade that is a safe choice for most people.</p><p>Those who prefer a bolder, spicier paint job will be pleased with the Coral Red hue that we saw on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>. It's very reminiscent of the hot chilli red <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-9-review">ASUS Zenfone 9</a> variant that went over massively well with the crowds a few years ago. I will never get over that shade, which is why it brings me boundless joy to see a similar color on the Galaxy S25 and now the Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p><p>If you're not too bold but also tired of a plain black phone, Blue Shadow provides a healthy balance of both. It's not a plain Jane blue hue; the steely dark blue compliments the sleek profile of the Flip 7. Darker colors don't get dirty as easily as lighter colors and small scratches are less noticeable too, so you still retain the benefits of a darker shade like Jet Black.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Depending on what finish and drop protection levels you're after, picking the best Galaxy Z Flip 7 case is straightforward business. I don't recommend using your $1,500 phone without a case, especially since repairs on a foldable phone cost a fortune.</p><p>Regardless, my top choice will always be the ultra-thin Thinborne Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 600D Aramid Fiber Case. At 0.04 inches, it's mind-blowing just how slim and lightweight the Thinborne case truly is. The hefty price tag justifies itself several times over when you consider the quality and set of features you get. There's a tempered glass screen protector for the cover display included with the case. It's hard to believe the case also supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe and Qi2 accessories</a>.</p><p>Money might be an object of concern, in which case I have several cheaper recommendations that don't compromise quality. Spigen should be your go-to brand when looking for high-quality products on a tighter budget. The new Airfit Pro MagFit is highly robust, boasting military-grade drop-proofing, but it weighs next to nothing and hardly adds any bulk at all. Admittedly, the hinge is thick, but this is to defend the weakest link of the Flip 7.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's pretty much where the similarities end, as Samsung has packed the new generation with an upgraded, edge-to-edge cover display, some new hardware, and the lightest, thinnest frame of any Flip series phone to date. The battery is also larger than ever, plus you get all of the latest Galaxy AI software features with seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="FMDCXKz2GJ2bYHLk7G2s96" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-33" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FMDCXKz2GJ2bYHLk7G2s96.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="should-i-buy-the-galaxy-z-flip-7-or-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-2">Should I buy the Galaxy Z Flip 7 or Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE?</h2><p>Although we haven't been able to study the two phones side by side just yet, it's most likely going to depend on your budget and what you're looking for in a foldable phone. With a starting price of $899.99, the FE is a bit more affordable than the standard Z Flip 7, but the trade-off is a weaker processor and less battery life. Whether or not that's a dealbreaker is up to you, but I'd start by seeing how much you can save using one of the preorder deals above. Who knows, maybe the right deal could make this question completely moot.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Considering that the phone starts at a steep $1,999.99 (yes, really), I&apos;ll take just about any deal I can get. </p><p>After months of leaks and rumors, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> was finally unveiled this morning with an ultra-thin build, two stunning AMOLED displays, and all of the latest Galaxy AI software features. The innovative foldable phone is also powered by the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that drives the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, plus you get seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. So yes, it&apos;s pretty impressive, but do the specs justify a $2,000 price tag? It&apos;s tough to say, but I certainly wouldn&apos;t buy the phone without taking advantage of one of the following preorder deals first.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-quick-links"><span>Quick links</span></h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-live-blog-july-2025"><strong>Samsung Unpacked 2025 live blog: everything we learned</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hands-on review: A new hope</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7">Up to $1,100 off with eligible trade-in and new line</a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold7/buy/">Up to $1,000 off with trade-in, plus free storage upgrade</a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7.html">Up to $1,100 off with any trade-in and new line</a></li><li><strong>Best Buy:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7-512gb-unlocked-navy/6635727.p">Up to $1,000 of trade-in credit, free storage upgrade</a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0FDH65CBY">Get a $300 gift card and FREE storage upgrade</a></li><li><strong>Prime Day Samsung deals: </strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">discounted flagships, up to 50% off Galaxy Watch</a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-preorder-deals"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 preorder deals</span></h3><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ea0568d9-229e-4f59-b5fa-7260a6a79e30" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung: Up to $1,000 off with trade-in, plus free storage upgrade" data-dimension48="Samsung: Up to $1,000 off with trade-in, plus free storage upgrade" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold7/buy/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="B2FuqYxaZUEkHwVmgYdBUT" name="Samsung-Logo.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B2FuqYxaZUEkHwVmgYdBUT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="2048" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold7/buy/" data-dimension112="ea0568d9-229e-4f59-b5fa-7260a6a79e30" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung: Up to $1,000 off with trade-in, plus free storage upgrade" data-dimension48="Samsung: Up to $1,000 off with trade-in, plus free storage upgrade" data-dimension25=""><strong>Up to $1,000 off with trade-in, plus free storage upgrade</strong></a></p><p>Purchase the Galaxy Z Fold 7 directly from the source and you'll receive up to $1,000 of instant trade-in credit when you send Samsung an old or broken device.

While it's become more of an accessory than ever before, that doesn't mean I'm not intrigued when new alternatives arrive. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> series managed to pique my interest at just the right time.</p><h2 id="a-new-but-familiar-design-2">A new, but familiar, design</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="c8kF5dHXPFVajM3PdGPBTG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-23" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, 8 Classic, and Watch Ultra (2025) hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c8kF5dHXPFVajM3PdGPBTG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most obvious change here is that the squircle-like design introduced with the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is now found across all smartwatch models. So those hoping that Samsung would keep at least one traditional design around aren't going to be too happy.</p><p>That being said, I also wasn't a fan of the Watch Ultra's design at first, but after buying one and using it for a while, it grew on me. I'm not saying that will be the same experience for you, but I recommend giving it a shot before immediately dismissing it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="42No4oG3cJTS32UpTAMkWE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-folded-watch-8-hands-on-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 folded next to Watch 8 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42No4oG3cJTS32UpTAMkWE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This new design also brings about a couple of other major changes to the Watch 8 and 8 Classic, such as a slimmer and lighter design. Samsung says the Watch 8 is 11% thinner than the Watch 7, making it the "thinnest Galaxy Watch." And when I held the Watch 8 for the first time, even with the band attached, I couldn't believe how light it was.</p><p>Even the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, with its larger frame and extra hardware, felt a lot lighter than I expected. Seeing as I'm someone who prefers larger wearables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch/mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-review">TicWatch Atlas</a> or Galaxy Watch Ultra, I'm used to hefty chunks of aluminum and glass. The Watch 8 Classic didn't give me the same feeling, but it did feel like a watch that I could wear every day and occasionally forget it was there.</p><h2 id="the-rotating-crown-returns-2">The rotating crown returns</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PUZbnawgyRTkdAxkcStpQG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-16" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUZbnawgyRTkdAxkcStpQG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of the extra hardware, the rotating crown has returned to the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, and I couldn't be more excited. This is my favorite way of interacting with a smartwatch, and Samsung has essentially perfected the entire experience. As a side note, it turns out that the "tick-tock" nature of the crown is intentional, meaning that if the Watch 9 Classic rolls out next year, it likely won't have one.</p><p>There is one more design change, and it's not one that's specific to the Watch 8 Classic. Samsung has redesigned its band mechanism with the Watch 8 series, which came as a surprise to me. I actually liked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">previous mechanism</a> with the push button to retract the springs when swapping out bands.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ttcZtLRF2gmExaf6sfF3TG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-31" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch band connector comparison hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ttcZtLRF2gmExaf6sfF3TG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="anwLLKoLFE6u7HZtCx2jUG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-27" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch band connector comparison hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/anwLLKoLFE6u7HZtCx2jUG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uCcL7iunwDUR2hQiL4LzRG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-13" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Bands hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uCcL7iunwDUR2hQiL4LzRG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>However, there's now a "tongue" in the middle that inserts into the watch casing.

But it has the added benefit of providing a more snug fit while reducing the gap between the band and your wrist.</p><h2 id="new-health-features-2">New health features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="avKzaRLuUH2r392grnUjWG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-9" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic BioActive Sensors hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/avKzaRLuUH2r392grnUjWG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Switching gears to features that are actually new, the Watch 8 is the first smartwatch to include the ability to measure your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/samsung-announces-one-ui-8-watch-beta-program">antioxidant levels</a>. The process for doing so isn't as simple as tapping the screen and keeping your wrist in place. Instead, you actually have to take the watch off and push your thumb against the BioActive sensor.</p><p>I'm not sure if there's any other way Samsung could have done this, but I hope there's eventually a way to do so without needing to take off the watch. Nevertheless, once the reading is complete, you'll see the results on both your watch and in the Samsung Health app on your connected phone.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="e2XQUEGeVYWuj3GdMkZRJG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2XQUEGeVYWuj3GdMkZRJG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gSKvvYhBcttJiXNCsjUqHG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gSKvvYhBcttJiXNCsjUqHG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results with Samsung Health on Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Lastly, there is one feature that could "force" me to get the Watch 8 Classic or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Watch Ultra 2025</a> over anything else, and it's the software.

Such a design leads us to the "cushion" design that Samsung brought with the Ultra, where the circular watch face sits atop a square-ish base. Kicking things off is the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, which Samsung states brings "timeliness sophistication" with modern features.</p><p>The 8 Classic hits the market in one size, 46mm (1.34-inch display), and is available in black and white options for ~$500. However, it sports a "slimmer, brighter Classic screen." The post states the Watch 8 Classic's display should make consumers' viewing experience much better, meaning apps and things on it are easier to see. Additionally, the continuation of the rotating bezel makes scrolling (or twisting) through your apps a breeze.</p><p>Samsung also highlights a new "Quick Button" for "added convenience." The Watch 8 Classic sports a 445mAh battery, 2GB of memory, and 64GB of storage.</p><h2 id="motivation-for-health-2">Motivation for Health</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5333px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8hbaav4VVL6HDRJSzKNXBL" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-1" alt="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic White" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8hbaav4VVL6HDRJSzKNXBL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5333" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In celebration of the launch, Samsung's TM Roh, president and acting head of the device experience division, said, "By combining purposeful design with advanced sensor technology and an intuitive AI-powered experience, the Galaxy Watch 8 series serves as a starting point for a healthier, more connected life, making it easier than ever to take meaningful steps toward users’ well-being."</p><p>The first major feature is a new one, as Samsung details the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's "Antioxidant Index." For the first time, the company says users can measure their carotenoid levels "in just five seconds" to make more informed choices for a better lifestyle and healthier aging.</p><p>Samsung is pushing the sleep monitoring experience of its Galaxy Watch 8 series, stating users will find "tailored" sleep coaching tools, severe sleep apnea detection, and the ability to create an ideal sleep environment, so you're not tired the next day.</p><p>More than that, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic introduces several "unique" health-focused features, like Bedtime Guidance. Samsung says this feature will "measure your circadian rhythm" to help you identify the best time to sleep. Additionally, the Watch 8 Classic brings "Vascular Load," which is designed to help users understand their stress levels on their vascular system during the night.</p><p>High Stress alerts and a Mindfulness tracker help users record their mood and manage their stress throughout the day, and there is also a selection of breathing exercises, too. Runners will find a Running Coach and an updated "Together" function, which lets users bring their friends in for a game-like journey into fitness. Energy Score is backed by Samsung's AI, giving users a combined look into their daily energy.</p><h2 id="samsung-wear-os-and-gemini-2">Samsung, Wear OS, and Gemini</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hYpvMH6qr3aCU7PUmPoTSG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-15" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hYpvMH6qr3aCU7PUmPoTSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In tandem with Google, Samsung is bringing Gemini to its Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>.

The Samsung Health app, much like Calendar, Reminder, and the Clock app, is also available to utilize hands-free with Gemini.</p><p>Samsung's own One UI 8 Watch is also rolling out to the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. The company states the OS has been refined to fit the device's screen, bringing Multi-Info tiles and a watch variant of the Now Bar, prominently featured on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">the Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-2">The Galaxy Watch 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results with Samsung Health on Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Watch 8 model has been granted its thinnest build yet. Samsung says consumers will find the watch is roughly 11% thinner than its previous iterations. The company also implemented its new "Dynamic Lug" system, which helps the watch move with your wrist to increase its comfort levels and improve its overall fit when worn.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 is launching in two sizes: 40mm and 44mm. The post states users will find a 1.34-inch and a 1.47-inch Super AMOLED display, respectively, for these two sizes. Samsung highlights the Watch 8's 50% increase in brightness capabilities with a measurement of 3,000nits.</p><p>Design-wise, like the Watch 8 Classic, the base Watch 8 sports a cushion design, inspired by the Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p><p>Consumers interested in the Galaxy Watch 8 will find the same host of sleep and health/fitness features previously mentioned for the Watch 8 Classic. This includes the assistance of Google's AI, Gemini, and One UI 8 Watch (Wear OS 6). Internally, both devices sport the Exynos W1000 SoC. Samsung states its entry-level Watch 8 receives a 325mAh battery (40mm) and a 435mAh battery (44mm).</p><p>The Watch 8 starts at ~$360 (40mm) and ~$400 (44mm) for its Bluetooth version.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung highlights its 2025 Galaxy Watch Ultra model, which it touts as its "most advanced and durable" version. The watch features an IP68 rating for water resistance and a strong MIL-STD-810H durability rating for bumps and hard knocks. Samsung has also upgraded its 2025 variant with 64GB of storage paired with 2GB of memory.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra's battery life receives some TLC, as Samsung boosts it with enough power for "100 hours" of use. Many of the other features in the Galaxy Watch 8 series, such as Samsung Health, Gemini, multi-info tiles, and more, are present on the Watch Ultra.</p><p>Users can find this device starting at $649 (47mm) in an all-new Titanium Blue, alongside Titanium Gray and Titanium Silver.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Existentialism aside, the same is true with various companies and the devices they sell. That's exactly where Samsung ended up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, as its flagship foldable suite of phones has grown fairly stale over the three previous generations.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung finally traded in the hand-me-down robes for a brand new set of its own. And after being able to spend some time with it, I've come away feeling less confused than I did before.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is basically everything that I and others have been asking for. A thinner design with better performance and, more importantly, a camera system worthy of the phone's price tag. Although my initial time was limited, I feel fairly certain that Samsung has responded to those requests in a huge way.</p><h2 id="bigger-and-lighter-2">Bigger and lighter</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-28" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Fold 7 feels even more like a "do-it-all" device than before, thanks to the displays. The cover screen is wider, making it much more comfortable to use. However, it's also not too wide to the point where you feel like you have to play finger gymnastics.</p><p>The inner screen is also larger, which is great for multitasking, split screens, and, of course, better for playing games. More importantly, Samsung finally introduced a redesigned hinge that greatly reduces the "crater" found in the middle of previous models.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Qo36GJtpRpVaz2eVZgVrp3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Edge Panel hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qo36GJtpRpVaz2eVZgVrp3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="CneGaeRWyP32pucUawyw4" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-watch-8-watch-8-classic-hands-on-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, Flip 7, Watch 8, and Watch 8 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CneGaeRWyP32pucUawyw4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Speaking of which, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> are both getting upgrades to take full advantage of the larger inner display.

That's really my biggest takeaway after spending about an hour or so playing around with the Fold 7. I just can't seem to get over how thin it really is.</p><p>Even with the improved hinge and slimmer design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-one-year-later">Fold 6</a>, it still felt like I was holding a brick in my hand.

When unfolded, it almost managed to tuck between the front of the watch and the top of the band. Even when it's folded, the Fold 7 is just a smidge thicker than the Watch 8's casing but is thinner than the Watch 8 when accounting for the BioActive sensor.</p><p>That's not a knock on the Watch 8, but it is more of a testament to just how incredibly thin the Fold 7 really is. I mean, there's barely even enough space for the USB-C port, which feels like an engineering feat all on its own.</p><h2 id="thinness-comes-at-a-cost-2">Thinness comes at a cost</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="veWdUgwS3kJ9PykkDwLqXo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-z-flip-7-mint-hands-on-6" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/veWdUgwS3kJ9PykkDwLqXo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sadly, none of these changes would have been possible if it weren't for the sacrifices that were made. And it appears that many of the rumors got this one right, as Samsung removed the digitizer layer from the display. And in doing so, for the first time since the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-fold-review">Galaxy Fold</a>, you<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sheds-the-s-pen-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-for-super-slim-design"> won't be able to use an S Pen</a> with Samsung's latest book-style foldable.</p><p>Samsung informed us that this was simply due to the lack of people actually using an S Pen with previous Z Fold models. I can't help but wonder if this was due to people needing to pay another $50 on top of the $1,899 price tag of the Fold itself. Perhaps if Samsung included one in the box, like it does with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S lineup</a>, things would be different.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="JvAfuZ5ZbBavhxkAoNLfv3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 display crease and rear of phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JvAfuZ5ZbBavhxkAoNLfv3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another disappointing aspect of the Fold 7 is the battery, as we yet again have a 4,400mAh cell. Samsung claims that between One UI and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>, battery life will actually be better than its predecessor. I'm definitely not holding my breath on that one, but it will be something I test out during the review and beyond.</p><h2 id="some-final-thoughts-2">Some final thoughts</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="soTr5M9upbEv8B8hMnHdZE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-mint-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/soTr5M9upbEv8B8hMnHdZE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Quickly pivoting to the cameras, my eyes might be deceiving me, but it sure looks like the camera module is as thick as the Fold 7 itself. That's definitely not a complaint since we finally have an upgraded camera system, headlined by the 200MP primary sensor and joined by a 10MP telephoto and 12MP ultrawide. It's worth noting that the ultrawide sensor now features autofocus, allowing the Fold 7 to be used for macro photography.</p><p>In One UI 8, Samsung is leaning on its "Next Gen ProVisual Engine" to help make pictures look even better. I suspect results similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, at least from the main lens, but that'll have to wait until I get the Fold 7 in my hands.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-21" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 200MP camera mode hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xiNj9KkGFteFmspLSfqBv3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-17" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 pictures hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xiNj9KkGFteFmspLSfqBv3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ThupxSoDucssFoHNfMbG24" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-18" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 video comparison hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ThupxSoDucssFoHNfMbG24.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>There's a lot more to cover about the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but it just wasn't possible to do so during my hands-on.

The Flip 7 debuts with a larger 4.1-inch Super AMOLED display over its predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">the Flip 6</a> (and other iterations). Samsung highlights the display's edge-to-edge appeal, which throws out that old folder tab-like design, giving consumers a maximum amount of space to do whatever they need to.</p><p>Inside, the Flip 7 rocks a 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen, that's said to be "smooth and immersive." Building upon that is the phone's 120Hz refresh rate on its internal and external screens. Another notable design change is the Flip 7's slimmer 13.7mm build. Additionally, its "cover and back" are shielded by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2.</p><p>Helping the Flip 7 stay thinner this go round is Samsung's updated hinge mechanism, the Armor FlexHinge.</p><p>Interest in the Flip 7's cameras leads Samsung to detail its dual array, consisting of a 50MP Wide and a 12MP ultra-wide lens. The company says these "flagship quality" lenses should bring that level of clarity to every shot. Additionally, Samsung encourages users to check out its Nightography setting. Through this, the post states users can capture "vivid photos in low light."</p><p>Teased as a "pocket-sized selfie studio," the Flip 7 brings editing tools via Portrait Studio in Photo Assist. Moreover, you'll also have the ProVisual Engine there to back you up after every photo, optimizing them for clarity and bold colors. The selfie lens debuts at 10MP on the phone.</p><h2 id="the-flip-7-stands-tall-in-a-small-package-2">The Flip 7 stands tall (in a small package)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="v44XM8Y6Pt3BB6FNFco756" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-11" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v44XM8Y6Pt3BB6FNFco756.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under the hood, future Galaxy Z Flip 7 owners will find Samsung's recently revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500 SoC</a>.</p><p>This chip will have a lot of work to do, as Samsung highlights loads of AI software inside its newest clamshell phone. As you'd expect, courtesy of One UI 8, the Flip 7 features the new Now Bar and Now Brief, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">the Galaxy S25 series</a>. The Now Bar displays app activity in real-time, as well as boasting new third-party app support for users. Via the Flip 7's cover screen, the Now Bar can even display rideshare ETA and more.</p><p>For the Now Brief, users will find these personalized daily updates for traffic, reminders, and more. The Now Brief can also recommend videos and music based on your personal preference and available subscriptions.</p><p>Also, new in One UI 8's software, the Flip 7's cover display clock can "adapt and stretch" to your chosen background. The numbers can adhere to the contours of your photo, so it's never in the way, ensuring you can see both the time and your favorite photo whenever.</p><p>Potential Flip 7 users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-more-in-store-android-samsung-unpacked">will have access to Gemini Live</a> on their cover display, bringing useful hands-free assistance for a range of topics. Samsung also tossed in camera support for the Flip 7 in Gemini Live, so the AI can offer insights into your next outfit, yoga poses, and much more.</p><p>Getting you and your Flip 7 through the day will be a 4,300mAh battery, delivering "up to 31 hours of video on a single charge." Consumers will also find the following RAM/storage config: 12/256GB and 12/512GB. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is available for pre-order today (July 9) for $1,099 in Blue Shadow, Jet Black, and Coral Red—Mint is available online only. The Flip 7 will hit the general market on July 25.</p><h2 id="the-flip-7-fe-2">The Flip 7 FE</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="5awGSbNEyscXZbVmtjpnA4" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5awGSbNEyscXZbVmtjpnA4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Curious minds can rest easy now, Samsung has announced the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE. Unlike its flagship counterpart, the Flip 7 FE continues the folder tab-like cutout design over its external display's cameras, like the Flip 6. However, it matches the flagship Flip 7 with a 50MP and 12MP dual array.</p><p>Opening it up, consumers will find a slightly smaller 6.7-inch internal and 3.4-inch cover display. Included inside the device is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">older Exynos 2400 SoC</a> from Samsung. Users will also find One UI 8's Now Brief support on the Flip 7 FE, granting personalized suggestions daily.</p><p>Samsung popped a slightly reduced 4,000mAh battery into the Flip 7 FE, as well as the following RAM/storage config: 8/128GB and 8/256GB.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is available for pre-orders today (July 9), starting at $899 in black and white.</p><h2 id="galaxy-z-fold-7-sleek-strong-2">Galaxy Z Fold 7: Sleek & Strong</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5333px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LeupYBjJLH3TukZ3DiV2X5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-Blue-Shadow-5" alt="Blue Shadow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LeupYBjJLH3TukZ3DiV2X5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5333" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Closing Samsung's foldable reveal is the larger Galaxy Z Fold 7. Samsung's president and acting head of the device experience, TM Roh, commented about the device, saying, "Galaxy Z Fold7 combines Galaxy AI with powerful hardware to deliver our most advanced smartphone experience yet." As such, the Fold 7 features massive improvements to its build, as it slims down to 8.9mm when folded (4.2mm unfolded).</p><p>Quick glances at your Fold 7 will be done on its 6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x display. However, Samsung states users will notice one major difference: the cover display is wider. The company delivers a 21:9 aspect ratio on the Fold 7's cover screen. Opening it up, you'll find a colorful 8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x screen with up to 2,600nits of peak brightness.</p><p>Speaking volumes to its increased power levels is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>. Not only has the Fold 7 been powered up across the board, but Samsung states this chip will further fuel its AI efforts.</p><p>With a triple camera array, the Fold 7 provides access to the Galaxy Z series' first 200MP (wide-angle) primary lens. Complimenting this is a 12MP ultra-wide and a 10MP telephoto lens. The cover display rocks a 10MP lens, the same as its internal display.</p><h2 id="cameras-beyond-2">Cameras & Beyond</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-21" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 200MP camera mode hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like the Flip 7 series, the Fold 7 features Samsung's ProVisual Engine for photo optimization. On the side, users will find Night Video, capable of "separating moving subjects from still backgrounds to reduce noise." There's also 10-bit HDR support on the book-style foldable, enhancing the color depth in your captured memories.</p><p>Photo Assist brings AI-powered adjustments for your photos, in case something is out of place or in the way. Generative Edit and Audio Eraser come in as useful additions for Fold 7 users to quickly remove blemishes or sounds that would otherwise ruin a perfect shot/video. More importantly, Samsung says Fold 7 users can utilize side-by-side editing and Show Original to compare the first photo to your edits conveniently.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dCRgAQhcjbG28XCcx6NSw3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-10" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Google Gemini hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCRgAQhcjbG28XCcx6NSw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung furthers its AI presence on the Fold 7 through One UI 8 (Android 16), which is already on the device. One UI 8 is said to "combine" Samsung's intelligent models and its large-screen multitasking tools on the Fold 7, making a cohesive unit. Galaxy AI on this larger screen device adds "AI Results view," which lets users do what they need to while viewing what the AI has returned about their query.</p><p>Drawing Assist, Writing Assist, and Drag & Drop bring extra uses for convenience throughout the day when multitasking with the Galaxy Z Fold 7. It's worth noting Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-more-in-store-android-samsung-unpacked">major AI announcement for Android</a>, which brings Circle to Search updates and an improved Gemini Live experience.</p><p>The Fold 7 features a 4,400mAh battery setup. Internally, the foldable features the following RAM/storage config: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, and 16/1TB. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is available for pre-order today (July 9), starting at $1,999 in Blue Shadow, Jet Black, and Silver Shadow (Mint is available online only).

In the week leading up to Unpacked and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> unveiling, I spent some time with the Galaxy Z Flip 6, so I wasn't coming into it with no reference point.</p><p>After going hands-on with the Flip 7, my immediate impressions were surprisingly more positive than I expected. Despite only using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-one-year-later">Flip 6</a> for about a week, the Flip 7 seems like a massive upgrade.</p><h2 id="it-s-all-about-the-flexwindow-2">It's all about the FlexWindow</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="rUsKKPFxvJ7nnKUJfrfz4" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cover-screen-selfies-hands-on-2" alt="Selfie camera using cover screen on Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rUsKKPFxvJ7nnKUJfrfz4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most obvious reason why I feel this way has to do with the FlexWindow, which is getting supercharged. The screen itself is much larger, as it now wraps around the dual cameras that are still found in the bottom right corner, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>. We also have a bunch of new AI features, with the most notable being the ability to access Gemini and Gemini Live without opening the phone.</p><p>Not only that, but like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, Samsung is bringing the Now Bar and Now Brief features from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> to the Flip 7 with One UI 8. And there's even a Now Brief button that appears in the opposite corner of the dual cameras. Samsung also explained that while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a> works with Google and Samsung apps, it's working with partners to bring even more apps into the mix.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3rMQU8KgQ43uU5kF4B7B56" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-21" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Now Brief hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3rMQU8KgQ43uU5kF4B7B56.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="aNhV6pGS28zbYjMd8Xbo76" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-17" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Google Gemini Cover Screen hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aNhV6pGS28zbYjMd8Xbo76.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="obbkK4e4hbDGaVLsLB8366" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-20" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Google Gemini Cover Screen hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/obbkK4e4hbDGaVLsLB8366.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Customization is just another layer that Samsung is improving, with things like auto-curated wallpapers. And if you're tired of the clock widget hiding the face of a loved one on the FlexWindow, it's been updated to adapt and fit around the subject. I can't really help but feel like Samsung took a page from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/everything-apple-stole-from-android-and-wear-os-at-wwdc-2025">Apple and iOS 26</a>, but it's still a welcome addition.</p><p>The last thing that I want to mention about the FlexWindow isn't all that great. Samsung spent a lot of time talking about all of the functionality being added, which is wonderful, but you still can't use any app without <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">Good Lock and MultiStar</a>.</p><p>I'm genuinely curious and confused as to why Samsung didn't make this one of the defining features of the Flip 7. It would've been the best time to do so, given the expanded cover screen. And while the other new features are more than welcome, it just feels like a missed opportunity.</p><h2 id="exynos-replaces-snapdragon-2">Exynos replaces Snapdragon</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="DuJAb8juw4oqbdoMCin956" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 home screen main display hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DuJAb8juw4oqbdoMCin956.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the FlexWindow isn't the only attraction of the Flip 7, as the main display has also been improved. It sports a 6.9-inch Dynamic 2X AMOLED panel, with Samsung opting to make it a bit wider than the Flip 6, with the company pointing out that the Flip 7 is almost as wide as the Galaxy S25 Plus.</p><p>While the upgrades are definitely welcome, I was pretty surprised to learn that the Flip 7 will <em>not</em> be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>.

Normally, smaller phones would get second-rate specs because manufacturers couldn't fit all the big-boy cameras or most powerful processors into a smaller package, but that wasn't the case with the Pixel 9 Pro. It had everything the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL did, all at a better price and a pocket-friendly size.</p><p>While we expect Google to announce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-release-date">Pixel 10 series</a> sometime in the next month or so, all the rumors point to the Pixel 10 Pro selling for at least $1,000 when it debuts.

Manufacturers accelerated their launch schedules, and it feels like the year has been a never-ending cycle of phone launches. That's good news if you're looking to upgrade your phone, with plenty of great options available.</p><p>I used well over 40 phones until now in 2025, including all the major Android releases in the budget, mid-range, and flagship segments. My go-to recommendation is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>; OnePlus did a fantastic job with the phone, and it has flagship-level cameras, a bright AMOLED panel, and outstanding battery life. The best part is that it's down to $499 on Amazon and Best Buy right now, a $100 discount from its usual retail price.</p><p>If you need clean software and the best AI software utilities, then the Pixel 9a is what I'd suggest in the mid-range category. It has a modest discount, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Gemini-Smartphone-Incredible/dp/B0DVHV7X53">bringing it down to $423 on Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9a-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6612957.p?skuId=6612957">Best Buy</a>. You get great cameras, a vibrant OLED panel, Google's best software features, and Android 16.</p><p>If you're ready to switch to Google's best cameras, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is what I'd recommend; it is my favorite Pixel right now, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-XL-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HV78PT">coming in at $749 on Amazon</a>, you're getting a huge $350 discount. This deal is close to selling out, so if you've decided on the phone, I'd suggest getting it as soon as possible.

But if I had to buy a phone in 2025, it would be the OnePlus 13R. It delivers the best performance, has the best battery life, and a vibrant AMOLED panel with good software customizability.</p><p>I don't like the new iterations of OxygenOS as much as the legacy builds, but I'll admit the software has good fluidity, and it looks modern. And with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/">phone down to $499</a>, you're getting a terrific value. It outshines all other phones in the $500 to $700 segment, and if you need a reliable phone that looks good and holds up incredibly well in daily use, you should just get the OnePlus 13R.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Not only do you get a universal adapter to plug into any socket in the world, but you can also plug in multiple cables simultaneously to recharge your tech.</p><p>My go-to travel adapter has been constant for two whole years.

There are two USB-A and one standard USB-C ports, as well as a second Type-C port where the retractable cable resides.</p><p>The retractable cable gets 68cm or 2.2ft long and is made of highly durable nylon braided material. Its flat linguini-like shape prevents tangles and snags. As an added bonus, cats and dogs find it hard to nibble and break nylon braided cables such as this one.</p><p>I found the plug locks to be sturdy, and they stay put when set. Some travel adapter prongs tend to have loose springs, but clearly Baseus made sure the quality was up to par with this adapter. Like most of the brand's charging gear, the EnerCore CG11 is well-made and sure to last a long time.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

That’s about to change, as an upcoming update is adding a search bar, making it way easier to track down the exact image you need without endless scrolling.</p><p>As per a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/photo-picker-search-bar-rolling-out-3574489/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google is giving Android’s Photo Picker an overhaul with a handy search feature to help you find pictures faster. On top of that, a new date scrubber is in the works, so scrolling through endless photos will be a whole lot easier.</p><p>The Photo Picker is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-photo-picker-gains-cloud-media-app-support">all about keeping your privacy intact</a> by letting you pick just the photos, GIFs, or videos you actually want to share, without handing apps full access to your entire gallery.</p><p>Unlike the old system, it puts you in control, cutting the risk of apps snooping through your personal stuff.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.00%;"><img id="rvH2VdtexyUtjWpSNA4eMA" name="Photo-picker-search-bar" alt="new search bar in Android photo picker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rvH2VdtexyUtjWpSNA4eMA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the Photo Picker is great at keeping your pictures and videos private, let’s not pretend it wasn’t missing some basics. Top of the list, for example, is the lack of a search bar.</p><p>If you’ve ever had to dig through a mess of random images just to find that one screenshot, you know the struggle. That’s why finally getting a search tool feels less like a new feature and more like a long-awaited fix.</p><h2 id="gradual-rollout-2">Gradual rollout</h2><p>Google seems to be quietly rolling out the new Photo Picker search feature to a small group of users. Once it hits your device, you’ll spot a new search bar sitting right above the Photos and Collections tabs. It works kind of like the basic search in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, with just a quick way to find shots of certain people or scenes without digging forever.</p><p>Tap the new search bar, type in a keyword, and you’re looking at the photo you need.

The 6000mAh battery easily lasts two days between charges, and the camera takes better photos than last year. The switch to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 unlocks much better performance, and you get 256GB UFS 4.0 storage on the base model. The software is much more optimized this time around, and you don't get the same fluidity on any other phone in this category."</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> You want the best hardware package available in the mid-range segment today.

The panel now has a 2K resolution (2780 x 1264) with 120Hz refresh, and it gets bright — I didn't have any issues using it outdoors under intense heat.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset ensures the phone handles anything you throw at it; there wasn't any issue with overheating even while playing demanding games, and I didn't see any slowdowns in regular use. The cameras are just as good as the OnePlus 13, and while you miss out on some versatility, you get terrific photos and videos.</p><p>Thanks to the 6,000mAh battery, the phone lasts up to two days between charges. And it has 55W charging, with the battery taking less than an hour to charge — that's less time than the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>OnePlus did a better job with the software as well, and while there's still overt customization, it looks modern, and you get plenty of useful features.

Each offers a refined experience built atop Sony’s latest micro-OLED panels, delivering what the company calls a “4K-like” display.</p><p>According to the company, the Luma series is 50% sharper than its previous offering, the VITURE Pro. Meanwhile, The Beast is set to be VITURE’s most advanced pair of XR glasses.</p><p>The new baseline Luma is actually cheaper than the Pro, but punches above its price. For $399, you’re getting 1200p resolution (yep, even higher than Pro), 50° FOV, and the same 1000 nits of brightness. Myopia adjustments go up to -6.0D. It’s shipping in September.</p><p>Next is the VITURE Luma Pro, and it will be available for $499. It has the same 1200p display and 1000 nits, but the Luma Pro steps up with dynamic light effects and a built-in front RGB camera (just waiting to be unlocked after launch). You also get size options (regular/large) and magnetic charging.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2tRMWqb7EBDatQ2XRFY9oe" name="Viture-Luma-Pro" alt="Black Viture Luma Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2tRMWqb7EBDatQ2XRFY9oe.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">VITURE Luma Pro </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: VITURE)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="luma-ultra-goes-full-ar-2">Luma Ultra goes full AR</h2><p>For the power users and enterprise folks, VITURE is rolling out the Luma Ultra in August for $599.

It's called the Pexar, and it's available in a 11-inch size. While I used the Nest Hub in the past as a photo frame, Google made the product unusable in recent months, so I needed an alternative.</p><p>What I like about Lexar's offering is that it has an anti-glare touchscreen, and that makes all the difference. The panel has a 2000 x 1200 resolution along with good color vibrancy and contrast, it comes with 32GB built-in storage, and the 11-inch size is ideally suited to showcase photos. The best part is that it doesn't cost much; it retails for $129, but you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/pexar-Resolution-Ultimate-Anti-Glare-Stunning/dp/B0DB1BM71Q">pick it up for $110 as part of Prime Day savings</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6f4699f5-c9c4-4a96-ba39-7fe3ce448d72" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Pexar has a high-quality 11-inch 2K resolution panel with an anti-glare coating, and with 32GB built-in storage, it holds thousands of photos.

The bezels are relatively thin, it's easy to transfer photos to the device, and it has built-in storage.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need smart assistant integration.</p><p>The Pexar is straightforward to set up and use; it uses the Frameo platform, and you can easily connect it to your phone to transfer photos. The free plan is limited to sending 15 photos at once, so I just plugged in a USB-C drive to the back of the unit and transferred thousands of photos in a matter of minutes.</p><p>The design is elegant, and the bezels around the panel aren't as thick as other photo frames. The 2K resolution (2000 x 1200) is adequate, and 32GB built-in storage means you can easily store thousands of photos; I transferred over 2,000 images to the frame, and it only took up over 3GB of storage. If you have a sizable media library, you can always slot in an SD card.</p><p>The software is minimal, and you get a decent set of options around managing slideshows of albums. You can also set a schedule so the frame automatically turns off at night, get weather notifications, and set up a clock. The touchscreen is fluid and there's no lag while using the interface, and the anti-glare panel makes a decent amount of difference.</p><p>If you need a digital photo frame or are looking to gift one, the Pexar is a great overall option, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-SAFAVIEH-Luxe-Collection-Runner/dp/B0C9H54GLX">$110 makes it a good Prime Day deal</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

What's new and improved is the emoji-style display on its "face" that can be used to emote or communicate with family members or friends.</p><p>While the EBO Air 2 launched at a super reasonable $219.99 launch price, it has become much cheaper now thanks to this Amazon Prime Day deal.

It attaches magnetically to the back of a phone — so you'll need a magnetic case if you're using an Android phone — and there's even a USB-C port that lets you charge a second device at up to 20W.</p><p>The PicoGo magnetic power bank usually costs $35, but it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Card-Size-Magnetic-Lightweight/dp/B0DYJY2MKS">now down to just $24 for Prime Day</a>, which is a terrific price. This is one of the best magnetic power banks around, and if you need a portable option you can take anywhere, it's the one I'd suggest — it's now my go-to choice while out and about. Prime Day is in full swing, and if you're interested in other tech, be sure to take a look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20">all the deals live now</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="59dc5755-4c93-43c2-814a-5531d5c6ea2f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The PicoGo has a metallic chassis that's built to last, and the magnetic power bank securely attaches to the back of your phone.

The PicoGo is astonishingly versatile thanks to a USB-C port in addition to the magnetic connector.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a bigger power bank. In that case, I'd suggest getting the 10,000mAh variant of the PicoGo, which has Qi 2.

And at 0.3 inches, you won't even notice it while it's attached to your phone. The design is a clear point of differentiation, and the build quality is fantastic — I used this power bank for the better part of two months now, and it has been rock-solid.</p><p>It has good charging efficiency as well, and I didn't have any issues charging a variety of Android phones as well as my iPhone 16 Pro Max with the power bank. The added USB-C port makes it convenient to charge a second device.</p><p>Basically, the PicoGo has everything you need if you're looking for a reliable power bank that you can take anywhere.

In fact, I'm using it right now as I write this.</p><p>It's not too large and is quite lightweight, making it easy to throw into a bag or hold by the included strap, which is a nice touch. I have the black colorway, but I really like the orange. But of course, it's really about the sound.</p><p>The ULT Field 1 is an impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speaker</a> that produces very loud sound, making it perfect for outdoor gatherings, especially in the summer. I bring it to gatherings pretty often, and while it can't hold a candle to larger stereo speakers, this definitely gets the job done.</p><p>And if you really wanna party, that big ULT button on top seriously amps up the bass, which may be too much for solo listening but is perfect for lively gatherings where people just want to dance. The 12-hour battery life also ensures that you'll be dancing all night long, and the IP67 rating means you can enjoy it at the pool or in the shower.</p><p>Seriously, I love this thing, and I expect many others do, too, hence the 4.6-star rating on Amazon.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-2">Prime Day 2025 Android deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories" target="_blank">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets" target="_blank">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches" target="_blank">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><em><strong>ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

You don't have to worry about exposing it to the elements outdoors since it sports a robust IP67 water and dust-proof rating. There's a companion app with an equalizer to tweak the sound, but you probably won't need it much anyway because this speaker sounds phenomenal out of the box. It's a great portable audio solution in a luxurious body.</p><p>Although there's no Auracast support on the model, you can stack two or more of these speakers to create a stereo pair. And with a deal this cheap, you can easily grab two of these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">excellent speakers</a> from Marshall. It'll double the fun and deliver synchronized audio that sounds sublime.</p><p>I was very pleased with the battery life on Emberton II while testing it. Once you're done with 30 hours of playback, you can quickly recharge it back thanks to fast charging via USB-C. And yes, Marshall includes a Type-C cable in the box.</p><p>The leather finish and metal knob look and feel uber premium. For less than $100, this is the best audio accessory Prime Day deal I've seen so far!</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Nothing has changed my opinion that these are the best earbuds that runners or cyclists can buy.

Shokz gave the OpenFit 2 stronger magnets to guarantee charging, tactile buttons for easier on-the-run controls, and a better design, and it seriously paid off.</p><p>My only complaints about the Shokz OpenFit 2? There's no Find My option if the case falls down a couch cushion, and Shokz doesn't warn you if your case is running out of juice, so the earbuds stay at low power. My advice is to buy the Beige OpenFits so that they're easier to find, and just remember to charge the case every once in a while!</p><p>Otherwise, the Shokz OpenFit 2 is my daily running companion, and I'd be thrilled to buy them for this price.

At 5.8mm, it's currently Samsung's thinnest flagship phone, but the company had to make some compromises to get there.</p><p>For starters, the battery is 1,000mAh smaller than the unit in the Galaxy S25 Plus. Additionally, unlike the Galaxy S25 Plus, which features a triple camera system that includes a 3x telephoto lens, the Galaxy S25 Edge has only a two-camera system. Sure, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-camera-review">the 200MP primary camera is certainly impressive</a>, but nothing beats the versatility of a dedicated telephoto lens.</p><p>However, as far as thickness goes, during my time using the Galaxy S25 Plus, I never once thought to myself, "I wish this phone were thinner." At 7.3mm, the phone already looks sufficiently thin and, frankly, feels excellent in hand.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4099px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="mLqS6nAPQoY8AH8jLyXbMW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-01" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Plus outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mLqS6nAPQoY8AH8jLyXbMW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4099" height="2306" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is why I think the Galaxy S25 Plus is the better buy for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday">Prime Day</a>.

Sorry, Costco, but I can buy paper towels in my bathrobe this way, while saving some money, too.</p><p>Here's what I bought that isn't super interesting but needs to be factored in so I can tally up my total savings:</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0F2Q4NH47/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3UIOU5FPYQZHT&psc=1" target="_blank">600 Dandelion seeds for $6.39 from Amazon</a>.

But this new model will probably cost the same as the current model ($649). Unless you're flush with cash, you should probably use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Amazon Prime Day</a> to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartwatch-Wellness-Tracking-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YL96ND"><strong>Galaxy Watch Ultra (2024) for $324.99 ($325 off!)</strong></a> while it's still available.</p><p>Once the alleged 2025 model launches, Samsung may remove the current Watch Ultra from store shelves to prevent cannibalizing its sales with the old version. But for now, it's clearing out all the remaining stock it has, and I doubt the price will fall any lower than this all-time low.</p><p>Considering the 1.5-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> will probably cost $330 or more — plus an additional $50 for cellular — getting the Watch Ultra LTE for the same price is a pretty epic upgrade.

I've been using the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 for several weeks now and while I love it, I don't think there's enough of a difference between it and last year's model to justify the price.</p><p>That's especially true on Prime Day when the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JBK6PG"><strong>is $300 less</strong></a> than the 2025 version. Even though you'll be saving $300, you'll still be getting the same great Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 processor inside as the 2025 model, the same excellent OLED displays with great eye care settings (including an option to disable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> entirely), and the same amazing outer display you can run <em>any</em> app on.</p><p>In fact, the cameras are all the same 50MP spec, you get the same amount and speed of RAM and storage, the same size battery, and the same great Moto software. Truly, there's very little reason to pay extra, even without this Prime Day deal.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d45e6af5-e8d0-4328-98d3-3da1ba0fa3ec" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $799.99" data-dimension48="Was: $799.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JBK6PG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="znCGGT5zMeoWnypVRNhjQW" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-render-spring-green-4.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/znCGGT5zMeoWnypVRNhjQW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Motorola Razr Plus 2024 📨</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JBK6PG" target="_blank" data-dimension112="d45e6af5-e8d0-4328-98d3-3da1ba0fa3ec" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $799.99" data-dimension48="Was: $799.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$799.99</del></a></p><p><strong>Starting at:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JBK6PG" target="_blank"><strong>$699.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><em>"The Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is an impressive phone that continues to set the standard for other flip phones.

If you're a beach bum or just tend to drop your phone in dirt, it might be worth it to spend the extra $300 or grab one of the many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-best-motorola-razr-razr-plus-razr-ultra-2025-deals">Motorola Razr Plus 2025 deals</a> from your favorite carrier.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2025 gets one additional year of promised Android updates, stopping at Android 18, with security updates through the end of 2029. The 2024 model stops at Android 17 with security patches through the end of 2028. That's all great if you're planning to hold on to the phone for more than the next four years.</p><p>Other than that, there's not much to speak of. Pantone color validation for the Razr Plus 2025's cameras is quite nice, but it's not worth the extra cash, according to my testing. I'd say just save the $300 now by buying the Razr Plus 2024 and upgrade a few years down the road when Motorola gives the series a huge spec bump.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

I was impressed by just how much technology was packed into this small ring, and Oura continued to improve it by adding more features.</p><p>The same has been true for the Oura Ring 4, which arrived with a better sensor layout, an enhanced algorithm, and even better battery life. The ring is capable of automatically tracking heart rate data when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/can-oura-ring-4-automatically-detect-workouts">automatically detecting activities</a>, and Oura has worked to make step counts and other data more accurate than ever.</p><p>I've also found the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-rolls-out-its-ai-powered-personal-trainer">Oura AI advisor</a> very helpful, as it uses my data to inform me on how I can improve my sleep or readiness. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-can-now-track-meals-and-glucose-parameters-for-us-users">meal tracker</a> also utilizes AI to log your food; simply point a camera at it, and it will automatically identify what you ate and how your meal timing regularly contributes to your overall health. It's all very intuitive, and given Oura's tendency to add more features, I feel it makes the $6/month subscription all the more worth it.</p><p>Of course, you can also opt for last year's Oura Ring Gen 3, which remains a great device and offers many features found in the Oura Ring 4.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f7c2ae1d-8d28-42b7-86f8-f4dbc6a36dcb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Oura Ring Gen 3 launched in 2021 for $299, but with the new and improved Oura Ring 4 available, you can now purchase this model for just $249, which is $50 cheaper than its original launch price." data-dimension48="The Oura Ring Gen 3 launched in 2021 for $299, but with the new and improved Oura Ring 4 available, you can now purchase this model for just $249, which is $50 cheaper than its original launch price." data-dimension25="$249" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRC9JP5/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="pxSbe7Q7pa4NpBK8BN8ryg" name="oura-ring-heritage-gen-3-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pxSbe7Q7pa4NpBK8BN8ryg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Oura Ring Gen 3 launched in 2021 for $299, but with the new and improved Oura Ring 4 available, you can now purchase this model for just $249, which is $50 cheaper than its original launch price.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSRC9JP5/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f7c2ae1d-8d28-42b7-86f8-f4dbc6a36dcb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Oura Ring Gen 3 launched in 2021 for $299, but with the new and improved Oura Ring 4 available, you can now purchase this model for just $249, which is $50 cheaper than its original launch price." data-dimension48="The Oura Ring Gen 3 launched in 2021 for $299, but with the new and improved Oura Ring 4 available, you can now purchase this model for just $249, which is $50 cheaper than its original launch price." data-dimension25="$249">View Deal</a></p></div><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-37">Prime Day 2025 Android deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories" target="_blank">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets" target="_blank">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches" target="_blank">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><em><strong>ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

But one unwelcome change is to the price: It costs $350 and up, a $50 jump compared to the Watch 7. And since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YNVD88"><strong>Galaxy Watch 7 is $159 (47% off) on Amazon</strong></a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Amazon Prime Day</a>, it'd be pretty crazy <em>not</em> to look at the last-gen option.</p><p>Based on the official specs, the Galaxy Watch 8 has the same 3nm Exynos processor, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, BioActive health sensors, connectivity standards, and durability rating as the Galaxy Watch 7.</p><p>The Watch 8 does have some new perks, like a 1mm-skinnier case, 1,000 extra nits of brightness, and a very small increase in battery capacity (about 25mAh). But otherwise, all the main differences come from the new Wear OS 6 update, which the Watch 7 will get later this year!</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5a2e468b-6604-4eac-b59d-959c4759efc0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="also Galaxy Watch 7 44mm: was $329" data-dimension48="also Galaxy Watch 7 44mm: was $329" data-dimension25="$159.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YNVD88" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="iEibk5Cnay9wE9TRFYsvS6" name="Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iEibk5Cnay9wE9TRFYsvS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>also Galaxy Watch 7 44mm: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQ3MML" data-dimension112="5a2e468b-6604-4eac-b59d-959c4759efc0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="also Galaxy Watch 7 44mm: was $329" data-dimension48="also Galaxy Watch 7 44mm: was $329" data-dimension25="$159.99"><del>was $329</del> <strong>now $199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>We've had the Galaxy Watch 7 ranked as the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a> for the past 12 months, beating out Google Pixel, Garmin, OnePlus, and other brands for its combination of fast performance, solid battery life, and four years of software support.

Unfortunately, it's also <strong>$499</strong>, which is hard to justify when the Watch 7 offers the same core experience for $159!</p><p>The main reason to choose the Watch 8 is if you don't want to wait for One UI 8 Watch, which will deliver new AI insights like Vascular Load, Antioxidant Index, and a Running Coach, plus new tools like a Now Bar. The Watch 7 will receive these before the end of 2025, though, so if you can be patient, you should hop on this last-gen deal instead.</p><p>There are other great Android watch deals like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Watch-2R-Smartwatch-Bluetooth/dp/B0DFVMNVV3"><strong>OnePlus Watch 2R for $172 (25% off)</strong></a> if you want to prioritize multi-day battery life over better sensors, durability, and software updates.

Google Maps ventures into the Garmin smartwatches via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.garmin.com/apps/f140ff7f-d19e-49f1-b851-01c7e0009d6c">company's Connect IQ Store</a>.</p><p>The latest addition gives users directions right on their wrist with turn-by-turn on select Garmin watches, including Venu, Forerunner, Vivoactive, and Fenix products. Users interested in trying out the feature will be able to put their destination on Google Maps on their connected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphone</a>, and the app will then send notifications to their Garmin smartwatch — further giving directions on when to take turns while they are walking, running, or cycling, for example.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qgPSTktNHARzCuttwE4jUd" name="Google-maps-Garmin-integration-01" alt="Google Maps on Garmin" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qgPSTktNHARzCuttwE4jUd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="sczd6NhaVNbuyp8voGNbVd" name="Google-maps-Garmin-integration-03" alt="Google Maps on Garmin" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sczd6NhaVNbuyp8voGNbVd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="9v27qp3BnjLfSRL2xhvjUd" name="Google-maps-Garmin-integration-02" alt="Google Maps on Garmin" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9v27qp3BnjLfSRL2xhvjUd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>“Whether exploring a new city, mapping out a run, or casually cycling with friends, the Google Maps app in the Connect IQ store will keep users going in the right direction.

I say vote with your wallet and get something that not only costs less than most options but also gives you a mountain of great games at the same time. I'm talking, of course, about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>.</p><p>The Meta Quest 3S is the wallet-friendly version of the Meta Quest 3, packing in the same powerful chipset and Quest 3-exclusive games, all without the high price tag.

That 128GB model comes with $45 worth of <em>shiny rocks</em> to use in Gorilla Tag, plus a special armor set for your ape avatar.

Before you start, I recommend ensuring that you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-adjust-eye-distance-ipd-meta-quest-3s">set the lens spacing properly</a> to provide the best comfort; otherwise, you could get tired eyes after a short while.</p><p>All Meta Quest 3S consoles come with 3 months of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-plus-subscription">Meta Horizon Plus</a> gaming subscription for free.

The S25 Ultra is also powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor (widely considered to be one of the best chipsets in use today), plus you get a ton of Galaxy AI-boosted software features and 12GB of RAM. And like the rest of the S25 lineup, the Ultra guarantees seven years of OS and security upgrades.</p><p>Indeed, the biggest problem with the S25 Ultra is its price. With a starting price of $1,299.99, the phone is simply out of reach for most folks without a good deal attached.

Amazfit best fits the bill for combining quality with low prices, and as the site's Wearables editor with years of experience wearing them, I can point you to the two best deals: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Balance-Fitness-Composition-Bluetooth/dp/B0C7GGYS7M"><strong>Amazfit Balance for $129 (35% off)</strong></a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Premium-Fitness-Resistant-Sapphire/dp/B0DT3YMDMZ"><strong>Amazfit Active 2 (up to 23% off)</strong></a>.</p><p>Although my colleague absolutely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfit-balance-2-impression" target="_blank">loves the Amazfit Balance 2</a>, which still costs $299, putting it in the same realm as true smartwatches.

And in that case, I'll point you to the Amazfit Active 2: It's a lighter option with a 1.3-inch, 2,000-nit display, more stylish steel bezel, and a next-gen PPG for more accurate HR data, while still costing less! You do lose days of battery life and the rotating crown, but it's a fair trade for the lower price.</p><p>The best price is the standard Active 2 for $84.99 (15% off), but if you upgrade to the Active 2 Premium ($99, 23% off), you get sapphire glass, contactless payments in Europe, and a second leather strap with the normal silicone one.

The A9 Plus includes a larger, 11-inch LCD display than the base model, and Samsung upgraded this generation with an improved Snapdragon 695 CPU. While it's nothing too special, this is about as good as tablets get around this discounted price point.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime Day deals on other Samsung Galaxy devices</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$219.99" data-dimension48="$219.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF3VPMV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="rUNyvTLboDppMEkJGRiNGo" name="Samsung-Galaxy-A9-Plus-screen.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rUNyvTLboDppMEkJGRiNGo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF3VPMV" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$219.99" data-dimension48="$219.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$219.99</del> <strong>$132.99 for Amazon Prime Day</strong></a></p><p>Prime Day has officially arrived with a ton of <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/prime-day-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">Samsung Galaxy deals</a> in tow, such as this offer that cuts 40% off the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus.

It showed a constant slideshow of all my recent and favorite Google Photos so I could reminisce every time I stepped foot into the kitchen, but its other function slowly became impossible to use: Google Assistant.

As an Android tablet, it's pretty much the perfect tablet for almost everything. But it really flexes its muscles when attached to the included Charging Speaker Dock, transforming it into a supercharged smart home display." — Andrew Myrick for Android Central</p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review"><strong>Android Central review</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2</a></p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're a casual tablet user who loves seeing their photos displayed in an elegant way, want a great smart home control center, and enjoys using the power of Gemini all without having to look for their phone. Pair it with the dock to turn it into an excellent speaker system, too!</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're a power user who spends lots of time on your tablet or absolutely needs top-tier performance. The Pixel Tablet isn't slow by any means, but it doesn't have ultra-high-end specs.</p><p><strong>Alternative deal 🪙:</strong></p><p><strong>OnePlus Pad -</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Display-MediaTek-Dimensity-Cellular/dp/B0C4FYBKHH/"><del>$479</del> <strong>$329 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><strong>TCL NXTPAPER 14 -</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-NXTPAPER-14-Paper-Like-Multi-Window/dp/B0F62PWNM1/"><strong> </strong><del>$399</del><strong> $319 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-tablet-11-android-tablet-128gb-wifi-porcelain/6578701.p?skuId=6578701" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a7797e44-7cf8-417e-960f-70de23e31601" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $399.99" data-dimension48="Was: $399.99" data-dimension25="$">View Deal</a></p></div><p>While I'm annoyed that Google doesn't include the Pixel Tablet Dock in the box, there's no denying the value that a $250 Pixel Tablet represents. Like I said before, at least the price savings on the Pixel Tablet makes up for having to buy the dock separately, and you still end up saving $30 in the end.</p><p>When it's not docked, you'll notice that this is a tablet made for human hands. It's got reasonably sized bezels that give your thumbs a place to hold it and a soft touch back that's grippy, even with wet hands. Too many tablets try to make the bezels tiny and give it a shiny plastic or glass back, which is just plain stupid in my opinion.</p><p>Not only that, but the Pixel Tablet's display is superb in every way. It's nice and bright, has excellent colors and contrast, and doesn't use nasty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> like Google's Pixel phones do. In other words, it's everything I'd love to see from a Pixel! Plus, all the little Pixel touches and regular updates always make it fun to pick up on a random whim.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R7xtfuLqcktmvkDwWpiE3U" name="google-pixel-tablet-smart-home-controls" alt="The Google Pixel Tablet with a smart home controls widget on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R7xtfuLqcktmvkDwWpiE3U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My three favorite features are some the same things I loved from my Nest Hub — that's the Google Photos screensaver and easy smart home controls — plus the ability to use Gemini instead of Google Assistant. I've unplugged all but one of my Nest speakers at this point because Assistant has become so darn unreliable, but Gemini has been a champ and the perfect replacement for Google Assistant in my home.</p><p>Aside from Gemini just plain working better for smart home controls and other queries, it's also smarter and can understand complex commands. That's particularly nice when I want to turn off specific lights and adjust the thermostat at the same time instead of having to issue separate commands one at a time.</p><p>And did I mention how good the audio is from the dock? It would make my Nest Hub blush if the thing still worked (which it doesn't). This dock's speaker doesn't feel like some convenience compromise; it feels like a proper audio system that works to fill the room with quality audio and actual booming bass. Overall. I couldn't ask for a better Nest Hub replacement, especially since you can <em>remove</em> it from the dock and turn it into a normal Android tablet.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

In fact, some of the people that I played the speaker for found the bass <em>too</em> intense. But let's face it, this is a beach and party speaker, so that's probably what you're going for. The further you stand away from the speaker, the less in-your-face the bass feels.</p><p>It's not just the speaker's tuning, however. Compared to the Beats Pill, the SoundLink Plus has a more full sound across the entire soundstage. While you might notice it most when listening to pop, hip hop, or R&B, you can also hear the difference across genres like alternative, jazz, and indie.</p><p>Listening to the SoundLink Plus sounds like I'm bringing my desktop speakers with me in a more compact form, whereas the Pill is more like an upgrade over my smartphone speakers. They both get the job done, especially while out and about, but the Bose SoundLink Plus makes the most of its bigger size.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cBaMQgN2mFtPoKHc35b8XZ" name="Bose-SoundLink-Plus-vs-Beats-Pill-10" alt="The back side and USB-C ports on the Bose SoundLink Plus (black) and the Beats Pill (red)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cBaMQgN2mFtPoKHc35b8XZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The SoundLink Plus sounds better than the Pill at all volumes, but it was shocking just how much louder Bose's speaker can get than the Beats option. I tested both speakers listening to the same tracks at 50% volume back-to-back, and the Pill was incredibly quiet. I'd probably need to crank the Pill up to 80-100% volume to fill a room, and the SoundLink Plus sounded like more than enough with the volume at 50%.</p><h2 id="portability-is-up-for-grabs-2">Portability is up for grabs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xPHG2Ap9p6WJ92LBXm6qxZ" name="Bose-SoundLink-Plus-vs-Beats-Pill-7" alt="The speaker grills of the Bose SoundLink Plus (black) beside the Beats Pill (red)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xPHG2Ap9p6WJ92LBXm6qxZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's tough to say which speaker is better for portability. The natural choice would be the Beats Pill, as it weighs about 1.5 pounds. The Bose SoundLink Plus is more than twice as heavy at 3.4 pounds, though it doesn't feel as bad in the hand. In terms of design, the Pill slightly tilts the audio drivers upward — toward your ears for a better listening experience — whereas the SoundLink Plus is shaped more like a rectangle.</p><p>The reason I like the SoundLink for portability has to do with its lanyard loop. It has a built-in "utility rope loop" that's shorter than the one on the Beats Pill but is much more durable. In this case, I think Bose's shorter and thicker loop is more useful than Beats' thinner and longer one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="byyppLJk6iUohTPWmJfQ8a" name="Bose-SoundLink-Plus-vs-Beats-Pill-6" alt="The Bose SoundLink Plus (black) and its utility rope beside the Beats Pill (red) and its lanyard loop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/byyppLJk6iUohTPWmJfQ8a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I grew up near a beach town, and I could totally see people using a carabiner to clip the SoundLink Plus to a bike, beach chair, or backpack. It's rugged enough to handle that, and the shorter loop means the speaker won't swing as much as the Beats Pill would if used in a similar load-out. On the other hand, the Pill is small enough to slot into a water bottle holder, so both have advantages depending on your everyday carry.</p><p>Luckily, you get IP67 certification with both speakers, so you'll have sand and splash protection for your days at the beach.</p><h2 id="bose-has-the-better-app-and-buttons-2">Bose has the better app and buttons</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xoRUQdoDHxtVstFJYkENzY" name="Bose-SoundLink-Plus-vs-Beats-Pill-5" alt="The controls on the Bose SoundLink Plus." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xoRUQdoDHxtVstFJYkENzY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The SoundLink Plus addresses one of the Beats Pill's biggest flaws — the Pill has an awful set of hardware buttons. There are two many purposes tied to the same button — the power button is used to turn the device on and off, check battery life, and initiate pairing mode. It's too much to keep track of, and it's frankly a frustrating experience.</p><p>Switching to the SoundLink Plus was like a breath of fresh air in this regard. There are six hardware buttons that handle all the functions you'd regularly need, making for little confusion. This simplicity alone made the Bose speaker feel more premium and handy than the Beats one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5gKQYt8K2uvAL8jakxm28Z" name="Bose-SoundLink-Plus-vs-Beats-Pill-4" alt="The controls on the Beats Pill (red) with the SoundLink Plus partly in the frame." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5gKQYt8K2uvAL8jakxm28Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Neither speaker has an outstanding companion app, but the Bose app at least adds an EQ function and lets you manage multi-source pairing.

They're all <em>just fine</em> — great for on-the-go use, but I'd never go out of my way to listen to them. It made me wonder, would a more expensive speaker like the Bose SoundLink Plus actually add enough value to be worth $120 more than those starter options?</p><p>After testing the SoundLink Plus for a few weeks, I came away massively impressed. To me, paying around $270 for a portable speaker is still probably a bit too much. As a budding audiophile, I'd rather invest in my main audio setup before branching out into premium portable options.</p><p>However, it's clear to me that the SoundLink Plus really is $120 better than speakers like the Beats Pill. It sounds sharper, fuller, and louder while having a better build and controls. If you have the money to spend or simply want to invest in a speaker for portable and at-home use, the Bose SoundLink Plus is a great option.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e9809c51-2938-4ae1-ae74-0082b77f6ffa">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SgsXKgfXSYuoAw3cWa5wMZ.jpg' alt="The Bose SoundLink Plus in black in a white product render."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Bose SoundLink Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A premium speaker</strong></em></p><p>With booming bass and a 20-hour battery life, the Bose SoundLink Plus is a big upgrade for people who need a portable speaker.

For me, that starts with the Viture Pro Mobile Dock <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-smart-glasses-that-work-perfectly-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-and-all-your-favorite-systems">which I tested</a> to work with the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>You can't plug <em>any</em> pair of smart glasses directly into the Switch 2 because Nintendo locked down the USB-C port, but the Viture Pro Mobile Dock can decode Nintendo's nonsense and let you play on a giant OLED on the go. Thankfully, the Viture Pro Mobile Dock is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Compatible-PlayStation-Supports-Handheld/dp/B0D3LT6BJW/"><strong>on sale for $109</strong></a> during Prime Day this year!</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-controller">Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate Controller</a> does something similar for your favorite smartphone games, and it works perfectly with streaming services like GeForce Now and Xbox GamePass. I played hours of Monster Hunter Wilds with this controller and Viture smart glasses, all without breaking my neck by looking down at a a handheld gaming PC. That one's on sale for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-8BitDo-Ultimate-Mobile-Gaming-Controller/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ/"><strong>10% off</strong></a> during Prime day.</p><h2 id="why-choose-viture-luma-over-viture-pro-2">Why choose Viture Luma over Viture Pro?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LpjbcN8KXcTJZpyhbH9j3Y" name="viture-luma-pro-with-box-and-case-02" alt="A pair of Viture Luma Pro smart glasses inside their blue felt-lined case, next to its box and a Viturist sticker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LpjbcN8KXcTJZpyhbH9j3Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sure, it's hard to pass up a $150 off deal, but some people just want the latest and best. That's what Viture Luma Pro is. They sport the latest Sony micro-OLED displays with 1200p resolution. That's an upgrade over the 1080p resolution of Viture Pro. Viture Luma Pro also sports a 52-degree FoV, making the display wider and more viewable than Viture Pro's 46-degree FoV.</p><p>Viture also upgraded the comfort options on Viture Luma Pro, with a new magnetic nose piece rest that's easier to swap out, plus arms that adjust to three different settings to better fit your face. That ensures you won't have any problem finding the clear sweet spot, and DC dimming for the OLED display ensures that even most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitive</a> users feel comfortable using these.</p><p>Aside from that, Luma Pro has a built-in camera up front that can be covered if it bothers the people around you. While the camera doesn't do much right now, Viture is planning to add 3DoF tracking in a future update, making them feel similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-pro-and-xreal-eye-deliver-a-new-vision-for-smart-glasses">Xreal One Pro</a> smart glasses at $200 less than Xreal charges. Of course, you'll have to wait an undisclosed time for that feature to make its debut, so while it might be a better value down the road, these glasses don't do what Xreal does out of the box <em>today</em>.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eAUTgvEXWWuNfPFXx3Sfxk" name="viture-luma-pro-vs-viture-pro-front" alt="Comparing Viture Luma Pro (left) with Viture Pro (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eAUTgvEXWWuNfPFXx3Sfxk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rzbcBsFMrSXesVsZeFDR2m" name="viture-luma-pro-vs-viture-pro-lenses" alt="Comparing Viture Luma Pro (left) with Viture Pro (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rzbcBsFMrSXesVsZeFDR2m.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d2J7tqWGeRVn5kp2dE26zk" name="viture-luma-pro-vs-viture-pro-top" alt="Comparing Viture Luma Pro (left) with Viture Pro (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d2J7tqWGeRVn5kp2dE26zk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D9YauHyERPYb8m8ZXBTrxk" name="viture-luma-pro-vs-viture-pro-magnetic-connector" alt="Comparing Viture Luma Pro (left) with Viture Pro (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D9YauHyERPYb8m8ZXBTrxk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MmEHoq6QPiCrPWJjavCsxk" name="viture-luma-pro-vs-viture-pro-side" alt="Comparing Viture Luma Pro (left) with Viture Pro (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MmEHoq6QPiCrPWJjavCsxk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>But let's be real, until that camera update comes out, there's not much of an upgrade here for most people to care about. Viture Luma Pro uses the same birdbath-style lenses as Viture Pro, the same excellent magnetic connector, and the same compatibility with the full Viture ecosystem.</p><p>If you end up loving Viture's fit, you can always grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Multi-screen-Assistant-12GB-256GB/dp/B0DRVPMT4T/">Viture Pro Neckband</a> — <strong>on sale for $173 off</strong> — to get a full computational experience on the go without having to hook your glasses up to a smartphone or other device. That lets you easily watch movies on a plane without wires hanging everywhere, and it even lets you play many Android games natively for a few hours.</p><p>Better yet, the Neckband supports PSPlay, so you can game on your PS5 wirelessly without hogging the TV. That's a lot better than the PlayStation Portal, if you ask me! If I'm choosing a pair of Viture glasses today, I'm grabbing the Viture Pro for $150 off and using that savings to grab one of Viture's other excellent add-ons to get a fuller experience for less money.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

I had no trouble passing through airport security in three different countries with the little battery in my bag.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3709px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SUaSdew48BxqcdGb52aVGL" name="INIU Pocket Rocket P50 Power Bank" alt="INIU Pocket Rocket P50 Power Bank" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SUaSdew48BxqcdGb52aVGL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3709" height="2086" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="efFJeFoCqVpLfkPJSxb3WL" name="INIU Pocket Rocket P50 Power Bank" alt="INIU Pocket Rocket P50 Power Bank" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/efFJeFoCqVpLfkPJSxb3WL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3693px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="A8mhnf4oFKwrxc9s9zQcLL" name="INIU Pocket Rocket P50 Power Bank" alt="INIU Pocket Rocket P50 Power Bank" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A8mhnf4oFKwrxc9s9zQcLL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3693" height="2078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>This adorable little power bank comes in a wide range of fun colors.

The brand rolled out several updates over the course of 2025, bringing exciting utilities to its NAS systems. The result is that the brand's NAS portfolio is among the strongest around.</p><p>The 4-bay DXP4800 Plus in particular is a standout offering; this NAS server is powered by Intel's Pentium Gold 8505 platform, has 8GB of RAM, a 128GB integrated SSD, two M.2 slots, 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet along with 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity.</p><p>Basically, it is the most powerful NAS server in its category, and right now, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB">buy it on Amazon for $519</a>, a $180 discount from its usual selling price. That may not seem like much, but these NAS models don't usually go on sale, and this is the lowest the DXP4800 Plus has been after its introduction.

With powerful internals and 10 Gigabit connectivity, the DXP4800 Plus isn't going to be obsolete anytime soon. You also get rock-solid build quality, good software with the ability to switch to TrueNAS, and two M.2 SSD slots.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want the best software pre-installed. While it has plenty of flexibility, the software isn't quite the best around. If you don't want to install TrueNAS and just need something that has better feature-set out of the box, you'll need to get the DiskStation DS923+.</p><p>The DXP4800 Plus has sturdy build quality thanks to an all-metal chassis, and it doesn't take up that much room. You get four drive bays at the front that accommodate up to 28TB drives each, and there are dual M.2 slots. It has 8GB of RAM installed out of the box, and you even get a 128GB SSD that houses the software.</p><p>The UGOS Pro software is at a point where you get the basics with relative ease; you can install Plex media server, back up data, and stream content without any issues. As it has a powerful Intel platform, you get hardware-accelerated transcoding in Plex — if you're on the paid Plex Pass — and with Docker container management, you get to install just about any service you want. And if you don't like the look of the software, you can switch to TrueNAS Scale.</p><p>The 2.5 Gigabit port in addition to the 10 Gigabit connectivity is frankly overkill, and I didn't see any problems with the NAS in the six months I used it. This is the most powerful NAS server in the sub-$800 segment, and the fact that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB">you can buy it for just $519</a> is amazing; you're getting a terrific value.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The brand's unique design philosophy combined with its focus on delivering a great value allowed it to carve out a niche in markets like India, and that's no small feat.</p><p>Nothing is now aiming to emulate the same with the Phone 3, a flagship that's designed to go toe-to-toe with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, Xiaomi 15, and the Pixel 9. At the outset, there's plenty to like with the phone; it retains Nothing's design ethos, and you get a new Glyph Matrix pattern at the back with better usability.</p><p>The software is among the best of any phone you'll find in 2025, with Nothing delivering a clean interface that's vibrant and playful — just like the hardware design — along with useful additions like Essential Space.</p><p>But the biggest downside has to do with the hardware; the Phone 3 misses out on Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and is instead powered by the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, a mid-range platform seen on devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f7-review">POCO F7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/iqoo-neo-10-review">iQOO Neo 10</a>. It isn't just the chipset either; you don't get many of the features available on Chinese rivals, like IP69 water resistance.</p><p>Combine all of that with the $799 asking price, and the Phone 3 isn't anywhere as good a value as its budget-focused siblings. Don't get me wrong, it is still a great overall phone, but it just isn't worth the price — not when there are better alternatives available.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3-specs-pricing-and-availability"><span>Nothing Phone 3: Specs, pricing, and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="TQiFSdmEJBhA67hNDMF5PR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TQiFSdmEJBhA67hNDMF5PR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing unveiled the Phone 3 at a launch event in London on July 1, and the phone is now up for pre-order, with availability starting July 15.

In the U.K., the Phone 3 is sold at £799 ($1,088) for the 12GB/256GB model, and £899 ($1,224) for the 16GB/512GB variant. In other parts of Europe, you'll need to shell out €799 ($937) to get the 12GB/256GB model, and €899 ($1,055) for the 16GB/512GB configuration.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Nothing Phone 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.67-inch 120Hz OLED, Gorilla Glass 7i, 1,600 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Nothing OS 3.5 based on Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, Adreno 825, 4nm node</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB UFS 4.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.7 OmniVision OV50H, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP  f/2.7 ISOCELL JN5, 3x optical zoom, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/2.2 ISOCELL JN1 wide-angle</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>50MP ISOCELL JN1, 4K60 video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, Dual-band GPS, AptX HD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,150mAh silicon-carbon battery (5,500mAh in India), 65W USB PD charging, 15W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>160.6 x 75.6 x 9mm, 218g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>White, Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3-design"><span>Nothing Phone 3: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pctuFpho5MmEA2vPS77iVR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pctuFpho5MmEA2vPS77iVR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The Phone 3 gets a new design, but it still maintains the Nothing ethos. </strong></li><li><strong>The highlight is a new LED dot matrix grid at the back that's highly customizable. </strong></li><li><strong>The phone is heavier than its rivals, but still has a good in-hand feel. </strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Phone coverage</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13 review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13 review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro review</a></p></div></div><p>The Phone 3 showcases the evolution of Nothing's design language; while it isn't as flamboyant as its predecessors, it still retains the same ethos — and it's just as distinctive.

Resultant shots have good color balance and detail, and they're not overly saturated. Foliage is rendered well, and there isn't any aggressive smoothing. The phone does really well in low-light scenarios as well, producing vivid images with little to no visible noise.</p><p>The tele lens is good in its own right, delivering usable shots at up to 6x. It doesn't quite have the same tonal balance as the main camera, but it is a decent showing nevertheless. The main camera does well with portrait shots as well, but you don't get the same level of bokeh as other phones.</p><p>While the Phone 3 has the best camera package of any Nothing phone, it doesn't measure up to its Chinese rivals. The Vivo X200, X200 Pro, Xiaomi 15, Find X8, Find X8 Pro, and OnePlus 13 all outmatch the Phone 3 when it comes to taking photos and videos, and Nothing still has some ways to go before it can hold its own in this area.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3-software"><span>Nothing Phone 3: Software</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="W39GgQ6ddTnKkcYWfabNRR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W39GgQ6ddTnKkcYWfabNRR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Nothing OS 3.5 has a clean interface with bold colors and unique widgets. </strong></li><li><strong>The software is fun to use, and it is one of my favorite skins. </strong></li><li><strong>The phone isn't launching with Android 16. </strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Related links</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF Phone 2 Pro review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2 review</a></p></div></div><p>Nothing has one of the best software interfaces of any Android phone currently available.

It costs less, has better internal hardware, and you don't miss out on any of the extras. The software isn't anywhere as good — I much prefer Nothing OS 3.5 to OxygenOS 15 — but it has good fluidity. You also get a bigger battery, better cameras at the back, and a brighter AMOLED panel.</p><p>If you're in a country where the iQOO 13 is available, that device is my go-to recommendation. It excels at the basics, and while the design doesn't stand out, you get incredible hardware and battery life, and the software is pretty good — if not on the same level as the Phone 3. Where the iQOO 13 shines is the value — there just isn't another phone that gives you as much for your money.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-phone-3-should-you-buy-it"><span>Nothing Phone 3: Should you buy it?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5084px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WB5TwAh7WTsyuh8txznEBR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WB5TwAh7WTsyuh8txznEBR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5084" height="2864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You want a phone with a distinctive design</li><li>You prioritize software over hardware</li><li>You want a phone with good battery life</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You want the fastest internals</li><li>You need the best cameras</li><li>You want a true flagship</li></ul><p>The fact that Nothing managed to launch a phone with this level of sophistication is an achievement in and of itself. The Phone 3 has a unique design, great software with fun widgets and AI utilities that you'll actually use, and cameras that are much better than any other Nothing phone until now.</p><p>However, it just isn't worth the asking price — not when there are more capable alternatives available. At the end of the day, that's the biggest limiting factor with the Phone 3; it isn't a bad phone by any measure, but it doesn't stand out meaningfully against other flagships.</p><p>I get that Nothing isn't chasing specs and instead trying to differentiate the Phone 3 with a bold design and clean software, and that is evident when using the device. Although it doesn't have the best hardware, the Phone 3 is fluid in daily use, it delivers good photos and videos, and lasts all day. But the OnePlus 13 and iQOO 13 do the same, and ultimately, they're a better value.</p><p>If you like what Nothing is trying to achieve with the Phone 3 and don't mind some of the omissions, then you should get the device — it is a refreshing change of pace from other phones I tested in 2025. But if you want a true flagship, you'll need to look elsewhere.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5f3507d6-2b4a-4311-a8f0-a0537282dcc3">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YePoe5yoNNw8rzpgquX8dY.jpg' alt="An official product render of the white Nothing Phone 3"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Phone 3 isn't anywhere as good a value as previous Nothing phones, but if that isn't an issue, you're getting a great package. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

One of OnePlus's marketing points was that it was the first phone in the U.S. with an IP69 rating, something even the Galaxy S25 family didn't include when it launched a month later. But what does that really do for you?</p><p>Last week, I read a story about a OnePlus 13 that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/someone-accidentally-tried-drowning-the-oneplus-13-and-it-didnt-flinch">ended up in a river for four and a half hours</a> without taking any damage, so I figured I would put it through my own test by taking the phone on the lake all day during the Fourth of July. Unsurprisingly, the phone passed with flying colors. Everyone else left their iPhones and Galaxy phones on the boat, but I floated in the water, taking perfect pictures the entire day with my OnePlus 13.</p><p>What better timing to do this, too, because the 512GB OnePlus 13 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/oneplus-13-512gb-unlocked-midnight-ocean/CZYJWF7XQQ/sku/6609353"><strong>on sale for $150 off</strong></a> at Best Buy during the company's Black Friday in July event.

In addition to the longest software update commitments ever, companies like OnePlus and Honor have built smartphones equipped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-phone-makers-want-your-smartphone-to-survive-a-kitchen-nightmare">to survive a kitchen nightmare</a>.</p><p>I've already put the OnePlus 13 in a dishwasher several times and took it in a 155-degree Fahrenheit sauna for half an hour to test its durability, but taking it swimming all day is another feat entirely. Part of the problem is that, while many phones have featured IP68 water and dust resistance for years, that durability doesn't include "water jets" or moving water, which means you're not really supposed to actively swim with them.</p><p>IP69 changes all of that, and it means taking the OnePlus 13 in a river or lake was no big deal at all. The phone stayed in my zipped-up swimming pants pocket most of the time while I was in the lake and only came out when I wanted to take a picture. Not only does the phone withstand water for long periods of time, but Aqua Touch 2.0 ensures you can actually <em>touch</em> the screen even with wet fingers. Good luck doing that on an iPhone!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XoKsbUFQj6WFo8jqjVbRrk" name="oneplus-13-july-4-photo-montage-2" alt="A collage of four photos taken from a OnePlus 13 while swimming in a lake on July 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XoKsbUFQj6WFo8jqjVbRrk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Taking the phone in the water was a thing of joy. I was able to capture all the most memorable moments of the outing, including the gorgeous scenery around me in Western North Carolina, as well as all the best jumps and activities of the day.</p><p>When my friends and family were jumping off the boat, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review">OnePlus 13 camera</a> perfectly captured every splash and dive in crisp detail thanks to its ultra-fast dual-exposure algorithm. When the sun hit the water just right and turned it into "Mountain Dew water" under the boat around sunset, the OnePlus 13 perfectly captured that moment, too.</p><p>As the lighting dimmed and we headed in for dinner and s'mores, the OnePlus 13 captured the mood perfectly. I love using the portrait mode on the camera for people <em>and</em> food photos, and it even captured the dock lighting for an Instagram-worthy moment.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qRYkHwyzGG2QRE8eLz5hVY" name="oneplus-13-july-4-photo-montage-1" alt="A montage of photos captured by the OnePlus 13 on July 4, capturing fireworks, food, and mood lighting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qRYkHwyzGG2QRE8eLz5hVY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As the long day finally started to get dark, we rode the boat over to the main harbor where a fireworks show was scheduled. The OnePlus 13 ships with many different camera modes, and while I was taking photos of the fireworks across the water, the camera app suggested I switch to fireworks mode to more accurately capture the scene.</p><p>Boy, that was a great decision. It's nice to have a camera that's smart enough to suggest when different modes would be best to use, and the fireworks mode does a much better job of capturing the stark contrast between the bright fireworks and the otherwise dark lake scene.</p><p>As you've probably experienced before, the left image below isn't at all what it looked like to my eyes in real life. Rather, it was much more like the right image, and while the timing of my shot doesn't do the display justice, it still gives me a good memory to look back at down the road.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.85%;"><img id="cYmN5bGaWKF5vYKaGaLVBo" name="oneplus-13-july-4-fireworks-mode" alt="Comparing the default photo mode and the fireworks mode on the OnePlus 13's camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cYmN5bGaWKF5vYKaGaLVBo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6144" height="4353" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We don't normally do a ton for holidays like the Fourth of July, and I couldn't be happier that I had a phone like the OnePlus 13 to take with me on the year we finally get the chance to do something as epic as boating on the lake for the whole day.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is my favorite Android phone of all time for many reasons, but its versatility and durability are among the best reasons.
