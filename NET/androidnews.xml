                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It seems like just yesterday, we had a new streaming device to talk about almost every month. Nowadays, things have mostly calmed down, with Amazon, Apple, Google, and Roku leading the charge. Last year, Google shifted its focus, as it introduced the Google TV Streamer 4K, while also retiring the beloved Chromecast line.</p><p>Now, the Google TV Streamer sits atop the mountain in Google's ecosystem, operating as both a smart home hub and an excellent 4K streaming device. It wasn't really something that I expected to be part of the Prime Day festivities, but as it turns out, it's actually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Streamer-Streaming-Entertainment-Porcelain/dp/B0D8WJYSF9/"><strong>$15 off over at Amazon</strong></a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9645927358031349343-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><em><strong>Prime Day 2025 ends tonight!

Google thankfully rectified that with the TV Streamer, as it includes 32GB of storage. And if that isn't enough, you can connect a USB-C hub and a thumb drive to expand it even further.</p><p>There are also a few AI features on board, but they aren't really intrusive and are more novelty than anything else. However, the biggest reason why I love the TV Streamer is that it can basically turn my TV into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-display">massive smart display</a>.</p><p>Google integrated both Matter and a Thread Border Router into the TV Streamer, ensuring that it would be compatible with just about any smart home ecosystem. Of course, it works best when you use the Google Home app, but if you take the time to set up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/this-one-app-has-made-my-life-so-much-easier">Home Assistant</a>, you can connect and control all of your smart home devices right from the Google Home app.</p><p>I'm not sure what the future holds for the Google TV Streamer, but it's still performing well enough that it's not something I've even thought about.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-2">Prime Day 2025 Android deals ‚Äî quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4573639154595610853-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phones:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1212356707565852129-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9376992827335726461-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1233177422277781313-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4012941798439036658-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†</strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide.</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Even though Prime Day ends at midnight on July 11, some deals will persist on competing sites like Best Buy through the weekend, and one cheap (for Garmin) deal that's currently still available is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/garmin-venu-sq-2-gps-smartwatch-40mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-slate-2022/6517040.p?skuId=6517040"><strong>Garmin Venu Sq 2 at $149 ($100 off) at Best Buy</strong></a>.</p><p>We called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review">Garmin Venu Sq 2</a> the "Goldilocks smartwatch" in our original review because of how it struck a nice balance between smarts and fitness. Since then, Garmin watches have gotten smarter, but also more expensive; I'd love to recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-x1-bizarre-premium-watch-stuck-between-two-worlds">Venu X1</a>, but they're just too dang expensive for an impulse buy to try out the brand.</p><p>That's why I'm recommending the Venu Sq 2 as an affordable gateway into the world of Garmin, to see if you can change your lifestyle and become more fit with a little help, while also benefiting from perks like an 11-day battery life, all-systems GNSS tracking, and a 1.4-inch AMOLED display.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1cd4efa2-456e-408e-8eb3-30a2eb870a1d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Garmin Venu Sq 2 still holds up as an intriguing entry-level option to the brand.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Every time I go on vacation, I haul out my collection of Blink Mini Pan-Tilt cameras and set them up around my house. Each plugs into an outlet with a tiny power brick that fits anywhere, and thanks to the diminutive size, the PTZ camera also fits on any shelf or dresser.</p><p>Since it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-Pan-Tilt-Camera-White/dp/B09N6YCT3Y/"><strong>just $23</strong></a> for the rest of the day today, July 11, I can grab a few more to ensure I see every nook and cranny of my home while I'm away. That's $23 out the door, no subscription needed or strings to pull, and no garbage or hassles, and no worrying about someone spying on me since I only set them up when I'm away.</p><p>If you've got any other Blink cameras, these will tie right in with them in the Blink app, letting you monitor everything from one handy dashboard. Blink cameras don't require a subscription to work, and you can even pick up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Sync-Module-2/dp/B084RQ6MHJ">Blink Sync Module</a> to configure local storage on an SD card.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ffc90257-7011-43ec-9d72-4f83dc0c7612" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension48="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension25="$23.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-Pan-Tilt-Camera-White/dp/B09N6YCT3Y/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="uApUTnYB7nq2dT8wwMyFid" name="blink-mini-pan-tilt-official-product-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uApUTnYB7nq2dT8wwMyFid.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>There's no getting around it. For the price, it's nearly impossible to argue with what Blink offers. Great camera quality, a wider range of movement than Ring, a quick 360-degree pan button to scope out the whole room, and the ability to store footage locally or in the cloud.¬†</p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/blink-ptz-vs-ring-ptz-cameras-which-amazon-brand-should-see-your-home" data-dimension112="ffc90257-7011-43ec-9d72-4f83dc0c7612" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension48="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension25="$23.99"><strong>Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison </strong></a>üì∑</p><p><strong>‚úÖRecommended if: </strong>you're looking for an amazing indoor PTZ camera that has a full 360-degree range of movement, 135-degree tilt range, motion detection, and even a two-way speaker so you can hear what's going on in your house and speak to whoever is there, invited or not!</p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a camera with 4K resolution, AI-powered object detection, or something more advanced.

It's a horrible security risk if anyone ever gains access to your account, but these cameras are so small and so easy to set up that it's never a hassle to pull them out when I want to use them.</p><p>It's worth noting that this camera is only designed for indoor use. It's not weather-rated at all, so it's definitely going to break if it gets soaked in a rainstorm or baked in the summer heat. Blink sells other cameras that are made for outdoor use. I actually have several of them in my chicken coop, and they do a great job of monitoring the temperature there and in the outdoor rabbit hutch we have.</p><p>Overall, I love Blink and use it for almost all my smart home cameras. It's especially handy that I can keep the footage on local SD cards and not have to pay for cloud storage, although that option is great for people who would rather skip the hassle of dealing with swapping out SD cards or changing video sources.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The fact of the matter is, investing a tiny bit of cash into a stellar charging ecosystem can result in big quality-of-life improvements. If you don't have quality chargers and cables, you're probably not making the most of your flagship tech products.</p><p>Luckily, as Amazon Prime Day winds down, there are still deals that let you build out a fantastic charging portfolio on a budget. I've put together a list of four Anker products that'll help you do just that. Some are priced <strong>as low as under $6</strong>, while the most expensive charger in this roundup is <strong>only $17.99</strong>.</p><p>If you're someone that rolls their eyes at buying new chargers or hates overpaying for unnecessary junk, this is the practical list of Prime Day charging deals you need to jump on ‚Äî all from popular charging brand Anker.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-8764089166276989524-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Amazon Prime Day is ENDING today!

If the wall adapter plugging into your outlet doesn't support a fast charging speed, nothing else matters. The Anker Nano 3 can deliver 30W fast charging, and considering its small size, that's wildly impressive. Foldable wall prongs mean you can easily throw the Nano 3 in a bag or pocket without issue.</p><p>I've been using Anker Nano chargers for years, and have convinced a few friends and family members to switch to them. After they gave Anker Nano a shot, they didn't want to use any other wall charger. You can pick one up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">only $12 on Prime Day.</a></p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="43b5d6e6-2560-46e2-bd60-2d5bf12c0f07" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker Nano 3:¬† $19.99" data-dimension48="Anker Nano 3:¬† $19.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="7HiXjadHykh6wMgScDbGBE" name="Anker 511 Nano 3 USB C GaN Charger 30W.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7HiXjadHykh6wMgScDbGBE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="1066" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Anker Nano 3:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="43b5d6e6-2560-46e2-bd60-2d5bf12c0f07" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker Nano 3:¬† $19.99" data-dimension48="Anker Nano 3:¬† $19.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$19.99</del> <strong>$12.29 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Anker Nano 3 should be the default USB-C wall adapter.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>What if I told you that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/NUU-T-Mobile-Teenagers-Octa-Core-Unlocked/dp/B0DLG4WKKG"><strong>just $109</strong></a> could get you an Android 14-powered smartphone with an octa-core processor, 90Hz display, and some pretty snazzy colors on Prime Day? This isn't some back alley deal, it's just the best smartphone deal you'll find today since it's so darn cheap. And yeah, I have four of them. Don't judge me.</p><p>The Nuu N20 is a surprisingly capable phone that'll do all the basics and then some. It's a great choice for your kid's first phone, a vacation phone (so you don't have to worry about something more expensive getting stolen), or even just as a backup device to keep in a drawer.</p><p>This one ramped up in price in May because of the lovely tariff situation in the U.S. but it's back down to pre-tariff pricing until the end of the day today, Friday, July 11. That's the last day of Prime Day, if you hadn't heard!</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="cb6b0bc0-78b0-459c-9174-4a1c21d75fa9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Coral" data-dimension48="Coral" data-dimension25="$109" href="https://www.amazon.com/NUU-T-Mobile-Teenagers-Octa-Core-Unlocked/dp/B0DLG4WKKG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1432px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:104.75%;"><img id="ua5jKrVxHZ77XWbeQF5ugJ" name="nuun-20-product-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ua5jKrVxHZ77XWbeQF5ugJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1432" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Also check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLG5C7SD/" data-dimension112="cb6b0bc0-78b0-459c-9174-4a1c21d75fa9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Coral" data-dimension48="Coral" data-dimension25="$109"><strong>Coral</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLGHZ3YN/"><strong>Purple</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLGKWNMR/"><strong>Green</strong></a> colorways for the same price!</p><p>The Nuu N20 is a no-frills Android 14-powered phone that can download all your favorite apps from the Google Play Store and works perfectly with U.S. 4G networks like T-Mobile. Grab one for your kids, your next vacation, or just as a backup phone in case yours breaks.</p><p><strong>‚úÖRecommended if: </strong>you need a simple Android phone that can do all the basics ‚Äî phone calls, messaging, downloading apps, taking pictures and video ‚Äî but don't need anything high-powered or expensive. This one doesn't look or feel cheap, despite what you might assume!</p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if: </strong>you have no interest in a cheap backup phone.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/NUU-T-Mobile-Teenagers-Octa-Core-Unlocked/dp/B0DLG4WKKG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="cb6b0bc0-78b0-459c-9174-4a1c21d75fa9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Coral" data-dimension48="Coral" data-dimension25="$109">View Deal</a></p></div><p>As you might imagine, the Nuu N20 isn't going to win any awards for best display, camera, or processing speed. But what it will win is the best Prime Day value award, because it gives you a full-fledged Android 14-powered experience without all the fluff that comes with other devices.</p><p>Nuu is based in Miami, Florida, and does an excellent job crafting a stock-like Android experience without the bloat or preinstalled nonsense that some other budget brands fill their phones with.</p><p>This one's got 6GB of RAM, which is 50% more than any Motorola phone at this price range, and the 90Hz display feels smoother than even the $1,000 iPhones. No, I'm dead serious there. The non-Pro iPhones use a paltry 60Hz screen, which feels just plain awful in 2025. Meanwhile, this $109 phone eclipses half of Apple's recent lineup in this one area. It's pretty wild.</p><p>Nuu also advertises that the N20 works perfectly with any parental control app, so you can keep your kids safe online. I personally use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bark.us/">Bark parental controls</a> for my son and love how it can catch even bad images that might appear on your child's phone, thanks to the "wonders" of the internet. Whatever you do with it, though, make sure you buy it before midnight tonight, otherwise this deal is gone.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is a phenomenal system with lots of upgrades over the original model, but some people are unhappy with the LCD screen on the system. While Nintendo doesn't sell an OLED-equipped model yet, you can get an OLED on the go when using a pair of smart glasses, but you'll need this clever battery pack to get the job done.</p><p>Thankfully, the Viture Pro Mobile Dock is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Compatible-PlayStation-Supports-Handheld/dp/B0D3LT6BJW"><strong>on sale for $98.10</strong></a> on the last day of Prime Day, which ends Friday, July 11. This 10,000mAh battery pack has a set of special USB-C ports that trick the Switch 2 into thinking it's docked to a TV, unlocking the full power of the system and making it possible to play it on a pair of OLED-equipped smart glasses. Not only that, but this supports <em>two</em> smart glasses at a time, so you and someone else can play at the same time with a giant virtual OLED.</p><p>See, with most handheld systems, you can just plug smart glasses into the USB-C port and your system thinks it's docked, but not the Switch 2. Nintendo locked down the USB-C port on this system just as with the original Switch, but Viture cleverly designed the Mobile Dock to work with Nintendo's security, making this the <em>only </em>way to play on a Switch 2 with smart glasses.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vitures-new-luma-glasses-are-incredible-and-this-viture-prime-day-sale-is-impossible-to-resist"><strong>Viture's new Luma glasses are incredible, and this Viture Prime Day sale is impossible to resist</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="03daf6d7-3403-4322-88d2-8268e68c337a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central review" data-dimension48="Android Central review" data-dimension25="$98.10" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HWLY3T" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1425px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tUS3fEEJW9kcgoeZyj8NwR" name="viture-pro-mobile-dock-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tUS3fEEJW9kcgoeZyj8NwR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1425" height="1425" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Be sure to clip the </em><em><strong>10% off coupon</strong></em><em> on Amazon's page before checking out to get the full discount.</em></p><p>Plug the Viture Pro Mobile Dock¬†into your Switch 2 and enjoy docked performance and quality on the go.

Trying out these glasses, and their embedded speakers, showed me how freeing it is to listen to music on-the-go without clogging up your ears. Enter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds" target="_blank">the best open-earbuds</a>, designed to provide a personal listening experience without the hassle.</p><p>Why might you want a pair of open earbuds? This style of audio gear might make sense if you're someone that has a hard time finding ear tips and buds that fit perfectly. Since the Bose Ultra Open earbuds sit outside your ear canal, this isn't a problem at all. They gently rest outside your ear canal while subtly clipping onto your earlobe for comfort and security.</p><p>The open design means you can also let ambient noise in, which can be desirable in a few kinds of situations. Maybe you're a runner or cyclist who needs to hear the world around you for a safe workout. Or, perhaps you work at a jobsite or office where it's necessary to hear what's going on nearby.</p><p>There are a few tradeoffs ‚Äî without passive isolation, bass reproduction won't be at its best and you might need to crank the volume up in noisy environments. But for the right person, these are small sacrifices that become worthwhile to get the perfect fit.

Rumors suggest we might see one pretty soon.</p><p>A render of a fancy-looking Motorola Razr was posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/exclusive-motorola-razr-swarovski-edition-is-launching-soon-first-look/">YTECHB</a> today (July 11), suggesting an incoming collaboration edition (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_is_working_on_a_blingedup_razr-news-68590.php">GSMArena</a>). The publication claims Motorola is preparing to bring a fancy new "crystal-studded" Razr 2025 foldable edition. From the rendering, the device looks mostly the same, save for the small crystals (kind of like diamonds) popped into its form factor.</p><p>On the cover display, there are supposedly three crystals implanted near the hinge, just above the screen. The back of the device is where the design is reportedly going to shine the most. It seems Motorola will implant crystal studs into a (seemingly) soft fabric material, which looks almost like a fancified purse.</p><p>Prominent X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1943538675964342466">Evan Blass</a> got in on things, stating this phone is looking at a debut on August 5; however, we might know who it's with. The tipster's post and the publication both claim Motorola is looking at Swarovski, a jewelry company, to bedazzle its foldable.</p><p>Moreover, it seems this collaboration edition will only concern the base Razr 2025 foldable. The rendering doubles down on this, furthered by the thicker border between the cover display and the hinge. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra</a> offers a slightly larger display (4-inch), so the border is much thinner on it.</p><h2 id="motorola-and-its-collabs-special-editions-2">Motorola and its collabs/special editions</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:591px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.49%;"><img id="7dpZ2q5aERYqm45FBGiMs8" name="motorola-razr-2025-swarovski-render-leak" alt="A leaked render of the Motorola Razr 2025 with a light blue color scheme for its rumored Swarovski jewelry collaboration." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7dpZ2q5aERYqm45FBGiMs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="591" height="588" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YTECHB)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The name Swarovski might sound familiar, and that's because Motorola collaborated with them once before (or you like their jewelry). Earlier this year, when the Razr 2025 series debuted, Motorola launched its first-ever open-earbuds, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-buds-loop-watch-fit-spotlight-details-launch">the Buds Loop</a>. These buds are offered with 12mm drivers for rich sound, and they come in the following colors: Pantone-curated Trekking Green and a dazzling Pantone-curated French Oak.</p><p>However, there was a third option: a crystal-encrusted version, thanks to Swarovski. These buds are lighter in color, and the crystals are present along the band that connects the two halves of the device for each ear. It seems Motorola was pleased with the first round, so it's looking into the collaboration again for its foldable phone.</p><p>Motorola has always been one for unique collaborations and special editions. Back in February, the company launched a special edition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-paris-pink-limited-edition-launch">Razr Plus 2024 with Paris Hilton</a>. The device was offered in a new Paris Pink with a vegan leather finish, as well as two wrist straps in Pink Sparkle and Pink Vegan Leather. Consumers could also grab a vegan leather case that continues the Paris Pink trend with her signature and iconic phrase, "That's Hot."</p><p>On a more subtle note, the Razr Plus 2024 also received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-2024-razr-plus-pantone-rich-mocha-shade">a Mocha Mousse color</a> from Pantone late last year.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Of course, immediately facing a lot of people is the main Android OS: Android 16. While Google has fast-tracked Android 16, moving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-16-tricks-showcase-report">into the "Trunk Stable" process</a> for quicker development cycles, Samat says the software's goal remains letting users "fit the ethos of what‚Äôs on your home screen with the rest of your phone."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> is a noteworthy upgrade; however, Samat states the goal was to create an OS that felt ‚Äúmodern and delightful‚Äù without disrupting your muscle memory.</p><p>While Samat feels confident in his work at Google with Android, stating, ‚ÄúI think you see the future first on Android," there's more to do. Specifically, Samat is concerned about bridging the gap between iOS and Android for users who <em>want </em>to switch. Samat says, "...this should be simple. It's 2025." Currently, there's an issue when switching platforms, and risks.</p><p>Samat is interested in utilizing in using more modern "industry standards to move data between the two, and that is a lot of what we‚Äôre advocating for and pushing for."</p><p>Google is leaning into its large design changes in Android 16 (and likely the future) when it comes to statements like seeing the "future first" on the software. Android 16 adds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a>, which largely changes animations, colors, and more.</p><h2 id="gemini-takes-center-stage-2">Gemini takes center stage</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum" name="Gemini-Era-Google.jpg" alt="The Gemini Era graphic from Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthering Android's future are plans to merge "ChromeOS and Android into a single platform." Samat teased that there's a strong curiosity behind understanding how users (such as those on iOS) are using their phones with their laptops.</p><p>TechRadar and Samat's discussions boiled down into another key Android area: Gemini. Per Samat, "...Gemini integrated in a phone really provides a much more helpful experience." The AI is a part of Google's plans for Android, and its assistance will likely only continue to progress and evolve. In their interview, Samat showed off Gemini's ability to summarize a YouTube video, equipped with timestamps for fact-checking.</p><p>The publication called it a "powerful demonstration," partly due to Apple's lack of such capabilities with its Intelligence/Siri software.</p><p>Samat praises Google's AI once more, highlighting its ease of use for consumers. He says, "Gemini is the best assistant out there. Hold down the side key on any flagship Android phone, it‚Äôs gonna bring up Gemini, right to the context of where you‚Äôre at. Those two capabilities are built by Google."</p><p>TechRadar and Sameer Samat continued their interview, discussing the idea of "too much AI" and what's empowering Android XR.

While it brought some substantial design changes, Google also packed in a host of new features for users. Among them, you'll find Live Updates, which are real-time updates concerning navigation and even food orders. Android 16 also streamlined notifications, making it easier for alerts belonging to the same app to be displayed without overwhelming (or cluttering) your device.</p><p>Additionally, the OS added Advanced Protection software, a feature that better protects a user's phones from unsafe websites and "most sophisticated attacks."</p><p>Google has also been working with other OEMs like Samsung and OnePlus to help flesh out their features for Android 16 for a more cohesive OS. The future of Android continues as the company recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-canary-release-channel-devs-rigorous-testing-pixels">Android Canary Release Channel</a> for developers.

You can find headphones that offer a better sound, but you're going to pay a lot of money for a relatively small gain in quality. In fact, these rank as one of my favorites, along with "budget" picks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E/ref=sr_1_9?th=1" target="_blank">from Sony</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/HIFIMAN-XS-Headphones-Audiophiles-Studio-Black/dp/B09PH1N67T/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank">Hifiman</a>. They sound a lot better than their price tag would indicate.</p><p>The perfect pair of headphones doesn't exist, but if it did, they would inflect nothing of their own into your music; reproducing it exactly as it comes from the source. With a THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) of less than 0.1% these come really close. Close enough that you probably wouldn't notice it at all.</p><p>Open-back headphones offer a unique experience, but come with drawbacks. If you are the type who carries around a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">portable headphone amp</a> for your phone, don't use these while out and about unless you want everyone to "enjoy" whatever you're listening to. Outside of that, open-back cans offer a wonderful sound stage and almost sound like you're listening at a concert instead of a chair.</p><p>Big over-ear headphones with wires aren't for everyone, and I get it. You should use whatever you love when you want to enjoy your music. If you really like what you hear from a good set of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">wireless earbuds</a>, save your $100 and put it towards the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds Pro</a> model.</p><p>If you want to try something different, know you want something better, or are just curious, you'll be hard pressed to find a cheaper way to get started down the wonderfully frustrating and expensive path of the audiophile.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-42">Prime Day 2025 Android deals ‚Äî quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When you think of a protective phone case, you probably think of something that covers the entirety of the phone to ensure maximum protection. The Arc Pulse case series says "you don't need all that nonsense," but usually doesn't give you a price break for its lack of materials. Thankfully, Prime Day changes that with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Arc-Pulse-Compatible-Minimalist-Protective/dp/B0FBMDPGW7/"><strong>rare 20% discount</strong></a> on what are otherwise pretty expensive phone cases.</p><p>Arc Pulse works by covering the area of your phone that most commonly come in contact with the ground when it's dropped. That's the top and bottom edges, as well as all four corners. It's even got protective lips around the front edge of the display, but the rest of the phone is totally exposed for the whole world to see.</p><p>Arc Pulse cases are often limited-run items. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-arc-pulse-case-impressions">Pixel 9 Arc Pulse case</a> can no longer be found on Amazon, even though the manufacturer sells them in limited quantities on its website. That makes a discount on the cases a special event, but it's only good <strong>until the end of the day</strong> Friday, July 11.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="33716586-805b-4f61-ae48-a1fbbb6df27e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central review" data-dimension48="Android Central review" data-dimension25="$71.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Arc-Pulse-Compatible-Minimalist-Protective/dp/B0FBMDPGW7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Tzpz7tBJRSCDcDwSuVgk3V" name="arc-pulse-case-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tzpz7tBJRSCDcDwSuVgk3V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>"I don't often drop test phones in cases because so many cases are very similar, but Arc Pulse is a different beast entirely. For the test, I dropped the phone on three different flooring types: a wood floor, an area rug placed on concrete, and bare concrete. I dropped it at pocket height, roughly 3ft, and at head height, roughly 6ft, to simulate the two most common ways someone might drop their phone. To my surprise, the¬†Google Pixel 9 Pro XL¬†was spotless after all these drops. No scratches, cracks, or any other damage was found, and the case's unique design is surprisingly effective." ‚Äî Nick Sutrich for Android Central</p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-arc-pulse-case-impressions" data-dimension112="33716586-805b-4f61-ae48-a1fbbb6df27e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central review" data-dimension48="Android Central review" data-dimension25="$71.99"><strong>Android Central review</strong> ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</a></p><p><strong>‚úÖRecommended if: </strong>you love the way your phone looks and hate covering it up, but are afraid to drop something that costs $1,300 outright.

I prefer to use my phones without a case, but not everyone is as crazy as me. This, at least, gives you protection on the most important parts without ruining the look and feel of a caseless phone.</p><p>The case is made entirely of metal, so you know it's super sturdy, and has a rubberized interior shock layer that keeps the metal from scratching or impacting your precious glass phone in the event of a drop.</p><p>When I got the first Arc Pulse case for the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL earlier this year, I made a quick video showing the drop test performance on carpet, wood, and concrete from two different heights. Check out that video below to see how it would protect your Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lMcYXG5BWCM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Even with this video evidence, I totally understand being nervous about buying an ultra-minimalist case like this. <em>In that case</em>, I recommend grabbing the Pitaka Aramid Fiber case for Galaxy S25 Ultra, also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/pitaka-Compatible-MagSafe-Samsung-Ultra-Slim/dp/B0DQ1V2J7W"><strong>on sale for 20% off</strong></a> for the rest of the day today.</p><p>An Aramid Fiber case is designed to offer additional grip for these super slippery glass-and-metal sandwich phones, as well as scratch protection in the event of a drop. Not that they are generally <em>not</em> great for drops on concrete or similar situations, while the all-metal and rubber-lined Arc Pulse case above will almost certainly do a better job, ironically.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Over the years, I've slowly stopped wearing smart watches during the day and typically only wear them for working out, hiking, or other outdoor activities. Turns out, the Instinct 2X Solar was <em>made</em> for this kind of use and beyond, as its <strong>40-day battery life</strong> was a staggering improvement over my previous favorite Wear OS watches.</p><p>The Instinct 2X Solar has a dope solar panel on top, which can not only measure the UV intensity (letting you know when to put more sun coverage on), but it also charges the super bright flashlight built into the side. If that's not enough, its ability to understand which muscles you're working out while on the go feels like pure magic, and it will help you better log and train for specific fitness improvement.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ff418896-5e1d-4275-a82a-0a7040186f29" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: $449.99" data-dimension48="Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: $449.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Capability-Multi-Band/dp/B0BW34M77J/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="v7uqQbSmikoXGmg4i53mS" name="Garmin Instinct 2x Solar" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v7uqQbSmikoXGmg4i53mS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Capability-Multi-Band/dp/B0BW34M77J/" data-dimension112="ff418896-5e1d-4275-a82a-0a7040186f29" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: $449.99" data-dimension48="Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: $449.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$449.99</del><strong> $299.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><strong>Price check üíµ: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-smartwatch-50-mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-gray-2023/6541150.p?skuId=6541150"><strong>$299 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>"I loved the¬†Garmin Instinct 2 Solar¬†when I reviewed it last year, but what a difference a year makes!

I sprained my ankle last week so I've been doing more upper-body stuff this week to give me ankle a rest (plus a lot less cardio since, you know, it hurts to use the ankle). All I did was set my Garmin Instinct 2X Solar to a HIIT workout and click the "go" button. It magically figured out what I was working out, all without me needing to tell it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:110.01%;"><img id="HmBDb8wjcLctzVr2uPtKoE" name="garmin-instinct-2x-solar-hiit-workout" alt="A HIIT workout with muscle usage as measured by a Garmin Instinct 2X Solar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmBDb8wjcLctzVr2uPtKoE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="2253" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Amazfit Balance 2 I've been using can do something similar, but it usually only assigns muscle usage based on specific workout types. For instance, I used it to log "strength training" and it was able to figure out that I was doing deadlifts, so it logged my legs as being heavily used. But selecting a HIIT workout on the Amazfit Balance 2 will only give me heart rate data, not muscle usage.</p><p>While this muscle data might seem superfluous at first, it's actually incredibly helpful for specific training. That way, you know exactly which muscles were used by each type of workout, even if you go to a CrossFit or WOD type of gym with a lot of variety. If I were in the market for another smartwatch right now, this is the deal I'd be buying today. There's absolutely no question.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Thinborne cases are sleek, svelte, and offer excellent protection thanks to the use of Aramid Fiber. Plus, since Samsung didn't include the magnetic element of Qi2.1, Thinborne picks up the slack by integrating MagSafe compatibility. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FDV764HR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="05f37a28-2b47-461e-a7b9-41a03437ee1c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Thinborne Aramid Fiber Galaxy Z Fold 7 Case:¬† $89.98" data-dimension48="Thinborne Aramid Fiber Galaxy Z Fold 7 Case:¬† $89.98" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>‚úÖRecommended if: </strong>you're not really a fan of cases, or just prefer them to be ultra-thin while still offering excellent protection. Or you want a thin case that is actually compatible with MagSafe.</p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if: </strong>you need a phone case that protects your Fold 7 or Flip 7 from every angle, regardless of how hefty it is.</p><p>Something else to take into consideration when trying to find a case for the Fold 7 or Flip 7 is that neither offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-qi2-wireless-charging-support">full Qi2.1 support</a>. Instead, both of these phones meet the bare minimum requirements for Qi2.1 certification, but lack the internal hardware magnets. This is partially why Samsung is releasing a few of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-cases">its own</a> cases with the necessary magnetic ring built in.</p><p>I can only assume that Samsung didn't add magnets because that would potentially mean not being able to make these phones as thin as they are. And while that's definitely disappointing, having something like a Thinborne case more than makes up for it.</p><p>Nevertheless, I'm grateful that I don't have to deal with trying to get a dbrand skin aligned properly before trying to do the same with an adhesive MagSafe adapter. I can't tell you how many times I've thought that everything was lined up, only to find that the phone wouldn't charge when mounted on a MagSafe charger. Or even more annoying is trying to take off my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PopSockets-Compatible-Wireless-Charging-Wars-Long/dp/B0CZS4S32H/">MagSafe PopSocket</a>, only to pull the adapter off with it.</p><p>Thinborne solves all of those problems, while actually offering quite a bit more protection than a phone skin will. And like I mentioned above, both the Fold 7 and Flip 7 versions are on sale for 30% when using either code <strong>5ZOUHBLK</strong> or <strong>5ECY7ANJ </strong>at checkout.<strong> </strong></p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-52">Prime Day 2025 Android deals ‚Äî quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4671599217540639638-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phones:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1426801779885312155-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9718275238151007431-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1026980263717059872-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-6189443266861686266-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Despite the lightweight frame, the S25 Edge is still packed with a ton of flagship-level specs, such as the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 12GB of RAM, and a massive 200MP camera. The device also boasts a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a durable Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 construction, plus you get seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed.¬†</p><p>With its 3,900mAh battery, it&apos;s true that the S25 Edge may not last as long as other modern flagships, but it&apos;s a small price to pay if, like me, you want the sleekest Android phone on the market today. My only major concern with the Edge was its price, but thanks to this last-minute Prime Day deal, that&apos;s much less of a problem.¬†</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-x2014-quick-links-7">Prime Day 2025 Android deals ‚Äî quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

According to the post, the chip has received the codename "Aspen," it's known as "SW6100" internally for Qualcomm, and it's "testing phase." At the moment, the publication claims the chip is preparing a noticeable CPU upgrade, courtesy of a 1+4 core setup.</p><p>This core setup reportedly features one Arm Cortex-A78 alongside four Arm Cortex-A55 cores. Despite these cores being roughly a year old, speculation suggests this CPU upgrade could benefit the chip's "efficiency and performance."</p><p>Other alleged specs include the use of a TSMC node and a RAM controller upgrade. The chip will reportedly support LPDDR5X for a slight "battery life boost." There have also been whispers about a new coprocessor; however, the publication states concrete information about that hardware is still in the dark.</p><p>Rumors add that this Qualcomm chip for future Wear OS devices could debut sometime in 2026.</p><h2 id="take-a-step-back-into-2024-2">Take a step back into 2024</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5193px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MRmBQzMmweVwxvaQX2ZfQb" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-w5+-embedded-in-watch.jpg" alt="Qualcomm Snapdragon W5+ on device up-close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MRmBQzMmweVwxvaQX2ZfQb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5193" height="2921" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's where things get interesting. Android Central's Michael Hicks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">sat down with Qualcomm's VP & GM of Wearables</a>, Dino Bekis, about the future of the company's Wear OS chips after previous disappointments. While Bekis stated the "next" chip would be more "feature-focused" for Wear OS devices, with AI and PC-like additions, it might need a little more time in the oven. Bekis mentions that Qualcomm was still working with Google to figure out its RISC-V cores.</p><p>Moreover, the company has thought about using its Oryon cores in this wearable chip (the same ones that power its flagship phone SoC), but there's no telling if this recently rumored chip is <em>that </em>chip.</p><p>These were all things talked about in 2024, and it seems we're still floating around the same bits of information. As Android Authority also speculates, this chip could be called the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 or, perhaps, something else, when it debuts.</p><p>The last chips to come from Qualcomm for wearables were the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 and W5 Plus Gen 1</a>. While they generally fixed some of the issues plaguing the Wear OS market, the chips provided a ~50% battery life boost based on a 4nm process. Considering the recent rumors, perhaps we'll see this improve to a 3nm process for the next iteration.</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 has become my favorite tablet of the year, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/tablets/android-tablets/lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3/len103g0002"><strong>is now $120 off</strong></a> in a Lenovo Doorbuster deal.</p><p>When it was announced, I was already excited, seeing as it packs the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 behind a gorgeous 8.8-inch screen. It was also expected to be pretty affordable with a $499 launch price. However, the U.S. tariff situation resulted in the price being increased to $549 just days after it was released.</p><p>Since then, we've seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo/3-reasons-why-this-is-the-android-tablet-you-should-buy">Legion Tab Gen 3</a> drop as low as $449, but now, you can get it for even less.

Unlike many other premium tablets out there, Lenovo opted against using an OLED panel. This is great news for those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">who suffer from PWM</a>, such as my colleague Nick Sutrich.</p><p>While I could continue gushing about how great this tablet is, there are a couple of sticking points. The first of which is that you're stuck with one RAM and storage configuration (12GB/256GB), and there's no microSD card slot. Lenovo remedied this with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo/even-lenovo-knows-that-you-want-to-use-your-tablet-as-a-gaming-handheld">latest Y700 tablet</a>, but that has yet to see a release here in the States.</p><p>Another surprising omission is that the Legion Tab Gen 3 lacks a fingerprint scanner. When the tablet was announced, I just assumed it would be embedded in the power button. That's not the case, so you're left relying on the traditional unlock methods, and while there's Face Unlock, it's the rather basic version that adorned older and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/no-joke-this-is-the-cheap-android-phone-that-i-would-buy-right-now">cheaper phones</a>.</p><p>Despite those pitfalls, the Legion Tab Gen 3 is still my favorite tablet of the year, to this point. It's so good that I ended up picking up a second one that will be used for my various tinkering projects without needing to worry about something happening to the one I already have.

If you've found yourself in this situation more than once, I recommend picking up a pair of CMF Buds 2a from Amazon, as these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2M1KYR7"><strong>normally run $50 but are down to just $28</strong></a> for the final day of the 4-day Prime Day event. That sale <strong>ends today</strong>, Friday, July 11.</p><p>If you're not a fan of the overtly <em>radical</em> orange color I'm wearing in the picture above, don't worry. CMF sells these in black or white colorways, and they're the same price as the orange ones. These work just as well with Android phones as they do with iPhones, so don't worry about what phone you (or your friends) prefer.</p><p>CMF Buds 2a are from the Nothing brand, a UK company that sells design-forward products, normally at incredibly reasonable prices. These are already our favorite budget earbuds under $50, and this ridiculous Prime Day deal makes them a perfect impulse buy choice.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ca5d2fff-abe1-474f-9fe7-6017bfb8f60e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $49.99" data-dimension48="Was: $49.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2M1KYR7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MLv22rJErGsQukJoobxGq9" name="CMF-Buds-2a" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLv22rJErGsQukJoobxGq9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>CMF Buds 2a üéß</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2M1KYR7/" data-dimension112="ca5d2fff-abe1-474f-9fe7-6017bfb8f60e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $49.99" data-dimension48="Was: $49.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$49.99</del></a></p><p><strong>Now: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2M1KYR7/"><strong>$28 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><strong>Price check üíµ: </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/CMF-Buds-2a-Wireless-Earbuds-Bluetooth-5-4-IP54-42-dB-ANC-12-4mm-Dynamic-Driver-for-Big-Bass-Up-to-35-5-Hours-of-Battery-Life-Orange/16550373168"><strong>$28 at Walmart</strong></a></p><p>"Honestly, the Buds 2 by itself is a fabulous choice considering it doesn't miss out on much. The buds have a glossy finish around the shell and a matte stalk, and the gesture recognition surface is decent enough.

That case also has a wonderful fidget spinner wheel on the side that doubles as a lanyard holder, so you can keep it laced up in your pocket or bag so the case never falls out.</p><p>The buds themselves are super lightweight and comfortable, with different eartip sizes in the box and a design that looks as good as it feels.</p><p>If you're in the market for spending just a tad more, I recommend trying out CMF Buds Pro 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Buds-Pro-Cancelling-Technology/dp/B0D81S532L"><strong>at just $47 today</strong></a>. They upgrade the audio quality and turn that little fidget wheel into a volume rocker, complete with a customizable button and tons of enhanced ANC support. They're my personal favorite, and that little wheel and the sound quality bump is enough for me to recommend them over anything else because of the crazy good price.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

That's where a new face pad comes in, and Kiwi Design makes the best ones on the market. Meta Quest 3 gamers can get the Kiwi Design Quest 3 face pad <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098JTDPQChttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D48YLZJD"><strong>for under $20</strong></a> <em>for the first time ever</em>. Just make sure to clip that $5 coupon on Amazon's site to get the full discount.</p><p>If you've used a Quest but have never changed out the face pad, you don't know what you're missing. Kiwi makes its pads with a super supple, allergen-free PU leather that'll wick the sweat off your skin during these stupidly hot summer days. They're also <em>ultra-easy to clean</em>, so you can share your headset with someone else without needing to put it in a hazmat bag afterwards. Just remove the pad with the velcro backing, clean it with a cloth and a gentle cleaning agent, and it's good as new!</p><p>As a bonus, the plastic piece that snaps into the Meta Quest 3 itself has four ventilation holes on it that not only pull out all the face humidity to keep the lenses from fogging up all the time, but it also helps keep your face cool and somehow magically blocks out light.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-and-quest-3s-controller-upgrades-prime-day-2025"><strong>Meta Quest controller upgrades for under $20 on Prime Day</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-2025-early-deals-and-faq" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><strong></strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-anti-prime-day-deals-2025"><strong>Anti-Prime deals from Best Buy</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4896e2e6-6d36-49da-8205-df7056c8ee41" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get sweet relief for your sweating face with this Kiwi Design facial interface replacement for the Meta Quest 3.

Therefore, one that comes with a stylus for handwriting input is twice as awesome as a regular one. Usually, the¬†Kindle Scribe¬†makes for a poor purchase. But with this deal, it is a lot cheaper, helping it rise to the top as one of the best e-readers and E Ink tablets that money can buy.

While the e-reader slash E Ink tablet is a good product for reading and writing, the $420 price tag is too high. I'd rather recommend more powerful and higher-spec-bearing color e-paper tablets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Color-ePaper-Notebook/dp/B0DT3Q52PN/"><strong>Onyx Boox Note Air 4C for $500</strong></a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Go-Color-Gen-II/dp/B0F58ZHCX2/"><strong>Boox Go Color 7 which is just $280</strong></a>.</p><p>Thanks to this Prime Day deal, though, the Kindle Scribe is finally worth buying. As expected from any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">great E Ink tablet</a>, it has a gorgeous e-paper display that looks just like real books and consumes very little power. The display is what makes a Kindle so stunning, because Amazon's e-paper screens are extremely crisp and lovely to look at.

I have a few thermal cameras on hand, and in the last two months, I relied on the handheld Thor 002 imaging camera by Thermal Master to monitor device thermals and identify hot spots.</p><p>The Thor 002 is an all-in-one device, and while the handheld is big ang bulky, it is packed with innovative tech. It has a 3.5-inch 60Hz panel, 5000mAh battery, and a new IR module that gives it a 521 x 384 resolution ‚Äî considerably higher than other devices in this category. The thermal camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Thermal-512%C3%97384-Resolution-Imaging/dp/B0F5461RX3">costs $284 on Amazon with code TMTHOR002</a>, but that's only until this weekend; after that, it will go up to $399. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-in-1089859931413247931-20">plenty of deals still live</a> if you're looking to buy tech this Prime Day.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4d97ce9a-674f-486b-8ae4-0b1b6108cf8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension48="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension25="$284" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Thermal-512%C3%97384-Resolution-Imaging/dp/B0F5461RX3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="CziPE5QFjaezE9NpkNTAnJ" name="Thermal Master Thor 002 Handheld Thermal Camera" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CziPE5QFjaezE9NpkNTAnJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Thor 002 is a handheld thermal imaging camera that has the highest-resolution sensor in this category, making it the ideal choice if you need to monitor thermals of a tech gadget or locate any hot spots in your home. </p><p>‚úÖRecommended if: You want a handheld thermal camera with the best sensor. The Thor 002 has a great IR sensor, and it overlays the thermal image over a real-time preview. There are plenty of filters available, and you'll only need to charge the battery once a week. </p><p>‚ùåSkip this deal if: You need a smaller device. Thermal Master also makes a dongle-sized model called the P2 Pro that plugs into your phone, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-P2-Pro-Resolution-Lightning/dp/B0DYDZXCMC" data-dimension112="4d97ce9a-674f-486b-8ae4-0b1b6108cf8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension48="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension25="$284">that model is $239 right now</a>. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Thermal-512%C3%97384-Resolution-Imaging/dp/B0F5461RX3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="4d97ce9a-674f-486b-8ae4-0b1b6108cf8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension48="that model is $239 right now" data-dimension25="$284">View Deal</a></p></div><p>It's easy to hold and use the Thor 002, and it charges via a USB-C cable. What I like is that you can easily slot in a MicroSD card to store photos. The 3.5-inch panel is ideally suited to monitor thermals, and the 60Hz panel is fluid. The panel has a standard 640√ó480 resolution, and it uses a new IR sensor to boost the resolution of the image to 521 x 384.</p><p>It's incredibly accurate at monitoring minute changes in heat, and it has the ability to go up to 1,022 degrees F. You get a max/min range, color profiles, and the ability to transfer data to your phone. It even gets 4x digital zoom, and the resolution is usable at that distance. The 5,000mAh battery lasts ten hours between charges, and while there's no fast charging, that really isn't a big omission in this scenario.</p><p>It comes in a hard shell case that's rugged, and the camera itself is built like a tank. The lens has a protective cover that's handy, and you can easily save readings to a MicroSD card. Overall, this is a professional testing tool if you need to monitor thermals or identify leaks, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Thermal-512%C3%97384-Resolution-Imaging/dp/B0F5461RX3">at $299 it is a good value</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

I use the brand's phone cases, and its PolarCircle charger is pretty cool; it has the Qi 2 standard and connects to the back of any phone with a magnetic case, and there's a built-in kickstand that lets you use the phone while it's charging.</p><p>But the best feature has to be the built-in cooling solution. There's a fan that blows cool air, and it also utilizes "TEC semiconductor cooling" to ensure the contact point stays cool. This allows consistent 15W charging, and after using it with my iPhone 16 Pro Max a few dozen times, I'll admit that there's no overheating whatsoever. I notice some heat while using other Qi 2 chargers, but that just isn't the case with the PolarCircle. The Qi 2 charger is usually $59, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-PolarCircle-Mag-Safe-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B0DGLM5BCV">you can still get it at $44</a> provided you act right now.

The innovative cooling system is the biggest advantage to this charger, and it ensures the phone doesn't overheat even while gaming. Oh, and there's a built-in kickstand as well. </p><p><strong>Other retailers: </strong><a href="https://torraslife.com/products/polarcircle-qi2" data-dimension112="3b6f12a6-eea5-4f7e-a389-eade5963487f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension25="$44"><strong>$49 at Torras</strong></a></p><p><strong>‚úÖRecommended if: </strong>You need a powerful Qi 2 charger that lets you play games while your phone is charging. </p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if: </strong>You need a Qi 2 power bank instead. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-PolarCircle-Mag-Safe-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B0DGLM5BCV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="3b6f12a6-eea5-4f7e-a389-eade5963487f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $49 at Torras" data-dimension25="$44">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The PolarCircle does a great job delivering a consistent 15W charge. While it is bulkier than other Qi 2 chargers I used, you can still take it around anywhere with ease. You get a 2m USB-C to USB-C cable in the package, and the built-in kickstand at the back is a welcome addition. The kickstand swivels 360 degrees, so you can easily position the charger as needed.</p><p>The unique cooling solution is designed to ensure there's no overheating, and I tested it while gaming. It does a terrific job ensuring the phone stays cool even during marathon gaming sessions, and that in itself is a huge deal. If nothing else, I'd suggest getting the PolarCircle just for its cooling abilities ‚Äî the Qi 2 charging is just an added bonus. It is costlier than other Qi 2 chargers, but the cooling mechanism combined with the kickstand makes it worth the price ‚Äî <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TORRAS-PolarCircle-Mag-Safe-Magnetic-Semiconductor/dp/B0DGLM5BCV">particularly at the deal price</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

I'm not saying you <em>need </em>to own three smartwatches, as that can be pretty pricey and not everyone has that kind of money. Fortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Prime Day</a> is here to alleviate some of that financial pressure, and if you <em>can </em>afford multiple, then I suggest you go for it: one for everyday use, one for the gym, and one for special occasions.</p><p>Depending on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> you own, it's possible that it can play all roles, but some are better suited for certain situations than others. I find myself switching what I'm wearing depending on where I'm going and what I'm doing, which made me realize that it's hard for one watch to do it all.</p><p>Here are my Prime Day picks for the three smartwatches I think you should consider.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</h2><p>The Galaxy Watch 5 has lasted me for quite a while, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Watch 7</a> improves on everything I love about the Watch 5.

The projector has one of the brightest projectors in this category, and the ultra short throw nature of the lens means you can put it right next to a wall and get a 150-inch projection ‚Äî no ceiling mount necessary.</p><p>It has the best picture quality of any projector I used, and the software has exclusive extras, including ambient backgrounds. I used the Aura 2 daily for the last six months, and it has been incredible. While it's still a high-end purchase, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH8WJQZN">down to $2,149 on Amazon</a> until July 12, making it that much more affordable. With the last day of Prime Day rolling around, take a look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-in-4117118656319645735-20">all the deals still available</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b0c558d4-7c4b-476a-9465-a1b819d05b4c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension25="$2149" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH8WJQZN/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.93%;"><img id="BTNUmM35Qa8oYSTLumhJoK" name="XGIMI Aura 2" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BTNUmM35Qa8oYSTLumhJoK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="839" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Aura 2 is the best UST projector I've used. It is considerably smaller than other models, has an elegant design, gets incredibly bright even in a well-lit room, and is extremely easy to set up and use. You get Android TV out of the box, and the only issue with this projector is that you don't get Netflix. But if you're willing to use a Google TV box, this is the best projector deal around. </p><p><strong>Other retailers: </strong><a href="https://us.xgimi.com/products/aura-2" data-dimension112="b0c558d4-7c4b-476a-9465-a1b819d05b4c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension25="$2149"><strong>$2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1887418-REG/xgimi_wm03b_aura_2_2300_lumen_uhd.html"><strong>$2,699 at B&H Photo</strong></a></p><p><strong>‚úÖRecommended if: </strong>You want a 4K laser projector with Dolby Vision. I used the Aura 2 for the better part of six months now, and it has been incredible. It's a considerable upgrade over the Aura, and it gets brighter than every other UST projector I used. You get auto keystone and autofocus, and it has an auto-closing cover that protects the lens when not in use. </p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if: </strong>You want Netflix pre-installed, or don't need a UST model. If you want to set up a standard ceiling-mounted option, I suggest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Enhanced-Portable-Intelligent/dp/B0DDQ66B6L">getting the Horizon S Max at $1,519</a>. </p><p><strong>Alternate deal: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/NexiGo-Tri-Color-Projector-Adoption-Speakers/dp/B0CHMMDJN7"><strong>NexiGo Aurora Pro</strong></a><strong> ‚Äî </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/NexiGo-Tri-Color-Projector-Adoption-Speakers/dp/B0CHMMDJN7"><strong>$1,999 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH8WJQZN/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="b0c558d4-7c4b-476a-9465-a1b819d05b4c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension48="Other retailers: $2,149 at XGIMI (with code XGPDAURA2)" data-dimension25="$2149">View Deal</a></p></div><p>XGIMI did everything right with the Aura 2; the new design is striking, and it is smaller than the outdoing model. The best feature is a dust cover that prevents any dust ingress into the lens when it's not in use. This has made maintenance that much easier, and the motorized panel adds a decent flair to the design.</p><p>Picture quality is fantastic; I used the projector to see movies and TV shows, and it excels at Dolby Vision and HDR content. It goes up to 2300 lumens, and I didn't see any problems in a well-lit room ‚Äî it's more than bright enough.</p><p>The Aura 2 is quite good at gaming as well, and I didn't see any issues playing games on the PS5 with the projector. It has latency of 20ms in the gaming mode, and if you want the best UST model in this area, Nexigo's Aurora Pro gets down to 8ms, and that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/NexiGo-Tri-Color-Projector-Adoption-Speakers/dp/B0CHMMDJN7">model is also on sale at $1,999 now</a>.</p><p>I still prefer the Aura 2 because of the design, better color vibrancy, and the auto keystone correction. I'm setting up an ALR panel shortly, but I used the projector against a bare wall and didn't see any issues. XGIMI is using a new image engine with wall color switching, so it dynamically adjusts the color balance after taking the background wall color into account. The Amazon deal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH8WJQZN">bringing it down to $2,149 is only valid until July 12</a>, so if you like the look of this projector, I'd suggest acting now.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The network streaming amplifier is incredible; it delivers 60W of power per channel at 8 ohms ‚Äî going up to 120W at 4 ohms ‚Äî and it offers the easiest way to connect passive speakers to the internet.</p><p>But you can find plenty of other amps that do the same thing. Where WiiM stands out is its ability to deliver multi-room audio, and the ease of use; its mobile app is loaded with features, and it connects to just about every digital assistant and music platform out there. I used the WiiM Amp with bookshelf speakers for over a year, and I'm buying another two units to connect other speakers I have in the house.</p><p>The $299 asking price in and of itself is a bargain, but for Prime Day, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Amp-Multiroom-Streaming-Chromecast/dp/B0CGCLXH4H">get the Amp at just $239</a>, and that's just an unbeatable value.

The 4-bay F4-424 Max in particular is terrific; it has the beastly 10-core Intel Core i5 1235U platform, 8GB of RAM, and dual M.2 slots.</p><p>But where it has a clear advantage is with dual 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports. Basically, this is what you buy if you want to set up a high-end Plex NAS server that will last at least a decade. I used it for the better part of six months now, and it has been nothing short of astounding. While it usually retails for $899, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DB2MF2F9">Prime Day deal brings it down to $674</a>, making it a phenomenal value.

The minimal aesthetic is great, and it doesn't take up much room. I didn't see any issues with build quality either, and installing drives is about as easy as it gets.</p><p>It's the hardware where this NAS shines; the Intel Core i5 1235U platform is a powerhouse, and it unlocks hardware transcoding in Plex ‚Äî if you have Plex Pass. There isn't another NAS that has the same caliber of power in this category, and if you want a high-end server to run Docker containers, Plex, and a dozen other utilities, you'll need to get this.</p><p>While most NAS systems now get a 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, you'll see two of these on the back of the F4-424 Max. What that essentially means is that even if you use the dual M.2 drives to slot in SSDs, the bandwidth won't be the bottleneck. The TOS 6 software is much better as well, and it has a modern design combined with plenty of useful additions, including a native Plex client.</p><p>I've tested dozens of NAS systems over the years, and the F4-424 Max is my go-to choice if you need a high-end server in 2025. There isn't anything missing on this NAS, and the $225 discount is highly enticing ‚Äî but the deal won't last. This is your last chance to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DB2MF2F9">get the F4-424 Max at $674</a>, so you better act fast.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

It's straightforward to change brightness, lighting modes, and set up schedules, and this is where Govee's products truly shine.</p><p>Each bulb has 80-lumen brightness, and if you don't want RGB lighting, they default to the standard 2700k warm white mode. They connect via Matter, and once set up, you can easily change lighting modes via Google Assistant or Alexa. The hassle-free usability and bright lighting makes these the ideal choice if you want backyard or patio lighting, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Outdoor-Dimmable-Backyard-Waterproof/dp/B0DR1SHBT1">20% discount makes the lights that much more affordable</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our¬†</strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Another patent outlined a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/next-galaxy-ring-could-come-with-sensors-to-measure-body-and-surface-temperatures">dual temperature sensor</a> that would still measure your skin temperature but also check the temperature of something else (like a child's forehead) with the <em>outside</em> of the ring.

And currently, Samsung is more focused on sleep tracking for its <em>smartwatches</em>, giving the Galaxy Watch 8 a Bedtime Guidance tool to analyze your circadian rhythm and suggest an ideal bedtime. Apparently, the Galaxy Ring won't support this, though we're still waiting on confirmation from Samsung.</p><p>That's why you may want to skip this compelling Galaxy Ring deal.

The problem is, wireless audio is also expensive. If you're on a tight budget, it's almost always smarter to pick up a great pair of wired earbuds or in-ear monitors (IEMs) rather than waste money on a cheap pair of truly wireless earbuds.</p><p>If you want to upgrade your audio during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Amazon Prime Day</a>, you can do so while spending less than $20 by picking up one of these in-ear monitors. You'll get excellent sound quality and a detachable cable on all three of my picks, and two of them have optional microphones. I love Prime Day deals that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/sony-wf-1000xm5-under-usd200-prime-day-limited-time">cut the prices of the best wireless earbuds</a>, but it's still hard to beat good old-fashioned wired earbuds.</p><p>Whether you need wired headphones for traveling, gaming, or just streaming music on your phone, these are the Prime Day deals you NEED to see before they run out.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1124689220047358064-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Prime Day ends tomorrow!

These are a lot smaller and lighter due to their plastic construction, but you still get a standout 10mm driver. You also have a sleek design with neat gold accents and a replaceable cable.

They're great for throwing in a bag as a backup plan in case you forget your primary audio gear at home. If you grab a microphone-equipped version, you can take Google Meet or Zoom calls on the go without relying on your phone or laptop's awful mic quality.</p><p>I also like wired earbuds because they're cheap ‚Äî you can be a bit reckless with them, not worrying about damaging gear worth hundreds of dollars. Sometimes I'll take these on a run or hike, or while traveling, because it won't be the end of the world if they get lost or damaged. All three of these options have detachable cables, which is great for repairability.</p><p>After you've picked up a pair of wired IEMs, don't forget to buy a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter. I wish the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> still had a headphone jack, but that's a story for another day.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="46d68836-db15-44b7-8193-3d28b9f7b621" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension48="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Headphone-Converter-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B082WG5VTK/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="dcJtXzMHdEVa5scBJi6SqF" name="UGreen-USBC-Audio-Adapter" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dcJtXzMHdEVa5scBJi6SqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Headphone-Converter-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B082WG5VTK/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="46d68836-db15-44b7-8193-3d28b9f7b621" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension48="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$9.99</del> <strong>$7.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>This tiny and cheap adapter will turn your device's USB-C port into a 3.5mm port for easy, wired connection to any of the earbuds on this list. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Headphone-Converter-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B082WG5VTK/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="46d68836-db15-44b7-8193-3d28b9f7b621" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension48="Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Adapter: $9.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-72">Prime Day 2025 Android deals ‚Äî quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-7144284460815907008-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day ENDS tomorrow: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1125421941494451889-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2331615209002580149-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9655087999259234463-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-3558196267450012492-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><em><strong>ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

And it's even worse when you combine the two, such is the case with a lot of these newer retro gaming handhelds. Since there are so many to choose from, and Prime Day 2025 in full swing, I figured it'd be a good time to share five of my current favorites.</p><p>The great thing about having so many options is that there are a bunch of different designs to choose from. Especially since we've been seeing a resurgence in clamshell handhelds since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RG35XXSP-Handheld-3-5-inch-Simulators-Protector/dp/B0F2T4JFQ5/">RG35XXSP</a> last year. Now, we have options like the RG34XXSP, which includes dual joysticks, an excellent hinge, and is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RG34XXSP-Foldable-Handheld-Joystick-Bluetooth/dp/B0F6KCMWB2"><strong>on sale for 15% off</strong></a> on Prime Day.</p><p>But that's not the only option, as we have the classic Miyoo Mini Plus, which has been around for the past few years and can be had for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Console-Classic-Consoles-Wireless-Handheld/dp/B0DC6QHQ3Y/"><strong>under $50</strong></a>. Then there's the TrimUI Brick, which is more powerful than the Miyoo Mini Plus and has one of the best screens I've ever used on a retro handheld. Oh, and it's also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Console-Multiple-Classic-Emulators-System-Purple/dp/B0F3D7GMGQ"><strong>on sale for 10% off</strong></a> over at Amazon.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9067931038562183873-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><em><strong>Prime Day ends tomorrow night!

But that front clip-on and cable tether will stand out, like a strip of tape on a movie nerd's broken glasses, so it's best suited for (say) a long nature walk where you don't care as much about style.</p><p><strong>‚úÖRecommended if: </strong>You want to extend your Ray-Ban Meta battery life, don't mind carrying the charging case around with you, and have a darker pair on which the cable won't stand out too much.</p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if: </strong>You'd rather buy the version that drains your phone battery, or you'd rather let your glasses die then make them look too dorky with a cable attached.</p><p>I obviously can't tell you if this mod will work without having tried it myself, nor if the cable is long enough to keep the charging case in your pocket as you walk. But I appreciate this unique and clever approach to solving the battery problem with my glasses, and I'm hopeful it'll solve my problems.</p><p>Eventually, I'm going to look into Meta Oakley glasses, which have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-glasses-vs-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">doubled battery life over the Ray-Ban Metas</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/this-could-be-our-first-look-at-the-next-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">leaked 3rd-generation Ray-Ban Metas</a> that are supposed to have "significantly longer battery life" than my current pair.

According to this executive, the company is looking at launching its next tablets, the Galaxy Tab S11 series, "shortly." The unnamed source didn't give specifics; however, they state the tablets will see a launch timeframe close to Samsung's "traditional cadence."</p><p>The publication's source stating the launch adheres to Samsung's "traditional" cadence seems a little strange. It sounds like they're referring to its launch timeframe but, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-is-here-but-one-major-thing-is-missing">other than the Galaxy Tab S10</a>, its recent tablets have launched earlier in the year.</p><p>The last series debuted in September (Sept. 26 to be specific), which was a one month shift from the Galaxy Tab S9 and seven month difference for the S8 series. The latter debuted in February 2022, while the former appeared in August 2023.</p><p>The publication speculates we should see the Tab S11 in September again this year, which sounds more plausible, unless Samsung stuns us with an August reveal.</p><h2 id="the-tab-s11-could-switch-up-the-series-again-2">The Tab S11 could switch up the series (again)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-empty-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra - Empty Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Tab S11 rumor trail goes back a few months, but its most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-surfaces-stronger-mediatek-database-leaks">leak claims the Ultra model</a> will debut with a powered-up chip. The Tab S11 Ultra was reportedly spotted running through Geekbench for its performance test; however, it was listed with a MediaTek chip: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9400-plus-soc-launch">Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC</a>. This is MediaTek's refreshed response to Qualcomm's flagship, the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>Strangely, reports said the tablet scored "lower than smartphones" despite rocking this flagship chip. The SoC features a strong GPU that helps facilitate "PC-like" graphical performance on mobile devices.</p><p>Also, with the Tab S11 series (hopefully) coming up, rumors have stated Samsung is switching things up by returning the base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">and dropping the Plus</a>. We were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/hey-samsung-wheres-the-galaxy-tab-s10">already looking around</a> for the base Galaxy Tab S10 after Samsung only gave us a Plus and Ultra. Now, we're just confused. Regardless, Tab S11 is rumored to feature a 8,160mAh battery, while the Ultra could jump to  ~11,374mAh this year.</p><p>Earlier rumors suggested Samsung would save the Tab S11 series for a launch after Unpacked, meaning sometime in the fall. So, perhaps its debut will mirror the Tab S10 after all.</p><ul><li><strong>Tablet deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ipad-tablets-ereaders/tablets/pcmcat209000050008.c?id=pcmcat209000050008"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=tablet"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/tablets-laptops-computers-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablet&crid=2HCFROTF588S1&sprefix=tablet%2Caps%2C159&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/tablet"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong></strong></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

In an accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/16126339?hl=en&ref_topic=16079905&sjid=14845917384801852633-NA&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1">support page</a>,  Google says users can then add a text description into the box, informing the AI of <em>how </em>they want the video to be generated.</p><p>The post states users should be as descriptive as possible, detailing the scene and "any audio instructions" to Gemini. After finishing, users should navigate beneath the text box to <strong>More > Veo > Submit.</strong></p><p>These clips won't be full-length YouTube-esque videos, mind you. Gemini will only generate video clips that are eight seconds long. Additionally, it may take Gemini a minute or two before you receive your clip.</p><p>There are some limitations here, such as the number of videos subscribers can create.</p><h2 id="gemini-veo-3-2">Gemini & Veo 3</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KqaKDhwTW1Q" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>After completing, Google says users can download Gemini's generated video and share it with others. Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers "globally" can expect the feature to start appearing today (July 10) in Gemini. What's more, the post says users can expect these same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-introduces-new-ai-tools-to-help-creatives-direct-like-a-pro">photo-to-video capabilities in Flow</a>, too.</p><p>Google also highlights its commitment to safety with its AI tools, stating that it's taken "significant steps" to ensure an "appropriate experience."</p><p>What's funny about this "new" feature rolling out in Gemini today is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-400-series-to-debut-google-cloud-powered-ai-image-to-video-feature">we've seen before</a>. In May, Google launched five second clip generation capabilities using its Google Cloud AI-powered software for the Honor 400 series. The feature works the same way as what you'll find in Gemini, turning regular photos into animated clips. What key difference was the launch on Honor's 400 series came with the Veo 2 model, and later required a Google subscription for continued use.</p><p>Veo 3 was shining <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-3-youtube-shorts-integration-creator-creativity-report">highlight during I/O 2025</a>, as Google detailed its audio capabilities and lifelike video strength. As Gemini picks up its prowess for breathing animation into photos, YouTube was also interested in bringing Veo 3 into the fold for Shorts.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, I'm not really a fan of using a mouse and keyboard, as a good controller goes a long way. For the better part of the past year, there's been one controller on my desk, and it's currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZhttps://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ"><strong>$20 off</strong></a><strong> </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ"><strong>for Prime Day</strong></a>.</p><p>Obviously, we're not strangers to GameSir, but until I got the Super Nova, I never really considered them for anything other than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">mobile gaming</a>. At the time, I was using my Xbox Elite Series 2 Core, but the rubber grips had started to wear off, and something was going on with the left joystick.</p><p>But I've always been a sucker for Xbox controllers, so I figured I would end up just buying another one to replace it. Almost a year later, and that has not happened, with the Super Nova still being docked right on my desk.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1316556028087985621-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE: See the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="223d9e37-812a-4eff-b505-c0aada28922a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="GameSir Super Nova:" data-dimension48="GameSir Super Nova:" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="8rC5NWQMzPfroLRfjkJfh4" name="gamesir-super-nova-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8rC5NWQMzPfroLRfjkJfh4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>GameSir Super Nova:</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DCLD9PLY%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1329189071882698668-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="223d9e37-812a-4eff-b505-c0aada28922a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="GameSir Super Nova:" data-dimension48="GameSir Super Nova:" data-dimension25=""> </a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Rubberized-Lighting-Charging/dp/B0DPMGDZLZ" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><del>$59.99</del> <strong>$39.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>There are a lot of controllers out there, even from GameSir itself, but the Super Nova remains my favorite of the bunch.

It probably won't take long to realize why I might like this, since it's basically the same design as Microsoft's controller, down to the rubberized grips.</p><p>The controls are all nice and responsive, and I don't even feel the need to install GameSir's Nexus app on my PC. Part of that is because I'm pretty basic and don't really use things like the paddle controls on the back. What I do use, however, are the trigger switches. This shortens the travel distance before the input is recognized, and is an absolute necessity when I'm playing Call of Duty.</p><p>And on top of all of that, I never have to worry about plugging in or replacing batteries, as the Super Nova comes with a charging dock. So when I'm done playing, I just put it back on the dock until the next gaming session rolls around.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-97">Prime Day 2025 Android deals ‚Äî quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9764014712696558246-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE July 8-11: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-6188859583910098122-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-3325142520077420800-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables:¬†</strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4166824583098299148-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1424464865141903563-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†</em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
