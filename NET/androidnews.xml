                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is rolling out a new PDF viewer for the Files by Google app, as it shared in a recent update to the app's Play Store listing.</li><li>The old PDF viewer incorporated Google Drive, but now, the new one is specific to Google Files.</li><li>It's easier to share, star, and take actions while viewing a PDF while using the new Files by Google interface.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Files by Google is getting a minor upgrade that could improve your PDF viewing experience. The app is rolling out a new view that leverages a custom PDF viewer, rather than using the integrated one from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drive">Google Drive</a>. This will make accessing certain options easier, such as starring a PDF or sharing it with others. Alternatively, you can still use the PDF viewer in the Google Drive app if you prefer the previous user-interface.</p><p>Google previewed the change in an update to the "What's new" section of the Files by Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files&pli=1" target="_blank">app listing on</a> the Google Play Store. "Over the next few weeks, we’re rolling out improvements to your experience with PDF files," the note reads. "Print, find content, or access markup tools whenever you open a PDF in the Files app."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/16/files-by-google-pdf-viewer/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> first spotted that the change was rolling out to users of version 1.5687 of the Google Files app after a server-side tweak. Android Central confirmed the new PDF viewer on its devices, but notably, one device had to be updated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> before the change took effect.</p><p>You can see the new look of the PDF viewer in Files by Google in the screenshots below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JS8osd24PJZhzVjAhtSUdM" name="Files-PDF-Viewer" alt="A PDF opened in the Files by Google app on various versions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JS8osd24PJZhzVjAhtSUdM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">From left to right: Old PDF viewer, new PDF viewer, new PDF viewer + overflow menu. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, the overflow menu lets you access key options that weren't available using the previous UI. With the old version, some menu buttons were only accessible through the list view of documents in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/files-by-google-gains-receive-floating-action-button">Files by Google app</a>. They weren't there after the PDF was opened using the external Drive viewer, but that has been rectified with the new Files by Google custom PDF viewer.</p><p>The <strong>Find</strong> and <strong>Save to Drive</strong> icons have been replaced with <strong>Star</strong> and <strong>Share </strong>on the new viewer. These can be pressed without opening the overflow menu. The new overflow menu includes more options, including <strong>Use as</strong>, <strong>Open with</strong>, <strong>Move to Trash</strong>, <strong>Move to</strong>, <strong>Copy to</strong>, <strong>Move to Safe folder</strong>, <strong>File info</strong>, <strong>Find in file</strong>, and <strong>Print</strong>.</p><p>Finally, the markup button (floating action button) has been redesigned, and some files will have a <strong>Google Lens</strong> button above it that quickly opens <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> QPR2 Beta 2 update is rolling out to testers on eligible Pixel devices starting today, Dec. 16, Google announced in a Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1hftm6b/android_15_qpr2_beta_2_now_available/" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Android Beta Program subreddit. The update includes a variety of bug fixes and other improvements; however, the exciting part of Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2 is what wasn't officially announced.</p><p>A few work-in-progress features spotted in earlier versions of Android 15 beta releases now appear to be functional. For starters, the Linux Terminal app for Android is now working in Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2. The new app was first spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-1-pixel-test-start">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1</a>, but didn't work — it would crash after trying to load a new virtual machine. Now, in Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2, the app can download, configure, and run instances of Linux using the Android Virtualization Framework.</p><p>Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2 testers confirmed the Linux Terminal app worked after upgrading, and so did Android expert Mishaal Rahman in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1868798147989844270" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter). It isn't the only previously-covered feature to appear as part of the update. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-has-a-new-trick-to-put-a-damper-on-annoying-app-pings#:~:text=You%20can%20find%20notification%20cooldown,it%20can%20be%20super%20annoying.">Notification cooldowns</a>, which were originally thought to be an Android 16 feature, are also working in Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2.</p>

<p>The update is available now for the Pixel 6 series, Pixel 7 series, Pixel 8 series, and Pixel 9 series, and the Pixel Fold and Pixel Tablet. You can enroll in the Android Beta Program to receive beta Android 15 QPR2 updates over the air, or install the update manually. You can join the program via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://g.co/androidbeta" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p><p>Google notes that it can take up to 24 hours for the update to appear, and you can manually check for an update by navigating to <strong>Settings > System > System updates</strong>.</p><p>The build number for Android 15 QPR2 Beta 2 is <strong>BP11.241121.010</strong>, and it carries an update size raining from megabytes to a few gigabytes, depending on your device model. It fixes the following bugs, per Google's release notes:</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Before the Google Pixel 9 series was officially revealed, I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4-rumors">already looking ahead to the Pixel 10</a>. That’s because the Pixel 10 is expected to gain a major performance boost since the Tensor G5 chip is expected to be fabricated using TSMC’s 3nm process. To my surprise, Google managed to ship a quite compelling product in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>. Regardless, the Pixel 10 is still something to be excited about — even with this new wild card.</p><p>There’s a part of your smartphone that is absolutely crucial to how you use it to connect with others, access your favorite apps and sites, and more. It’s also one you probably don’t think about often: the modem. According to Android Authority, Google is reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tipped-to-bring-mediatek-5g-modem-to-pixel-10-series" target="_blank">exploring a switch from Samsung modems to a MediaTek modem on the Pixel 10</a>, and it could have significant implications.</p><p>High-speed, reliable 5G modems are hard to come by, and only a few companies in the world can make them. Qualcomm dominated the space for years and still dominates to an extent. However, due to cost and other reasons, smartphone manufacturers have been trying to move away from Qualcomm modems.</p><p>That leaves Samsung and MediaTek as the only other companies with the capabilities of producing a modern 5G modem. That is, unless it wanted to make its own. Apple is an example of how difficult it is to take that path to building a new modem. It got a head start by purchasing Intel’s mobile modem business in 2019, and five years later, it is still trying to build one reliable and competitive enough to best the Qualcomm ones it uses in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review" target="_blank">iPhone 16 series</a>.</p><p>That’s why it isn’t all that surprising that Google probably won’t make a modem in-house. Developing a custom system-on-a-chip, like Google’s Tensor series, is a different thing entirely. Modems can make or break the smartphone experience, and every switch carries the risk of potential disaster.</p>

<p>For years, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-details-pixel-9-modem-security-improvements">Google has used Samsung modems in Pixel phones</a>. The move correlated with the shift to Google’s in-house Tensor processor, which is fabricated by Samsung. The idea is simple — it’s easy to use an Exynos modem with an Exynos chip. The newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> all use Exynos modems to this day, likely for that reason.</p><p>However, all signs point to the next Tensor G5 chip being fabricated by a company other than Samsung. In fact, it’s nearly a lock that the Tensor G5 will be produced using TSMC’s advanced 3nm process node. Back in July, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Google reportedly gave the green light to manufacture the Tensor G5</a> on TSMC’s 3nm process. If easy integration and cost were reasons for Google using Samsung modems, they wouldn’t be applicable to future Pixels now that Google is moving away from using Samsung Foundry for Tensor chipmaking.</p><p>That means Google is poised to make a switch, and its choice will be an interesting one. After all, only a handful of brands use external modems. Qualcomm integrates its modems with its systems-on-a-chip, so any phone using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> processor will also feature a Qualcomm modem. So, Google could purchase an external modem from either Samsung, Qualcomm, or MediaTek to pair with its Tensor G5 chip.</p><p>Google reportedly settled on MediaTek, specifically on using an unannounced MediaTek T900 modem in the Pixel 10 series. Per the report, it considered a few options, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-x75-5g-modem">Qualcomm’s X75 modem</a>, in its upcoming phones. It’s unclear what led Google to decide on MediaTek modems, but efficiency and cost are presumably two large factors. The tight integration between Samsung’s 5G modems and Google’s Tensor processors can be partially attributed to the excellent efficiency and battery life offered by Pixel phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ppx2XnXUjksHgLDqz4RePJ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-10.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ppx2XnXUjksHgLDqz4RePJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s impossible to say how the MediaTek T900 modem will perform compared to the top options from Samsung and Qualcomm, considering it’s not even available yet. Additionally, since MediaTek, Samsung, and Qualcomm all integrate their in-house modems with their SoCs, there isn’t a lot of data covering how they’d perform as external modems.</p><p>With that caveat in mind, there’s still an adage that I think applies in this case: if it ain’t broke, don’t fit it. Google has found a great balance between 5G performance and efficiency with its current Samsung Exynos modems, and disrupting that carries a huge risk. Of course, it was probably inevitable since Google would disrupt the easy integration of Samsung-produced chips and modems when it moved to TSMC on the Tensor G5.</p><p>In that case, why not shoot for the best and use Qualcomm modems? The Qualcomm X75 is still clearly the industry standard for 5G modem technology, and it’s found inside the iPhone 16 series. Crucially, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/08/qualcomm-achieves-world-s-fastest-5g-downlink-with-sub-6-ghz-ban" target="_blank">the X75 achieved the world record</a> for the fastest 5G downlink. It’s an absolutely fantastic modem that’s reliable, and it beats anything that MediaTek, Samsung, and Apple currently have the ability to make.</p><p>I'll reiterate that while the reasons behind the MediaTek move will probably never be known, it’s likely that cost is a driving factor. In that case, I’m disappointed. Pixel phones are not exactly cheap anymore, and going for the best 5G modem available would’ve given Google even more credibility as a manufacturer of some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>.</p><p>Instead, it appears that Google went the cheap route. Only time will tell whether that was the right or wrong decision. The modem is a part of your phone you hope you don’t have to think about. If this move works out in Google’s favor, no one will talk about the new modem on the Pixel 10.</p><p>However, it’s a move Google can’t afford to get wrong. It could completely undermine the real progress it’ll make with Tensor G5 on the Pixel 10.</p>

<ul><li>TECNO recently held its Future Lens 2024 event in China.</li><li>The company unveiled new Image Matrix that will use AI to enhance images using a multi-layered process.</li><li>TECNO also revealed features that will enhance telephoto images and photos of fast-moving subjects.</li><li>These features are expected to appear in a new TECNO smartphone in 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TECNO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tecno-pioneers-ai-imaging-with-unveiling-of-tecno-image-matrix-and-two-ai-powered-imaging-technologies-at-future-lens-2024-302324650.html">unveiled</a> its latest AI efforts during its Future Lens 2024 event in China, which aim to enhance mobile photography and overcome major pain points for users when taking photos.</p><p>At the helm of these is TECNO's new Image Matrix, which will be the backbone of a new imaging process. The Image Matrix will take a multi-layered approach to imaging, working to enhance a photo at each step. This, of course, starts at the hardware level, utilizing the camera hardware, display, chipset, and sensor to capture the image. The image is then deconstructed using as many as 10 different algorithms, focusing on various aspects of the image, such as noise reduction, focus, tone adjustment, detection, and more.</p>
<p>The Image Matrix takes that information and reconstructs the image using the TECNO Algorithm Process Stack (TAPS), which powers several different image processing engines to enhance speed, low-light performance, skin tone, and more. The final layer is the application layer, where the final output is available for use with TECNO's other imaging features for further enhancement.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.11%;"><img id="FxyZM4ADo5aToQW8n77zUJ" name="TECNO-Image-matrix" alt="TECNO Image Matrix details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FxyZM4ADo5aToQW8n77zUJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1276" height="716" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TECNO is also introducing some unique methods that aim to improve high-speed image capture and zooming. The first, dubbed EVS Dynamic Snapshot, tracks and records the motion of a subject at a high frequency, then combines static and motion image data to ensure that the resulting image remains sharp at the pixel level. This feature is ideal for capturing fast-moving subjects such as athletes or vehicles in motion, promising a clearer image than you would get using traditional methods with some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">other premium Android phones</a>.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9SAvEw1CVds" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Finally, TECNO's Tap Any Zoom feature utilizes a dual prism telephoto design to better frame subjects when zooming in. According to TECNO, a user can double-tap a subject, and the camera will select the appropriate zoom level to keep it in the frame. Additionally, the lens-shift optical image stabilization will let you zoom into virtually any particular section of the frame, keeping the subject in focus with minimal camera shake, even at high magnification levels, to ensure your subject remains in the frame.</p><p>And with telephoto sweep, users can stitch together multiple telephoto images for a high-quality ultrawide-angle image with out the distortion often found in traditional wide-angle cameras. This also makes it possible to easily recompose a shot while retaining a high-quality image.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7SaJOJV46rg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>In the image below, you can see how the photo utilizes both EVS and Tap Any Zoom by automatically framing the biker in the shot while keeping the fast-moving subject in focus. The result is a stark contrast from the image without these features enabled.</p>

<h2 id="coming-soon-2">Coming soon</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, TECNO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tecno-ai-foldable-strategy-interview">announced a suite of features</a> that it's bringing to its smartphones as part of its efforts to bring "practical AI" to consumers. This means focusing on features that will make it easy to summarize, translate, and create content for users. These new camera-focused features are the latest approach to using AI to further enhance its devices, which can help bridge the gap between high-end and low-end smartphones.</p><p>TECNO is well-versed in emerging markets by launching impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget Android phones</a> in regions where consumers may not be able to spend exorbitant amounts of money on tech. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Phantom V Flip 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-fold-2-review">Phantom V Fold 2</a> are just two examples of great phones that undercut the competition by a significant margin, with the latter in particular impressing us with its imaging capabilities. By utilizing AI to enhance camera quality, the company is basically saying you don't need to spend a ton of money to capture a good image. Furthermore, the company hinted that we could see more AI imaging capabilities down the road, although for now, it is focused on bringing these features to market.</p><p>Fortunately, we may not have to wait too long to see these features in action. TECNO says these features will arrive sometime in 2025 on an upcoming smartphone.</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted the rollout of its ChromeOS M131 update for Chromebooks, which includes a "Safety Reset" for users.</li><li>Another major inclusion is Flash notifications: a function that will flash a user's screen to ensure they don't miss important alerts.</li><li>Google pushed M130 for Chromebooks and Chromebook Plus models in November with several AI features and OS-level security tools.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is returning with another update for its Chromebooks with a few new features to shore up its major November patch.</p><p>A Chromebook <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/313128087?hl=en&s=31">community post</a> highlighted the update titled ChromeOS M131, which should start hitting devices today (Dec 16). While this update is lighter than the M130, Google is detailing a feature for Chromebooks called <strong>ChromeOS Back to Safety</strong>. As the title implies, the set of tools is intended to give users a clear look at the state of their laptop's security and ways to improve their online/device safety.</p><p>The primary function of this feature is "Safety Reset." Google's on-device description states Safety Reset will "help remove unwanted pop-ups, fix network issues, and address other unexpected issues." Specifically, this safety-focused refresh can reset your Chrome shortcuts, delete cookies, and temporary site data.</p><p>Google adds that Back to Safety will inform users of extensions they should disable and reset settings that could pose a threat to their device. Moreover, Safety Reset will not touch your bookmarks, history, or saved passwords.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:755px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:79.47%;"><img id="FgnwyKXaaDgjystc3cZXGh" name="google-chrome-os-m131-flash-notifications" alt="Google's ChromeOS M131 brings Flash notifications to Chromebooks." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgnwyKXaaDgjystc3cZXGh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="755" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ChromeOS M131 is also adding a tool to help bring more awareness to your alerts via <strong>Flash notifications</strong>. Added into the Audio and Captions page of the Accessibility settings on your Chromebook, Google states Flash notifications will flicker or "flash the screen when you receive notifications." The company states this feature could be useful for those who utilize screen magnification or for the hard of hearing.</p><p>Moreover, it seems these Flash notifications can be colored. The settings option for it indicates a "flash screen color" with a drop down menu. Google didn't deliver specifics; however, we can see that a user's screen could quickly flash yellow to grab your attention.</p><p>Google also states that light-sensitive users should take caution should they enable this feature.</p><p>The final portion of M131 includes a restyling update for ChromeOS' AI-powered Quick Answers. Google reiterates that these responses provide the user with useful information via summaries, interactive outlines, and document Q&A. A separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/13616580">support document</a> states Quick Answers is accessible when right-clicking and can provide tools such as spell check, definitions, translations, and unit conversions.</p><p>ChromeOS M131 is rolling out today (Dec 16), so users should keep their eyes open as we go through the week.</p><p>This light M131 update adds a little more to what Chromebook and Chromebook Plus users experienced with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/google-chromeos-130-chromebook-plus-update-rollout">the huge M130 patch</a>.

<ul><li>Samsung is pushing One UI 7 beta 2 to Galaxy S24 devices in the U.S., packed with loads of bug fixes.</li><li>Among the fixes, beta 2 is correcting malfunctions with the Now Bar, issues with TV product connections over DeX, and more.</li><li>Samsung finally opened its One UI 7 beta program on December 5, which introduced the Now Bar on the lock screen.</li><li>One UI 7 is expected to arrive near or alongside the Galaxy S25 in January.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It seems enrolled One UI 7 beta testers can begin to expect the next iteration of software today (Dec 16).</p><p>Android Central has started receiving the update today on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> bearing software version <strong>ZXL5</strong>. Samsung detailed the rollout of the One UI 7 beta 2 update in its Members app, highlighting improved "system stability." The second beta packs quite a few fixes to bugs that testers have encountered since the program's start.</p><p>According to the changelog, Samsung states it has fixed a Quick Panel operation error alongside a display error regarding the "personal drawer App." Another bug fix rolling in is for the Galaxy S24's wireless connection to TV products through DeX. The company is also fixing an issue where "reminder widget transparency is not applied." However, the company states that an app update is required for that fix to go into effect.</p><p>The One UI 7 beta 2 patch informs users of app updates when the software is available. Tapping "view more" will likely take you to where you can update apps that require it post-download.</p><p>Another bug fix arrives for Samsung's newly unveiled Now Bar. The patch notes state it has corrected a "continuous display error and malfunction" after closing it.</p><p>The remainder of the changelog is as follows:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:424px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:141.51%;"><img id="JfquUBgVZq4QorwKCExB9N" name="samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-bug-fixes-alt" alt="The changelog for One UI 7 beta 2 on the Galaxy S24 series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JfquUBgVZq4QorwKCExB9N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="424" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the update spotted, other users enrolled in the One UI 7 beta program should soon expect it. Additionally, those just getting involved in the second beta can expect a huge 4GB download. However, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-rollout-3509206/">Android Authority</a>, those who've been enrolled since the beta's beginning will only download a 1GB patch as Samsung progresses its development. The publication also cites <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1868601315875787203">Max Jambor</a> in stating the update was spotted in Germany, the U.K., and South Korea alongside the U.S.</p><p>Users can head into the <strong>Samsung Members app > One UI 7 Beta Program banner </strong>to view the full changelog or provide testing feedback.</p><p>Samsung dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">the One UI 7 beta</a> earlier in December after the software faced an insurmountable amount of delays. Based on Android 15, the beta opened access to those with a Galaxy S24 series devices with the possibility of hitting others and a few past-gen phones.</p><p>Galaxy AI is at the core of this beta, with Samsung providing an early glimpse at Writing Tools: a set of AI-based writing and grammar options. The Now Bar was another major addition as users can find it incorporated as a significant feature on the lock screen. Users can view "important notifications dynamically" without opening their phones.</p><p>The stable version of One UI 7 is expected to arrive near or alongside the Galaxy S25's launch in January 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Prominent analyst Ross Young has shared all the color variants of the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra.</li><li>The device is likely to ship in new Titanium JetBlack, Titanium JadeGreen, and Titanium PinkGold colorways next to conventional color options.</li><li>The new ones are presumably sold as online exclusives, while the traditional ones would be widely available online and in stores.</li><li>The Galaxy S25 series is anticipated to launch sometime in January 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's flagship Galaxy S25 launch might just be around the corner. It is assumed to be happening on January 22, although the company has yet to confirm the date. Meanwhile, new information reveals all the possible colorways of the Ultra model in the lineup.</p><p>The news comes from the display analyst Ross Young on X, who has shared the alleged color variants of the Galaxy S25 Ultra model. According to Young, we should likely see the Galaxy S25 Ultra in the following color options:</p>
<ul><li>Titanium Black</li><li>Titanium SilverBlue</li><li>Titanium Gray</li><li>Titanium WhiteSilver</li><li>Titanium JetBlack</li><li>Titanium JadeGreen</li><li>Titanium PinkGold</li></ul>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Updated S25U colors in order of volume:Titanium BlackTitanium SilverBlueTitanium GrayTitanium WhiteSilverTitanium JetBlackTitanium JadeGreenTitanium PinkGold<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1868492364270199211">December 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-25-ultra-color-options-leaked">earlier leak</a> and also a new Finland-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://suomimobiili.fi/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-muisti-ja-variversiot-suomessa/">carrier listing</a> have revealed some of these color options. While Black, Green, Blue, and Titanium were already expected color variants just like the previous iteration models, the new ones that will likely take the limelight might be the new JetBlack and PinkGold. There are several JetBlack enthusiasts, and it could be on the likes of the Galaxy S23's Phantom Black or maybe even calling back to the iPhone 7.</p><p>The Pink Gold colorway, on the other hand, is not new to Samsung devices; older smartwatches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a> featured Pink Gold, and we expect the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra to likely incorporate the same or more pinkish to catch up to its counterparts like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> series.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="X65GexZdyC98NmHwvCEFNJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak-01.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X65GexZdyC98NmHwvCEFNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Young has further shared that the aforementioned color options list are ranked by the number of units, which means the first few are likely to be widely available across online and offline stores, and presumably, the new ones at the bottom are more likely to be Samsung's online-exclusive units.</p><p>Aside from these colorways, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">thanks to the renders</a>, we have an idea of how the Galaxy S25 Ultra would appear. The handset will likely sport a more flatter design than the predecessor model and be slightly lighter to hold in hand than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced Gemini 2.0 last week, its newest set of models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental.</li><li>The experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Flash, a lightweight and fast model, became immediately available in the Gemini web client.</li><li>Now, Google is starting to bring the latest model to the Gemini app, adding support for Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental in the most recent beta update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">debuted Gemini 2.0 last week</a>, and now, the Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model is starting to make its way to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">mobile Gemini app</a>. The full suite of models is yet to be released, as Google is only making an “experimental” version of Gemini 2.0 Flash. The new, experimental model launched on the Gemini web client immediately, but Google said it would soon come to the official mobile apps.</p><p>Only a few days later, Google is beginning to roll out the Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model as part of the latest Gemini app beta, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/16/gemini-2-0-flash-app-android/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Previously, the way to access Gemini Advanced models was to enable an option in settings. Now, with version 15.50 of the Gemini app, there is a new way to switch between models. You can top the model name at the top of the landing page to switch between models and learn more about them.</p><p>Expectedly, Google describes Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental as its “latest experimental model,” adding that it “might not work as expected.” Conversely, Gemini 1.5 Pro is “for complex tasks” and Gemini 1.5 Flash is a way to “get everyday help.” The company clearly wants users to know that this experimental version of Gemini 1.5 Flash is not a final release.</p><p>“While we’re excited for you to try it, remember it’s an early preview and might not work as expected,” the company warned in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. “Additionally, some Gemini features won't be compatible with this model in its experimental state.”</p>

<p>On top of that, the option will only be available to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> subscribers. The higher tier is available through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium plan</a>, which costs $20 per month. Aside from Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, the subscription also unlocks Google’s other top AI models, like Gemini 1.5 Pro.</p><p>You can try Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental today by enrolling in the Google app beta via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox/join" target="_blank">this link</a>. Otherwise, the option to use this model should become available through the stable channel soon.</p>

<ul><li>Early Access program members are getting three key new features for the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.</li><li>"Live AI" will record video and offer AI insights based on what you see, a feature originally shown at Meta Connect 2024.</li><li>"Live translate" will let you hear or see people's Spanish, French, or Italian words in English.</li><li>Ray-Ban Metas also added Shazam integration with the v11 update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> are about to get a major intelligence update, and you won't have to wait if you're an Early Access program member.</p><p>On Monday, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/ray-ban-meta-v11-software-update-live-ai-translation-shazam/">announced the v11 update</a>, with <strong>Live AI</strong> as the standout feature.  Until now, Meta AI could only respond to "Hey Meta" queries by taking a single photo and analyzing it. Now, "Meta AI can see what you see continuously and converse with you more naturally than ever before."</p><p>During a Live AI session, it'll record video and analyze what it sees in real time. You can ask it questions without the Hey Meta wake word, and the AI will remember things you asked earlier. You can also "interrupt anytime to ask follow-up questions or change topics," and Meta promises that the AI will proactively "give useful suggestions even before you ask."</p><p>If that sounds familiar, it's because Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a> offers similar conversational AI, with interruptions and remembered queries. But that's tied to your Android phone, whereas Meta's Live AI will let you ask questions without needing to hold anything.</p><p>During Meta Connect 2024 in October, Zuckerberg gave an example of using Live AI to look at your closet and ask which clothes would best fit a Roaring 20s-themed costume party. We'll have to test how well it works in practice, but the concept is intriguing and a big step up for the smart glasses.</p>

<p>The second v11 update feature is <strong>Live translate</strong>, which Zuckerberg demoed at Meta Connect 2024. As the name suggests, you can speak in English with someone speaking Spanish, French, or Italian and either see their responses on your phone or hear them through the Ray-Ban Meta glasses' speakers.</p><p>Google has offered live translate for years, and in more languages. Meta's version is unique because of its hands-free option, but the translation delay will still make conversations a bit awkward (based on Zuckerberg's Connect demo).</p><p>The final v11 update is <strong>Shazam integration</strong>. You'll simply say, "Hey Meta, Shazam this song," and find out what the music playing around you is.</p><p>If you want to test these features today, you'll need to sign up for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/smart-glasses/articles/voice-controls/early-access-program-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">Early Access program</a>, or else wait for the final release. That link walks you through the steps, but all you really need to do is opt in from the Settings menu of the Meta View app. Otherwise, the stable version should arrive in early 2025.</p><p>Meta has pushed out several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-just-got-a-bunch-of-ai-upgrades-and-live-translation">useful AI updates</a> in recent months, such as the ability to ask Meta AI to "remember" something — such as where you parked — and have it photograph the relevant thing and create a reminder for later.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion AR glasses</a> on the horizon, Meta is wisely pushing out iterative AI updates on its display-free smart glasses for now, getting Meta AI ready for the next generation and challenging Google Gemini and its nascent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">Android XR platform</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google starts the week with a new AI experiment in Labs that U.S. users can start signing up for.</p><p>As detailed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/httpsbloggoogletechnologygoogle-labswhisk/">Keyword post</a>, the newest test for Labs is called "Whisk" and goes about image generation in a new way: by letting users "prompt with images." This is an alternative to writing a detailed description, in case the words aren't flowing. Google explains that its newest model, Whisk, which leverages Gemini and Imagen 3, "extracts only a few key characteristics from your image."</p><p>To get started, the company says users must provide three images for the following areas: subject, scene, and style.</p><p>The AI model is said to consider everything to generate a new "unique" image, like a Whimsical Walrus or an image of a pink donut enamel pin. However, Google warns that its AI only considers things to capture the "essence" of whatever images the user has uploaded to Whisk.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fyFDztZxlEc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Google says that this design is intentional as Whisk <em>will not </em>replicate whatever you've uploaded to the letter. The post adds that certain aspects of your images, such as subject height, hairstyle, and skin tone might vary, too. It understands that these attributes are important to users, which is why Google says Whisk gives users a "review and edit" feature after generation.</p><p>The company adds that this AI model is intended to give users a quicker experience with image generation than the typical methods. Moreover, Whisk lets users "remix" the images they've added to the creation tool for another round of ideas. After an image is created — using Gemini's model — Whisk will create a "detailed" description of what it created.</p><p>Labs testers in the U.S. can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://labs.google/whisk">sign up today</a> (Dec 16) for Whisk and try it out.</p>
<h2 id="new-veo-and-imagen-versions-2">New Veo and Imagen Versions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1041px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.11%;"><img id="AcHCyCZDQgb8JwYuGpsd6B" name="google-veo-2-imagen-3-updates-detailed" alt="Google detailed several updates for Imagen 3 and Veo 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AcHCyCZDQgb8JwYuGpsd6B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1041" height="428" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/video-image-generation-update-december-2024/">blog post</a>, Google detailed new versions of Veo 2 and Imagen 3. Beginning with the latter, the post says Imagen 3 has been updated to produce "brighter" and "better composed" images. Imagen 3 can reportedly follow your descriptions (prompts) better than before with richer details in its final renders.</p><p>The newest version of Imagen 3 is rolling out today (Dec 16) globally in ImageFX in Google Labs.</p><p>The latest updates to Imagen 3 arrive just before the year's end <em>and </em>several months <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-imagen-3-is-now-open-to-everyone-in-the-us">after its (quiet) U.S. launch</a>. Google started making its AI image generator available to users more prominently in August on its Vertex AI platforms. The company touts its safety precautions in place to avoid the creation of illegal or otherwise offensive imagery through Imagen 3.</p><p>Elsewhere, Veo 2 is receiving an update that widens the AI video generator's horizons. Google states this new version of Veo 2 lets users create "incredibly high-quality" videos for a "wide range of subjects and styles." Veo 2 can reportedly reach resolutions heights of 4K and it can supposedly understand more detailed descriptions of what you want.</p><p>The company gives the example of a user telling Veo 2 to utilize an "18mm lens" and states the AI will understand how to replicate a wide angled shot. Moreover, its understanding of expressions, movements, and more help to facilitate a more engrossed AI-generated video experience.</p><p>Google also states that Veo 2's latest updates help it hallucinate details "less frequently."</p><p>Today (Dec 16), Veo 2's update is rolling out in Google Labs' VideoFX and the company is slowly expanding the number of test participants. If you're interested, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google/fx/tools/video-fx">signup on the waitlist</a>. Google then teased its plans to bring Veo 2 to YouTube Shorts and "other products" next year. Plans for YouTube incorporation are something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-longer-content-template-details">we heard about earlier this year</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is prepping for the Galaxy S25 series at an anticipated launch happening in a month, as rumored; however, it isn’t stopping us from wondering what to expect, and the latest report brings back some exciting information regarding the wireless charging capabilities of the upcoming Galaxy S25 models.</p><p>According to the Finland-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://suomimobiili.fi/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-muisti-ja-variversiot-suomessa/">SuomiMobiili</a> report (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/qi2-wireless-charging-galaxy-s25-but-only-with-magnetic-case/">Android Police</a>), Samsung will be throwing in a new accessory with the sale of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series, which brings support for the Qi2 standard wireless charging to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>.</p><p>Although it is entirely different from native Qi2 charging support built right into the handset, it still gets the job done for users who would want their phones to meet modern wireless charging standards with the help of an essential accessory.</p>

<p>While the Qi2 standard has been around since 2023, no major Android OEM has been able to bring it to the mainstream handsets, and the Galaxy S24 series was anticipated to incorporate the feature; however, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-dropped-the-ball-qi2-galaxy-s24">made no avail</a>. Further, the compatible accessories were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">reported to be altering</a> with the S-Pen feature on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>.</p><p>With the latest information, however, things might move around as Samsung is bringing compatible Magnet cases next to traditional protective cases. It also eliminates the need to rely on third-party compatible cases, which caused some issues in the first place.</p>
<p>It also means users will be able to use Apple’s MagSafe accessories for the upcoming trio of Galaxy S25 series if the report turns out to be accurate. Other than the accessories, the report further confirms the launch date of the Unpacked event, which is most probably bound to happen on January 22, 2025 in the U.S.</p><p>Moreover, the regular Galaxy S25 is likely to carry 128GB as the base variant, whereas the Galaxy S25 Ultra should start with 256GB as the base variant and go all the way up to 1TB.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-52">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google's next flagship phones are likely to introduce MediaTek's new 5G modem.</li><li>The yet-to-be-announced 5G modem is rumored to be in testing on the Pixel 10 prototype handsets.</li><li>Alongside the new Tensor G5 produced by TSMC instead of Samsung, this might be a new addition to the Pixel 10 lineup.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google might be silently working on the next flagship models—the Pixel 10 series. While very little is known about the devices via rumors and leaks, new information reveals the possible shift of the modem on the upcoming Pixel 10 models.</p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-mediatek-modem-pixel-10-3507964/">Android Authority</a>, which indicates that Google is testing the MediaTek T900 modem for the alleged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> prototypes. While the publication cites an inside source for this new information, very little is known about the upcoming modem, which is yet to be released by the chipset maker.</p>
<p>As the publication notes, Google only has three major chipset makers to choose from for the device's modem, including Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Samsung, unless it wants to develop the modem in-house. This is similar to what the company is trying to achieve with the Tensor G5 and other succeeding SoCs going forward, which will likely be used in the upcoming Pixel devices.</p><p>It is believed that Google has even considered using Qualcomm's Snapdragon X75 modem, primarily used in the Apple iPhone 16 series; however, for reasons uncited, the search giant is likely opting for MediaTek's T900, notes Android Authority.</p><p>The upcoming T900 is expected to be based on MediaTek's M85 IP modem; for reference, the previous iteration, M80, relied on 3GPP Release 16 5G specification. This means that the presumed successor is likely to rely on the specifications of Release 17 5G.</p>
<p>All the evidence regarding the modem is still speculative at this point, and it could be way too early to jump on assumptions about the performance aspect of the modem on the Pixel 10 series.</p><p>On the other hand, Google is rumored to bring at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">four Pixel 10 models</a> next year with the in-house <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">customized Tensor G5</a>, which will be a departure from Samsung as TSMC steps in for the chipset production. The supposed models could include Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>However, the next product launch before the flagship series is believed to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">recent renders</a>/ <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-real-life-images-leak-again">real-life images</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-leak-reveal-every-last-spec-of-the-handset">leaked specs</a> of it already indicate a promising handset from the search giant.</p>

<p>I don't typically use alarms because I hate being jolted out of REM sleep, as if the noise punched me awake and left me sullen and sluggish. Waking up on my own isn't usually a problem, but on days I can't risk oversleeping, I'd sure love my phone alarm to have a target wake-up range, using my smartwatch or smart ring data to hold off until I'm in my light sleep stage.</p><p>[<em>Infomercial voice</em>] But wait, now I can!</p><p>I own the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>, one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> for dependable health and sleep accuracy without needing a subscription. On Wednesday, the Ultrahuman team announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.ultrahuman.com/blog/2024-ultrahuman-holiday-update/">2024 holiday update</a>, including an upcoming "Smart Alarm" PowerPlug feature.</p><p>The feature is still "coming soon" in the app, but Smart Alarm will "sync with your sleep cycles, gently waking you up during light sleep, with wake-up tunes crafted with sleep and music science — ensuring the perfect start to your day."</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-adds-afib-new-app-store-of-powerplugs">Ultrahuman PowerPlugs</a> are essentially optional widgets for Ring Air owners to add niche data like AFib detection, jet lag tracking, Vitamin D, ovulation, heart adaptability to stressors, or pregnancy insights to their normal Today tab. But this new Smart Alarm tool, as the name suggests, is more of a traditional "smart" feature that you'd get on a watch, which I appreciate.</p><p>I'm confident Ultrahuman's Smart Alarm can work. Why? Because I've already tried it...with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a>, which — like most other Fitbits — has a Smart Wake alarm setting that begins looking for a light-sleep stage 30 minutes before your target wake-up. Even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">I hate wearing watches to bed</a>, I tried it during my Charge 6 review and found it worked as intended, avoiding any sudden jolts awake.</p><p>But since I'm the Wearables lead, I switch brands from week to week. <em>Most</em> brands don't offer a similar feature, and Fitbit itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">won't make any more smartwatches</a>. Google, which owns Fitbit, hasn't ported Smart Wake to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, only offering basic alarm scheduling. Most watch and band owners don't have a tool like it.</p>

<p>Nearly any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> (or Apple Watch) will have detailed sleep-stage breakdowns within a few minutes of waking up. So I'd imagine some simple if/then conditionals would make this feature possible: If the time is during the requested wake-up window, check the current sleep stage; if deep or REM, wait 1 minute, then check again; if light, trigger the alarm; and if users hit the end of the wake-up window while still in REM, trigger alarm anyways so they don't oversleep.</p><p>Ultrahuman's Smart Alarm also has the option to trigger an alarm once the user clears their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.ultrahuman.com/blog/introducing-sleep-debt-manage-your-sleep-deficiency-with-the-ring-air/">sleep debt</a>, which I find very cool. My partner doesn't like setting alarms because she has occasional anxious, sleepless nights, but other nights she'll oversleep until she has an hour of <em>negative</em> sleep debt. Ultrahuman's conditional "only wake up when you're rested" alarm would be perfect for her.</p><p>So many brands today emphasize things like sleep coaching or daily energy scores. Imagine if your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> had a conditional alarm that only buzzed your wrist when you hit a high-enough Body Battery score. The same would apply to your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> and its Oura Readiness score, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and its daily Energy Score, and so on.</p><p>I know some smart alarm clocks detect your stage by picking up movement, but those don't work as well for couples since either person could trigger the not-dreaming state. Apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">Sleep Cycle</a> that pick up movement noises with your phone mic may have the same problem, <em>and</em> wouldn't work as well if you use white noise apps to sleep. Basically, I'd rather use a watch's direct heart rate and movement data, and cut out the guesswork.</p><p>Since my partner and I both own Ultrahuman Ring Airs, we don't need to worry about other smartwatches or rings; we're getting this feature soon. But it's my job to care about my readers' needs, too, and I think a lot of people — and the loved ones suffering from their wrong-side-of-the-bed grumpiness — would benefit from more graceful wake-ups. Here's hoping that by the end of 2025, more brands will follow in Fitbit and Ultrahuman's footsteps with smarter alarms!</p>

That's part of my job; if a Google exec scratches his or her butt, I need to see how it affects Google's portfolio and us since we're the ones using these products.</p><p>That means I rarely worry about what other companies, like Apple, do to their users. This time is different because Apple's disdain for consumers and lack of cooperation puts us all at risk, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-and-iphone-users-told-to-pause-texting-each-other-amid-major-security-threat">according to the FBI</a>, which <em>usually</em> knows what it is doing.</p><p>I'm talking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a>. Of course, I'm talking about RCS because it's been at least a month since I had to talk about RCS.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web's longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div>
<p>Here's the deal: if you use an iPhone and message someone else who is using an iPhone, you're good. If you use an Android phone and message someone else using an Android phone, you're good, too. The problem is when an iPhone user messages an Android user or an Android user messages an iPhone user.</p><p>Those messages, using the default messages app built into the phone, are no more secure than the old way of sending a text was. Apple did incorporate RCS messaging into iMessage, but it did it in a way that's not secure and didn't work with Google to sort it out.</p>
<p>This happened because of RCS itself. The tech, in its current form, doesn't support any sort of encryption yet. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/article/rcs-nowin-ios-a-new-chapter-for-mobile-messaging/">It's being worked on</a>, but if you implement RCS using only the current open standards, messages are no safer than they used to be.</p><p>On the other hand, Google <em>does</em> offer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-encryption">encrypted</a> RCS messaging — but only between two Android phones or the Chrome browser tied to an Android phone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-will-now-directly-offer-rcs-features-instead-waiting-carriers">It added this itself</a> because RCS has no encryption method in place.</p><p>Since about 80% of people worldwide who use a smartphone are using an Android smartphone, this was one of those times when Google did the right thing. Apple didn't. Apple offers iPhone users who talk to other iPhone users encryption and tells everyone else to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107676/buy-your-mom-an-iphone">just buy an iPhone</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nvh4Py4UT6CG7cx7uQ7ewT" name="google-messages-rcs-chatting-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Messages RCS chatting on a Pixel 4a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nvh4Py4UT6CG7cx7uQ7ewT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The FBI piping in to let everyone know there is a problem isn't unexpected. In fact, it's the opposite, and I'm surprised it took so long. I assumed exploits would pop up during the first week, just like spam and phishing messages supposedly from the post office did. You (probably) aren't special, and nobody is actively trying to steal your identity and hack your credit cards; they're just trying to steal everyone's identity and get everyone's credit card info. Casting a huge net is an easy way to scam regular people out of millions each year.</p><p>Apple and Google could have, and should have, prevented this. Instead, Google was worried about tossing barbs at Apple and then taking a victory lap even when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">didn't really get what it was demanding</a>. Meanwhile, Apple trudged along and did nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/the-chinese-connection-in-apples-support-for-googles-messaging-platform/articleshow/107784364.cms#:~:text=China%20has%20been%20pushing%20device,a%20condition%20of%20regulatory%20certification." target="_blank">until China said they had to</a> add <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-ios-18-adds-rcs-support-android">RCS capabilities</a>. Apple will always try to appease China when it's easy to do it, just like Google would. Neither side cared about working together to help consumers like us because we were going to buy their shit anyway. 💰🐄</p>
<p>So what should you do? If you live outside the U.S. or Canada, you probably don't have to do anything because you likely don't even use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> or iMessage. People here use them because texts are free, and, well, we just <em>do</em>.</p><p>If you use either, you should stop and switch to a secure and encrypted platform like the FBI says. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">There are plenty,</a> but I'm partial to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/eu-makes-switch-signal-its-messaging-app-choice">Signal</a> because the people behind it only care about making a secure messaging service; they want to hook you on their product by making it great and not tying it to another service or looking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp-now-requires-you-share-data-facebook">sell it off to Meta</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:644px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:44.72%;"><img id="o2JmVcGfDhuGhdDYEdt8tN" name="signal" alt="Signal messenger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o2JmVcGfDhuGhdDYEdt8tN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="644" height="288" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: <a href="https://signal.org/install" target="_blank">Signal</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's easier said than done. You could go through all of your contacts and ask them to switch to another platform, but they're not going to do it. They don't think they need to do it because they might not have thousands in the bank sitting around ripe for the taking, or they don't think they have anything to hide.</p><p>All you really can do is refuse to send any information through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> or iMessage that you don't want the world to read and wish the companies that made these things actually cared about their users.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>It's been long teased that Google was working on an XR platform based on Android, with hardware coming from Samsung in partnership with Qualcomm. Now the cat's out of the bag with the announcement of Android XR, a new platform that's set to power smart glasses and XR headsets not unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro">Apple Vision Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a>.</p><p>According to Google, the platform will launch first on headsets, with Samsung's Project Moohan set to release in 2025. This will enable users to "switch between being fully immersed in a virtual environment and staying present in the real world," not unlike how some of the best VR headsets work. Smartphone and tablet apps will also work, and Google is optimizing its own apps for the platform.</p><p>Google is also testing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>, as we saw with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra</a>. This will use Gemini to provide information about what you're looking at, and it's suggested that visual cues may also be available.</p><p>There seems to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-is-the-most-exciting-new-version-of-android-in-years">a lot of potential with Android XR</a>, which makes it one of the most exciting things to look forward to in 2025.</p>

Gemini 2.0 is taking things to the next level by making it more capable than before, allowing it to better understand the world around you and complete tasks on behalf of the user.</p><p>What does this mean, exactly? This means that Gemini 2.0 is equipped to power experiences like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Astra</a>, which was shown on Google I/O earlier this year. It can visualize the world around you and even remember what it saw so you can recall something later. And with Project Mariner, Gemini 2.0 can complete complex, multi-step tasks for you by understanding what's on your screen, just as a virtual assistant should. We've seen companies like Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">show off concepts</a> similar to this, so it'll be interesting to see how this evolves in 2025.</p>

However, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a>, this could change, as the latest rumors suggest the company might finally adopt the wireless charging spec in its upcoming devices.</p><p>If true, then the Galaxy S25 series will support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe accessories</a> available for iPhones, allowing them to charge wirelessly at the full 15W instead of being subjected to slower speeds.</p><p>That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://suomimobiili.fi/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-muisti-ja-variversiot-suomessa/">a separate rumor</a> suggests that the phones may not have Qi2 integrated into the phones themselves. Instead, the newer standard may only be accessible via compatible cases. This would be similar to what we've seen with recent OPPO phones and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>If true, it's unclear why companies are opting for this method, but given that many users will likely purchase cases for their phones, it may not be a huge deal. Still, it would be nice to have it integrated for those who may not want a case, but we'll have to wait and see what we get when the Galaxy S25 launches in early 2025.</p>

<p>Google's next mid-range phone, the Pixel 9a, might still be many months from launch, but leaks are revealing everything the company is likely bringing to the table. The latest one includes every spec of the upcoming handset.</p><p>The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/12/exclusive-pixel-9a-specs-confirmed-all-the-details.html">Android Headlines</a>, which cites a wireless carrier source and is further corroborated by an unknown source — both detailing the forthcoming Pixel 9a specs in detail.</p>

<p>According to the leaked spec sheet, the Pixel 9a would be incorporating the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-tensor-g4-is-a-key-piece-of-googles-smartphone-vision">Google Tensor G4</a> chipset — the same SoC that powered the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a>. It will be paired with the Titan M2 security processor, and the configurations of the mid-range handset may include 8GB of RAM and 128/256GB of storage</p><p>The device is believed to ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box as opposed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, and, like the flagship series, Google may offer seven years of OS upgrades and security updates.</p><p>The expected dimensions from the leaked spec sheet show that the Pixel 9a will measure 154.7mm x 73.3mm x 8.9mm, making it slightly taller and wider than the previous iteration, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>. The device might also be slightly lighter, around 185.9 grams.</p>
<p>The display, with a 120Hz refresh rate, would measure around 6.3 inches and is an AMOLED screen with Full HD+ resolution and a peak brightness of up to 2700 nits. It is believed to feature Gorilla Glass 3 protection on top. The dual cameras at the back will have a 48MP primary lens accompanying a 13MP ultra-wide lens. For selfies, the handset is likely to rely on a 13MP shooter.</p><p>A slightly bigger battery capacity will keep the lights on the Pixel 9a. It will host a 5100mAh battery with support for 23W charging alongside 7.5W wireless charging support. Lastly, the device may also feature an IP68 rating similar to the Pixel 9 series.</p>
<p>The handset is expected to cost $499 (the MSRP in the leaked sheet) and may be available in Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony, the latter two being the newest color additions. The spec sheet also confirms the model numbers and device availability in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and India markets.</p><p>In addition to the leaked specifications, we have also seen what the Pixel 9a would look like — thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-real-life-images-leak-again">recent real-life</a> images, which are believed to be prototypes.

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a powerful flagship phone at a midrange price; great cameras and stylish design are important to you; you need over two days of battery life on a single charge.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re interested in the latest AI features or long software support; you need IP68 ingress protection in your devices. </p><p>The OnePlus 12 topped our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> this year thanks to a sophisticated blend of thoughtful design choices, outstanding battery life, and Snapdragon-powered performance that could easily rival the best devices from Samsung or Google. </p><p>As senior editor Harish Jonnalagadda points out in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">his 4.5/5-star review</a>, the phone really feels like a culmination of everything that OnePlus has learned over its past ten years of releases. The OnePlus 12 is a refinement more than a reinvention, and in this case, that&apos;s a very good thing.</p><p>Of course, everything isn&apos;t perfect with the flagship. You only get five years of guaranteed OS/security updates (compared to Samsung and Google&apos;s seven-year promise), and you won&apos;t enjoy any of the fancy AI features that have been dominating the airwaves lately. But if you simply want an incredible flagship experience with a record-smashing discount, then this OnePlus 12 deal is for you.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors claim Samsung is preparing to introduce new extra Galaxy Ring sizes, 14 and 15, next year in January.</li><li>There is speculation that these larger sizes could feature "slightly" large batteries, but that remains to be seen.</li><li>A Galaxy Ring 2 patent suggests it could deliver a flexible internal structure and other rumors purport a longer battery life and a thinner profile.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's Galaxy Ring finds itself wrapped in a new rumor that claims there could be more of it on the way.</p><p>The rumors surfaced on X through a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1867578381803327678">Max Jambor</a> who claims Samsung is planning to introduce new ring size options (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-two-more-size-options-january/">SamMobile</a>). Supposedly, the tipster discovered internal model numbers for these extra sizes: SM-Q514 and SM-Q515. Jambor claims that these model names are for Galaxy Ring sizes 14 and 15, respectively.</p><p>Both sizes weigh roughly 3.2 grams and with a diameter of ~23mm and ~23.8mm.</p><p>More importantly, Jambor states an announcement of these Galaxy Ring sizes could occur sometime in January alongside its market availability.</p><p>What's more, the publication speculates that these two extra Galaxy Rings could provide even larger batteries. Currently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Galaxy Ring</a> is available in U.S. sizes ranging from five to 13. This affects its battery as the smallest size sees an 18mAh battery capacity while the 13 variant features a 23.5mAh capacity. Jambor didn't allude to any such changes; however, there could be a chance that the size 14 and 15 rings grab a <em>slightly </em>larger battery.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New sizes will finally be available in January!Size 14 (SM-Q514): 3.2g, 23 mm inner diameter Size 15 (SM-Q515): 3.2g, 23,8 mm inner diameter https://t.co/GSyK3iFLaL<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1867578381803327678">December 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-more-sizes-rumor">isn't the first time</a> Jambor has alleged an expansion in Samsung's Galaxy Ring size selection. In September, a post claimed that the Korean OEM was creating additional sizes — 14 and 15 — but that they would debut in "the coming weeks." It seems things have changed as nothing launched in October nor in November and with us in December, it seems Samsung set its sights on the new year.</p><p>Curiously, this extra Galaxy Ring selection <em>could </em>line up with the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked, rumored for January. Next month is expected to host the unveiling of the Galaxy S25 series. Perhaps, if the Galaxy Ring does make a quick appearance, it will be to announce the availability of these additional sizes.</p><p>The O.G. smart ring has been relatively quiet as all eyes have been on its next iteration, the Galaxy Ring 2, as rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-resizing-patent-discovered">suggest a resizing function</a>. A patent discovered in October claims the next Galaxy Ring could offer a "resizing structure" via its flexible internals that will only require Samsung to create one (outer) ring. The band would expand depending on the size of the user's finger for a comfortable fit.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-2-new-enhancements-launch-rumored">rumors claim</a> the Galaxy Ring 2 could receive an increased battery life and a thinner profile.</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted the rollout of Gemini in Drive, which aims to help summarize a user's folders, documents, spreadsheets, and more.</li><li>Users can write their query for a folder in Drive's side panel or they can navigate to a folder and hit the "summarize folder" button.</li><li>Google recently updated Docs with additional Gemini help for crafting formatted documents while also unveiling Gemini 2.0.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an update for Drive users that brings Gemini into its side panel with new tools.</p><p>The company highlighted the latest update in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/12/adding-folder-support-to-gemini-in-side-panel-of-google-drive.html">Workspace post</a>, stating Gemini can now summarize documents in Drive. Google explains that Gemini in Drive can only answer questions about your "text documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, and presentations."</p><p>More specifically, with Gemini entering Drive's side panel, Google states users can write their queries about a folder before the "@" symbol and the name of the folder; i.e., "summarize the files in @AndroidCentral."</p><p>Additionally, Google gives the example of asking about the "theme of the content" within a folder.</p><p>Writing your prompt to Gemini isn't the only avenue toward quick information as users will find a starry icon button in folders, too. Once you receive this update, navigating to a folder <em>should </em>display a "Summarize this folder" button beneath the navigation bar. Clicking this will automatically inform Gemini of your request and produce the side panel with its generated information.</p><p>There will also be a "suggestions" option alongside the likely ability for users to expand on what they'd like Gemini to surface via the text field.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:993px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.42%;"><img id="z95tR4SwVx4N6fBpCkRfyQ" name="google-drive-gemini-side-panel-folder-summaries" alt="Google Drive is receiving a Gemini update that lets it summarize the contents of folder, documents, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z95tR4SwVx4N6fBpCkRfyQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="993" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alternatively, users can right-click on a document in their list and click "Ask Gemini" for information that way. The side panel expands its uses by letting users drag and drop documents into it instead of the "@" mention method.</p><p>The update started rolling out on December 11 for users under rapid and scheduled release domains. Workspace customers with Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, Education Premium, and Google One AI Premium add-ons will have access to Gemini in Drive's side panel for summarization.</p><p>Moreover, the company states users need to have "smart features and personalization" enabled before this feature is usable. Admins can turn this on by default for users if need be.</p><p>Gemini's capabilities across Workspace have consistently grown, especially through its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-is-tapping-into-gemini-to-whip-up-formatted-documents">recent update for Docs</a>. The AI utilizes a prompt — "help me create" — which is reminiscent of its recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-gemini-help-me-create-public-preview">smart home test</a> for Google Home. Regardless, the Google Doc version lets the AI help users create formatted documents from scratch. The AI can also easily grab files from your Drive and incorporate them into a new file for you.</p><p>Elsewhere, Gmail picked up extra Gemini help via "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-in-gmail-contextual-smart-replies-workspace">contextual smart replies</a>." The update to its AI-generated replies will take into account what's been said in your current line of messages <em>before </em>offering a quick suggestion. Additionally, Google unveiled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Gemini 2.0</a> this week, which prepares to usher in a new "agentic era."</p>

More importantly, the "AI-powered" answers the Assistant delivers will be enhanced by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>.</p><p>Concerning the AI-powered replies, the support document states the Assistant piggybacks off an LLM (large language model) for more "in-depth" answers on general topics.</p><p>The page delivers a few examples such as ones where a user can "learn more about a topic." This involves a wide range of possibilities; however, Google gives the example of learning about animals and their communication methods and habits. Assistant's Gemini-enhanced capabiltiies bring follow-up questions into this Public Preview test.</p><p>After asking, Google says users can follow up with "Hey Google" to throw another query into the equation. Users can also "interrupt" the Assistant's responses by saying "Hey Google" to ask for additional context or to change your question.</p><p>If you're interested in this test, the post instructs users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/12494697">join the Public Preview</a> via the Google Home app. However, access to this Gemini in Assistant test is being awarded to Nest Aware subscribers (for now). Users must also opt into the experimental AI features alongside having one of the eligible Nest devices for this Gemini in Assistant test: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-audio-review">Nest Audio</a> or Nest Mini (2nd Gen) speakers.</p>

<p>Those new "natural sounding voices" can be customized by heading into the <strong>Google Home app > Settings > Google Assistant (icon) > Assistant Voices & Sounds</strong>.</p><p>The company explains that its AI-powered answers from the Assistant are experimental. Google realizes that its software could get things wrong, which is why it's urging users to take caution when receiving information.</p><p>Gemini's appearance in the Public Preview for Assistant accompanies another test involving the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-gemini-help-me-create-public-preview">help me create</a>" prompt. The purpose of the test is to give users an easy way to quickly set up automation for their smart home devices. Through "help me create," users can instruct Gemini to turn their lights on at a specific time or during a specific occurrence, like if they leave the house.</p><p>Right now, this AI feature only works with Nest cameras; however, Google states it is looking to expand its device support.</p>

<p>Shortly after Apple released the third iOS 18.1 Developer Beta, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/magic-eraser-comparison-apple-samsung">I decided to see</a> how well the new "Clean Up" feature would stack up against Google's Magic Eraser and Samsung's Object Eraser. What I ended up with was a thing of nightmares when trying to remove the harness from my dog in a picture.</p><p>Samsung and Google both did a good job, but that didn't come as much of a surprise, given that these tools have been available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">on various phones</a> for some time. Truthfully, I didn't think Apple's Clean Up would be a viable option and that it would just disappear into the night.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ" name="apple-intelligence-prompt-imore.jpg" alt="Apple Intelligence prompt on iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TspK8cw2ucPMRV64qWaxHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As it turns out, the complete opposite happened, as the stable build of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">iOS 18.2</a> arrived this week, packed with "Apple Intelligence" features. Hidden in the midst of the new AI features was an update to the Clean Up tool, which Apple has been apparently working hard to improve.</p><p>After being prodded a bit, the most obvious way to see if Clean Up is actually better was to try it on the same picture from before, using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. Much to my surprise, Apple didn't try to mutilate my dog, and the entire process was a lot easier than I expected.</p><p>Because we're working with smaller objects, there's a lot of room for error when making selections. But after loading the picture and tapping the "Clean Up" option, it was as simple as just tracing a line along the harness. The tool then highlighted exactly what I wanted to have removed before automatically doing just that.</p>

<p>The results were more impressive than I thought they would be, so I figured I would try using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser in Google Photos</a>. Seeing as it's been a few months since the last time I tried this out, surely Google would still come out on top, right?</p><p>Nope.</p><p>First, I tried using Google Photos on my iPhone since it has Magic Eraser. The results were less than stellar, and it took longer because I had to select the harness in sections. Eventually, I got there, but you can obviously see where the edits were made.</p><p>Then, I thought that I might get better results by using Magic Eraser on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. After transferring the full-resolution photo and opening it in Google Photos, somehow the results were worse. There's some weird line along my dog's back, and her ear is even more crooked than normal.</p>

<p>Maybe it's just a fluke or something to do with this picture specifically. So, I did the next logical thing, picking a different picture before using Clean Up and Magic Eraser. This time, I opted for something that would probably be more common — removing people from the background.</p><p>I'm not sure if it's just something that I'm doing wrong or what. However, neither the iPhone's Clean Up nor the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's Magic Eraser did a particularly great job. Both results look <em>fine</em> until you start to zoom in and pixel-peep where the people were removed.</p>

<p>When I started writing this, I didn't really have much more to add, hence the first half of the title. But then I went back into Clean Up to make sure that it actually recognized the entire harness at once and that I wasn't just imagining things.</p><p>So I pulled up the picture of my dog again, confirmed that the harness was highlighted, and then was greeted with the following.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:217.27%;"><img id="L3QyAUes9f2ysAsVYMBbtg" name="safety-filter-leia-iphone" alt="Safety Filter applied after using Apple Clean Up on iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3QyAUes9f2ysAsVYMBbtg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1320" height="2868" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Imagine my confusion when Apple applied a "Safety Filter" to the picture when all I was trying to do was remove the harness. I tried it again, just to double-check, and again, the Safety Filter was applied.</p><p>I understand the idea and premise of such a feature — and yes, it's a feature, not a bug — but this is the same picture that I had already been editing before, and it's just my dog standing outside with her harness and lead attached. So, I'm not even sure of the logic taking place here.</p><p>On the one hand, I commend Apple for including the Safety Filter to begin with. On the other, why was it that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-beta-could-be-just-around-the-corner-with-an-apple-intelligence-like-twist">Apple Intelligence</a> was able to properly edit the photo 10 minutes before, only to incorrectly apply the filter on the <em>same image</em>? It's left me genuinely perplexed, and all I can hope is that this isn't a regular occurrence.</p><p>That being said, even with the aforementioned hiccup, it's tough to argue with the results. In just a few months, Apple has made some pretty big improvements to its Clean Up feature. Now, I have to wonder whether Google will lean on Gemini to improve its own Magic Eraser or if Apple will end up surpassing it.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Nothing's phones deservedly get plenty of praise, but I'm more interested in what the brand is doing with its earbuds. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review">ear (1)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear (2)</a> set a high bar, and the CMF sub-brand is continuing that momentum. I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-cmf-buds-amazing-budget">CMF Buds</a> last year and came away thinking they're the best entry-level earbuds around, and with the Buds Pro 2, Nothing is taking things to a whole new level.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>Just like the CMF Buds, the Buds Pro 2 have a bold design that immediately allows the earbuds to stand out. With most brands still offering the usual black or white variants, Nothing's bright orange and blue hues are designed to grab attention. <br><br>The rest of the design is thought out well; the case is easily pocketable, and it holds the buds securely. I like the dial on the case, and what's particularly cool is that it acts as a control surface. The dial can be used to control music playback and adjust volume, and that's just plain cool — I don't know why other brands don't do this. <br><br>I also like the design of the earbuds; there's a glossy coat on the shell, but the stalk has a matte texture, and that makes it easier to use gesture controls, and minimizes smudges. The lightweight design ensures the buds are comfortable even with extended listening sessions.</p>

<p>There's good connectivity as well, and like the rest of Nothing's earbuds, the Buds Pro 2 are configurable via Nothing X. You can customize the sound, adjust gesture controls, and toggle spatial audio — I didn't see any issues connecting to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>.</p><p>But it's the sound that truly differentiates the Buds Pro 2 from other products in this category. You get a 11mm driver in addition to a 6mm tweeter, and Nothing did a fantastic job tuning the buds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BktLAxCYMCge6bmvGz8MHT" name="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2" alt="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2 buds and case next to Vivo X200 Pro set to equalizer mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BktLAxCYMCge6bmvGz8MHT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In short, these are the best-sounding budget earbuds I've ever used, and the sound quality is equivalent to products that cost thrice as much. Creative's Zen Air are the only other earbuds I used recently that measure up to the Buds Pro 2, and while they nail the technicalities, Nothing's earbuds have a more dynamic and engaging sound. <br><br>There's an Ultra Bass mode if you need a little bit extra in the low-end, and it does a great job adding energy to the mix. While there's no 10-band EQ, you can tweak the bass, mid, and treble in the Custom sound mode, and that's more than what you get with most earbuds. I'm partial to the Dirac mode; this automatically optimizes the sound, and it lends itself well to diverse genres.</p>

<p>There's good noise isolation as well, and while it isn't as effective as costlier earbuds, it manages to tune out low-frequency ambient sound, and that should be adequate to most users eyeing these buds. You get other extras as well, including Google Fast Pair, IP55 ingress protection, ability to connect to two devices at once, in-ear detection, and a low-latency mode.</p>

<p>Another interesting inclusion is spatial sound; the Buds Pro 2 project a wide sound, and it makes a difference. While it's an admirable effort, if you want the best virtual surround sound, you'll need to get Creative's Zen Air — they're better than anything else in the category.</p><p>I don't really have any negatives; the design is distinctive, the fit is great and doesn't cause any fatigue, you get a lot of useful extras, and the sound is the best in this category. Honestly, you don't get anything that's as good in the vicinity of $50.</p>

Vivo turned that up a notch earlier this year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a>; the phone continues to have one of the best camera packages around, and it's only bested by the China-exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a> — no small feat. <br><br>While the X100 Ultra is the best phone camera I've ever used, the fact that it isn't available globally makes it a non-starter. Thankfully, Vivo is addressing that with the introduction of the X200 Pro. The phone has the same 200MP telephoto lens as the Ultra, and it also takes magnificent portrait shots. You get a new 50MP main camera, and while it doesn't have a 1-inch sensor like the X100 Pro or Ultra, it takes standout photos and videos in challenging scenarios. <br><br>Honestly, that's all you need to know about the X200 Pro — it brings the best features of the X100 Ultra to a global audience, and takes photos of the same caliber. That alone makes the phone immediately worthy of consideration, and you get plenty of other extras, including a new design, brighter AMOLED panel, more efficient MediaTek hardware, a much bigger 6000mAh silicon battery, and IP69 ingress protection. <br><br>I used the global model of the X200 Pro for a week, and here's why I think this is the camera phone to beat in 2025.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4mf8Dmh9WsQWaZunAiEZoT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro with Vivo logo at the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4mf8Dmh9WsQWaZunAiEZoT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo unveiled the X200, X200 Pro, and X200 Pro mini in China in October 2024, and the phones made their global debut on December 12 in India. Vivo isn't bringing the X200 Pro mini outside China, but the X200 and X200 Pro are available in global markets, starting with select regions in Asia over the coming weeks. <br><br>I got used to the 1TB model of the X100 Ultra, but Vivo isn't bringing that storage variant to global markets; the X200 Pro is instead sold in a single 16GB/512GB configuration outside China. This 16GB/512GB variant is now available in India for ₹94,999 ($1,120). The standard X200 is also on sale in the country at ₹65,999 ($778) for the 12GB/256GB configuration, and Vivo has an additional 16GB/512GB model that costs ₹71,999 ($849).</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-design"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zmrmHGBeMyDctgucrEd6uT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zmrmHGBeMyDctgucrEd6uT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most Android manufacturers have switched to iPhone-esque designs, and Vivo isn't immune to the trend either. The X200 Pro has a distinctly boxier design with flat sides, and it doesn't look as elegant as the X100 Pro. While I still prefer devices with smooth curves, I will admit that Vivo did a good job with the design; the phone is much more comfortable to hold than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vBwYCNCLpfvTvk9zeSiWfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro next to X100 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBwYCNCLpfvTvk9zeSiWfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Predictably, the camera island dominates attention at the back; Vivo has steadily increased the size of the housing over the last three years as it slotted in bigger camera sensors, and the module on the X200 Pro stretches nearly across the width of the device. I would have liked the interior of the housing to have the same color as the back — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> — but Vivo went with a standard black design. That said, the ring encircling the camera housing differentiates the design a little bit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Qiif6RCHLRxEGXK4QbHyjT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro camera module highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qiif6RCHLRxEGXK4QbHyjT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I got the Titanium variant of the device, and it feels great to hold and use. The dull grey sheen makes the device look understated, and the back glass has a satin texture that's much better than the usual glossy finishes, and it minimizes smudges. The sides are made out of aluminum, with Vivo mimicking the feel of titanium.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Y6UWk6ckM6nqtueygwzfrT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro with Vivo logo at the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y6UWk6ckM6nqtueygwzfrT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design is cleaner than previous years, with Vivo eschewing the various taglines and metal-etched accouterments it added on the X90 Pro and X100 Pro. The overall aesthetic feels mature, and while the grey model doesn't attract attention as much, the blue option is the way to go if you want a color that stands out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8zkhw89siFa3p9RPsTEYfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro bottom view with USB-C port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8zkhw89siFa3p9RPsTEYfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, Vivo put the ultrasound fingerprint module higher up this time around, and I didn't run into any issues accessing it. While I prefer optical modules, Vivo is using a Goodix sensor that's among the best around; it's fast to authenticate, and doesn't have any problems with oily or wet fingers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="trn69VauRJhoReoogNAZfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro design showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/trn69VauRJhoReoogNAZfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming in at 228g, the X200 Pro is one of the heaviest phones I used recently, as well as the biggest; that said, Vivo did a great job with the weight distribution, and even though it has massive cameras at the back, it doesn't feel unwieldy in the least. I now put cases on phones that have flat sides as I don't like the in-hand feel, but I didn't have to do so on the X200 Pro; although it has a flatter design, the beveled edges and subtle curves at the back where it meets the mid-frame make it much easier to hold and use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XMmAYUGcUJyNLiCxQGHTfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XMmAYUGcUJyNLiCxQGHTfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power and volume buttons have better tactility than the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Find X8 Pro, and the rest of the ports are standard: you get a dual-SIM tray, IR blaster, and dual stereo sound. The X200 Pro picks up IP68 and IP69 ingress protection, giving it added resilience against water jets. While I didn't test that yet, the phone fell into a bowl of chutney and came away unscathed, and that's good enough for my use case (I eat a lot of chutney).</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-display"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Display</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kiKVeCohBuJreWwPa2zpuT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kiKVeCohBuJreWwPa2zpuT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The X200 Pro retains the 6.78-inch size as its predecessor, and you get the same 2800 x 1260 resolution. What's different this time is the brightness; it manages to hit 4500 nits in HDR content, and there's an easily noticeable difference in daily use as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ayNsVNG2p8o9qeBJJynXrT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro selfie camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ayNsVNG2p8o9qeBJJynXrT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's particularly great is that the X200 Pro got just as bright as the X100 Ultra in outdoor use, and in my testing, only the Pixel 9 Pro XL managed to outmatch the device. It does a much better job in this area than the X100 Pro, and it's evident when using the phones next to each other. You get the usual LTPO tech, and the phone gets 2160Hz PWM dimming at all brightness levels, giving it a distinct edge over Google and Samsung phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v6CPAGwzkTgvsEn4UHFdwT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro video in YouTube" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v6CPAGwzkTgvsEn4UHFdwT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it doesn't have anywhere close to the same curvature as previous models, the panel has a very subtle curve around the sides that makes it a little better to use. Colors and contrast levels are excellent out of the box, and like all high-end phones, you get a great range of customizability in tweaking the color balance. Vivo has useful eye protection features as well, including an anti-fatigue mode and automatic blue light filter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S8kQMqrrMfvghECSaMh8xT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro backgrounds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S8kQMqrrMfvghECSaMh8xT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a decent selection of always-on styles too, and the phone has a smooth transition from the lock screen to the home screen, which is something you'll see on ColorOS as well. I didn't have any issues streaming HDR content on the phone, and after a dozen hours of gaming, there were no problems in this regard either. The onboard sound is better than the X100 Pro, and you get a good stereo effect.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Uo8jY8eD2r9fYBb2HYmucT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro coating" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uo8jY8eD2r9fYBb2HYmucT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only issue with the panel is that the oleophobic coating is starting to wear out after just a week of use; my daily usage hasn't differed, but the top edge has a visible line where there's no coating, and that's troublesome. By contrast, the X100 Pro has been in regular use throughout 2024, and it doesn't have any issues with the coating. I saw a similar occurrence on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> too, and I'll provide an update once either brand confirms what the problem might be — it could just be the coating that was used on these two devices.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-performance"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Performance</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RwD9p9SHjjW8aZPwcxnetT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro about device section" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RwD9p9SHjjW8aZPwcxnetT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the X100 Ultra switched to Qualcomm hardware, Vivo is clearly intent on using MediaTek's Dimensity on the rest of the X100 series, and that's a good decision. The X200 Pro uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">Dimensity 9400</a> — same as the Find X8 Pro — and it is fantastic in daily use. I didn't see any slowdowns or lag, and it handled gaming without breaking a sweat. <br><br>The phone tends to get a little hotter than the Find X8 Pro, but just by two degrees Celsius. The stability score of 49% in 3DMark's Steel Nomad Light test is on the lower end of the scale, but thankfully, you won't see any jitter even in demanding games, and while it throttles in extended gaming sessions, it still delivers steady framerates. With 16GB of RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage onboard, you don't have to worry about multitasking or storage issues.</p>

<p>Given that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13</a> also runs Funtouch OS and is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite instead, we can see how the two devices differ. Obviously, there's no difference between the two in regular use, but the iQOO 13 holds up a little better in gaming — it doesn't throttle as early. Other than that, you get a similar level of performance. <br><br>I didn't see any issues with cellular connectivity, but calls were garbled at times; I'm not sure if this was down to where I was at the time or the cellular signal, but I don't usually run into this problem, so thought to highlight it. There's the usual LDAC and LHDC codecs in addition to AptX HD, and you get dual-band GPS, NFC, and a USB-C port based on the USB 3.2 standard. <br><br>The new vibration motor has exquisite feedback, and it makes using the device that much more engaging. Overall, there isn't much amiss with the X200 Pro in this area, and it is has one of the best hardware packages around.</p>

<p>Like most other 2025 flagships, the X200 Pro picks up a huge battery, with Vivo slotting in a 6000mAh unit inside the device. It also uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon tech</a> to deliver better density, and the increased size along with better efficiency allows it to last two days. Even with heavy use, I only had to charge the phone every other day, and it's liberating. <br><br>There's no battery anxiety whatsoever with the device, and when you need to plug it in, the X200 Pro uses Vivo's 90W charging standard, and the requisite charger is bundled in the package. It takes just under 50 minutes to charge the battery, and it's on par with the best phones in this area.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-cameras"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gcv2r2ED7YPJ5NVCxBfPfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro camera housing highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gcv2r2ED7YPJ5NVCxBfPfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The X200 Pro gets a new 50MP Sony Lytia-818 imaging sensor with a 1/1.28-inch sensor, and while it isn't as big as the 1-inch sensor on the X100 Pro, it does a great job in its own right. The highlight is the inclusion of the 200MP Samsung HP9 telephoto lens, which is the same one used in the X100 Ultra to great effect. The wide-angle lens is a 50MP Samsung JN1, which is unchanged from last year, as is the 32MP front module.<br> <br>Vivo uses a custom V3+ imaging module in conjunction with the Dimensity 9400, and this allows the brand to eke out better detail with HDR video. The X200 Pro has 4K60 Dolby Vision video out of all the sensors and focal lengths at the back, and the phone does a standout job with video in general. There's portrait video, 10-bit LOG, and a street mode that adds a noticeable vignette to resultant shots. <br><br>The camera interface itself hasn't changed, and you get a decent number of shooting modes and filters. Vivo's collaboration with Zeiss is evident in the portrait shots and tonal balance of the photos, and you can pick between three styles: Vivid, Textured, and Zeiss Natural. The Vivid mode has the best colors, and that's the one I used as default when testing the X200 Pro.</p>

<p>As you'd imagine, there are no issues with photos taken in daylight conditions. The X200 Pro does a great job preserving detail, and you get vibrant colors with excellent dynamic range and white balance. While the sensor itself isn't as large as last year, tweaks to the tuning allows the X200 Pro to deliver a similar caliber of photos. <br><br>The main camera does an incredible job in low-light conditions as well, delivering accurate colors and details. Honestly, I don't have anything to fault with the main camera, and the X200 Pro delivers everything I need — photo quality is always consistent, it does a good job with fast-moving objects, and there's no shutter lag whatsoever. <br><br>The biggest change this time is the 200MP telephoto lens; it goes up to 3.7x via optical zoom and has OIS, and while the increased focal length is obviously useful, where the lens truly shines is at portrait shots. The X200 Pro takes delightful portrait shots, with class-leading segmentation and bokeh. The best part about the mode is that you get to choose between five focal lengths, giving you plenty of options to frame a subject. <br><br>Although the wide-angle lens is an older sensor, it does a decent enough job most of the time. It's only in demanding low-light scenarios that you can make out its limitations, but in all other shooting conditions, it delivers usable photos. The only quibble I have in this area is that the selfie lens isn't quite up to scratch. It's still a decent module and takes good photos, but it doesn't have the same quality as the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Vivo should have switched to a newer sensor. <br><br>Outside of that, the X200 Pro has what is arguably one of the strongest camera packages, and the combination of the 50MP main lens and versatile zoom lens gives it a distinct advantage. I'm intrigued to see what Vivo does with the X200 Ultra, because barring that, I don't see any other device outmatching the X200 Pro in 2025.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CMAJak5jvnm73MHLqYhBtT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro Android 15 Easter Egg" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CMAJak5jvnm73MHLqYhBtT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like what Vivo is doing on the software side of things. The X200 Pro runs Funtouch OS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and it is different enough to ColorOS 15 and its derivatives that you don't feel like you're using the same UI. The interface is clean and optimized incredibly well to take advantage of the hardware, and I now prefer it to ColorOS or MIUI — a big deal considering its iOS-esque heritage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NoLWsGEddpL22HUzmHHarT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro notification shade with music on YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NoLWsGEddpL22HUzmHHarT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't have any negatives in this area; I didn't see any problems with push notifications or errant crashes, and the UI was fluid in the week I used the device. That's just with this device; as mentioned earlier, I used the X100 Pro as a secondary phone for much of 2024, and didn't run into any issues there either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="87ittmsMrz5jmAXkQucArT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro widgets page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/87ittmsMrz5jmAXkQucArT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like every other interface, you get a decent amount of AI-backed utilities, including Circle to Search, AI note summarization, transcribing, and translation. Whether they're actually usable is down to your needs; I don't see the point of most AI tools in their current state, and the only one I use with any regularity is the transcribe feature that lets me convert audio to text.</p>
<p>Vivo does a good job with software updates, and the X100 Pro picked up consistent updates over the course of the year. The X200 Pro will receive four Android OS updates along with six years of security updates, and while that's not on par with Google and Samsung, it is in line with what other Chinese manufacturers are doing.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-the-competition"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tnQFm9H45FUYJfTN2KTfwT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro next to X100 Ultra and X100 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnQFm9H45FUYJfTN2KTfwT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find X8 Pro is the closest rival to the X200 Pro, with both phones featuring the same MediaTek Dimensity platform and delivering standout cameras. With the X200 Pro confined to Asian markets, the Find X8 Pro is a viable choice if you need a device with versatile cameras. While Vivo's phone has the edge at portrait shots and zoom, the Find X8 Pro does a great job on its own. I like Vivo's color tuning better, and Funtouch OS is better to use than the most recent iteration of ColorOS, so the X200 Pro wins out.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need one of the best camera packages available today</li><li>You want a fantastic telephoto lens</li><li>You need a phone that takes stunning portrait shots</li><li>You want class-leading battery life</li><li>You need the latest hardware</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the best selfie camera</li><li>You want long-term updates similar to the Pixel 9 Pro XL</li><li>You need a device that's sold in the U.S. or U.K.</li></ul>
<p>Vivo didn't need to change too many things with the X100 Pro, and thankfully, the brand retained the best features from the device. The X200 Pro has one of the best camera packages you'll find today, and the addition of the 200MP telephoto lens gives it a distinct advantage. The portrait shots you get out of the phone are truly incredible, and while the X100 Ultra still has a slender edge, it isn't much. <br><br>I like everything else about the phone. The AMOLED panel is among the best I've used, the hardware is on par with the best from Qualcomm, and the battery lasts two days between charges. The software is great to use as well, and Funtouch OS 15 delivers a good balance between a fluid UI and plenty of customizability. <br><br>The only point of contention is that the selfie camera isn't quite on the same level as other flagships. And with the phone limited to Asian countries, there's no reliable way to get a hold of it in the U.S. or U.K., and that's a real shame. But if you're in a country where the device is sold by Vivo, you should consider picking it up. <br><br>Having used the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Find X8 Pro in the last three months, I'm convinced that the X200 Pro has the best cameras of the lot, and my SIM is staying put in this device long after the review is done.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp detailed a series of updates for its voice and video calling services.</li><li>Those calling on the web-based app will find a more convenient and easy to use UI when calling alongside better controls in group chats.</li><li>WhatsApp recently rolled out "Message Drafts" to mobile users alongside Transcripts for voice messages.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is detailing several new calling features that users will soon find on mobile and the web-based app.</p><p>The Meta-owned communication service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/improved-calling-this-holiday-season">highlighted</a> the series of updates that will soon hit devices. The updates kick off with the web-based WhatsApp version as the post states users there will find "improved calling." It seems the service is updating the UI experience as it says users calling someone else will find the call button, call link creation, and the ability to dial a number directly more conveniently.</p><p>Selecting call participants is also receiving a bit of holiday cheer as WhatsApp rolls in better control when it groups. According to the post, users can now call specific people within a group chat, instead of ringing everyone simultaneously.</p><p>Video calling is the final area WhatsApp's December update hones in on, beginning with "better quality." The company states calls are "more reliable" and users can enjoy a "higher resolution with a clearer picture" during one-on-one and group video calls.</p><p>This update is rolling out for mobile and desktop users.</p><p>Lastly, the platform detailed additional video call effects. The announcement states users will find 10 new effects, ranging from cute dog ears and nose to an underwater theme and a microphone for singing.</p><p>Users should begin noticing these updates today (Dec 12) and beyond as we end the week. Continue to check to see if your app has an update if you've not seen one yet.</p>

<p>WhatsApp deployed a new update in November that was like the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-whatsapp-message-drafts-rollout">missing piece</a>" for its services: message drafts. These new draft indicators were designed for mobile devices. When writing a text in a one-on-one thread or group chat, and you haven't sent it, users will notice a "draft" label in your messaging list. Places where you started, but didn't finish will be bumped to the top of your list for visibility.</p><p>This is a feature that's been commonly seen in other apps like Google Messages and it's good that WhatsApp is finally onboard.</p><p>Additionally, the platform rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-introduces-voice-message-transcripts">an accessibility update</a> that concerns Voice Messages. "Select" languages started receiving support for Transcripts when receiving a voice message. These transcriptions are said to work with longer audio files and will remain there to return and read later on. WhatsApp adds that the transcriptions are optional and users can turn them off via the settings if desired.</p>

<hr>
<p>Epic Games, creators of Fortnite, have announced a major partnership that will bring its games to "millions" of users.</p><p>Today (Dec 12), Epic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/telefonica-and-epic-games-bring-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-telefonica-devices">detailed its new partnership</a> with Telefónica, a global cellular carrier with strong ties to areas within Europe. Epic states this is the beginning of a "long term" partnership with the service provider as its Game Store will be pre-loaded onto every Android phone it offers consumers.</p><p>Telefónica's Director of Partnerships and Devices, Lorena Itziar Senador-Gómez Lázaro stated, "with this collaboration with Epic Games we strengthen our relationship and go one step further in delivering high-quality, accessible, and innovative digital experiences to our customers."</p><p>Epic calls this a "strategic alliance" as it looks to create a more "competitive ecosystem for Android players." Its statement adds that consumers will now be exposed to more choices beyond the "conventional app marketplaces."</p><p>While Telefónica is quite widespread across Europe, Epic states its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1867152588094771446">pre-loaded app store will concern</a> Spain, the U.K., Germany, Mexico, and Spanish-speaking LATAM on its network.</p><p>Several of the games Android users leveraging Telefónica's cell service will find are Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Epic Games Store will now be preinstalled on Telefónica Android devices in Spain, UK, Germany, Mexico and Spanish-speaking Latam. This will enable players to bypass many of Google’s misleading scare screens and get to playing Fortnite faster. We’re looking to partner with…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1867152588094771446">December 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The companies are reportedly not content with stopping here as 2025 will hold additional ventures into expanded partnerships. Epic and Telefónica will seek to "bring more benefits" to its Android players across its cellular network.</p><p>What's interesting about this new pre-load partnership with Telefónica is that Epic tried to do this with OnePlus and LG, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-stopped-oneplus-pre-installing-fortnite-its-phones">Google stopped it</a>. Google was reportedly afraid that Epic would "install and update multiple games with a silent install bypassing the Google Play Store."</p><p>Regarding the situation, a Google spokesperson provided a statement to Android Central which reads: "<em>Epic, and any other developer, has always been able to work directly with carriers and OEMs to preinstall their apps or app stores because of the choice and openness that Android provides. All that has changed is that Epic understands it won’t receive a free ride on Play, so they’re finally pursuing the options that have been available to them all along.</em>"</p><p>When Epic highlights "conventional app marketplaces," we can't help but look to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/now-google-has-removed-fortnite-its-play-store">storied history with Google</a>. Epic sued Google in 2020 after its popular game, Fortnite, was axed from the Play Store after an update gave players a way to buy its virtual currency, V-Bucks, directly through the developer. This infringed on Google's store policy, where it takes a 15% fee for all purchases for apps listed.</p><p>Things then evolved into a series of lawsuits, where Epic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-loses-antitrust-court-battle-against-epic">won a major trial in antitrust court</a> against Google where a judge found the latter guilty of an illegal monopoly in the Play Store. Epic has continued to fight tech companies — think Google and Samsung — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-sues-google-and-samsung-anti-competitive-case">over anti-competitive practices</a> when it comes to third-party developers.</p><p>Where we're at now is the Epic Game Store's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/epic-games-store-arriving-on-android-later-this-year">arrival for download</a> on Android. Epic is more interested in delivering a "fair" experience for games and developers, instead of being content with Google's large 15% to 30% fee during transactions. Moreover, Epic stated it would keep the same 88/12 split for purchases that it has on its PC client. Developers would retain 88% of a user's purchase, with the remaining 12% falling into Epic's hands.</p>

<hr>
<p>As we approach the Galaxy S25 series, rumors have surfaced about Samsung's next-generation would-be successor in 2026.</p><p>A new rumor by X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1867062057813807362">Jukanlosreve</a> states that Samsung might bring its Galaxy S26 series in-house for its desired SoC (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-could-double-down-on-exynos/">Android Police</a>). According to the post, the Korean OEM is allegedly planning to use its custom Exynos chips "significantly" within the Galaxy S26 flagship series.</p><p>Little else is known about the chip's specifics; however, there is speculation about where it could be applied. The publication suggests Samsung could utilize its Exynos chip in various regions around the world, but stick to Qualcomm for the U.S. market. If true, then it would be similar to what Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-exynos-will-be-just-fine">done in the past</a> with the S24 series.</p><p>That series saw the Exynos applied to markets in Europe, India, and the U.K.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung aims to “significantly” equip the Galaxy S26 with Exynos chips next year.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1867062057813807362">December 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>We might have an idea about this alleged Exynos focus as there was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-starts-work-on-its-2nm-process-chip">a report in May</a> from a South Korean news outlet. The post alleged that Samsung was preparing to develop a stronger, 2nm process for the eventual Exynos 2600 SoC. The SoC supposedly had the codename "Thetis" internally. The report claimed that Samsung was planning on popping the chip into the Galaxy S26 series.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-2nm-process-production-plans">confirmed</a> it was planning on mass producing a 2mn process chip in 2025, an area where it wanted to take the lead.</p><p>Early reports purported that the chip would deliver a 12% increase in performance, a 25% efficiency boost, and a 5% decrease in "total area."</p><p>A more exclusive shift toward an in-house chip could help Samsung keep its costs in a (somewhat) comfortable light — especially following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-alleged-sporadic-price-increase-rumored">a new report</a>. It was recently rumored that Samsung's Galaxy S25 series, which will use Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, could see a "slight" price jump in South Korea. This was reportedly due to a higher exchange rate between the two companies for the product.</p><p>It was stated that Qualcomm's tech had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-rumored-price-hike-sour">risen by roughly 30%</a> compared to previous generations and it could impact regions sporadically. A price hike has been rumored since September, as it was purported that the latest flagship chip leaped by ~$190 for OEMs.</p><p>Early rumors regarding the Galaxy S26 can always change, so take this with a grain of salt. For now, we have the S25 series to look ahead to during its likely launch in January 2025. What's more, a recent claimed the series could boast <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-qi2-wireless-charging-support-rumors">Qi2 wireless charging</a> support.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amid ongoing FBI investigations into a massive cyberespionage campaign, experts are urging Canadian iPhone and Android users to hit pause on texting between these platforms.</p><p>Last week, a Chinese hacking group known as "Salt Typhoon" reportedly stole tons of Americans' metadata, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/large-number-americans-metadata-stolen-by-chinese-hackers-senior-official-says-2024-12-04/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. In response, the FBI is urging people to stick to encrypted messaging and calls instead of texting.</p><p>While messaging within the same platform is fairly secure, texts between Android and iPhone are vulnerable to attacks, as shown by recent hacks linked to "Salt Typhoon," which is reportedly tied to the Ministry of Public Security.</p><p>The hack reportedly hit at least eight U.S. telecoms, giving Beijing officials access to private texts and calls from who knows how many Americans.

<p>A speculative Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16 analysis gives you a better view of which phone is right for you. Whether you're more of a Samsung or Apple fan might tip the scale in one direction when choosing between the two phones. But since the Samsung Galaxy S25 specs are not official yet, we're going to have some fun daydreaming about which phone is better using the available rumors for the upcoming Galaxy phone.</p><p>One rumor we love is about the more powerful processor on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">Android phone</a>. The new processor helps Samsung make its new lineup more appealing. The Galaxy S24 is a great option if you don't feel like waiting, but remember that good things come to those who wait.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-iphone-16-design-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-side-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="Another alleged angled rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has kept its design similar over the years, so it's safe to assume that the Galaxy S25 might also have the typical triple camera stack we expect from Android phones. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design" target="_blank">leaked renders</a>, Samsung will fully unify the design across all three models. The Galaxy S25 might have a similar look to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Rumors suggest the Samsung Galaxy S25 will have a more traditional camera lens with ribbed edges and thicker borders. We're optimistic about the Galaxy S25's design and it having the triple camera design we're used to seeing on Samsung phones.</p>
<p>Rumors also suggest that the Galaxy S25 could have the same colors as the earlier model. The Galaxy S25 could be smaller than the iPhone 16 since the rumored size is 146.94 x 70.46 x 7.25mm. The weight is not available, but since the past three models have a weight of 167 and 168 grams, it's safe to assume that the S25 also follows that pattern. Samsung has not confirmed the IP rating, but the Galaxy S24 rating suggests that the S25 will likely have the same.</p><p>The rumored colors for the upcoming Galaxy S25 include Titanium Black, Gray, Blue, and Silver. There are also rumored thinner bezels users could enjoy in 2025.</p><p>On the other hand, the iPhone 16 only has two cameras stacked on the back of the phone's compact design. It also has a new camera bump, leaving behind the square with offset cameras and going for a more vertical arrangement. It has a revamped ultra-wide camera with autofocus, an action key, and a new hardware button for the cameras.</p><p>This year's iPhone 16 retains the same weight and dimension as last year's model, which is 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm and weighs 170 grams. The iPhone is available in White, Black, Pink, Teal, and Ultramarine. You also get a phone with an IP68 rating, but it's still a good idea to dry it off if the phone ever gets wet. However, avoid spilling harmful liquids such as sugary drinks and cleaning liquids.</p><p>The iPhone 16 has the same aluminum frame as Apple's Ceramic Shield as the iPhone 16 Plus. It also has a frame and glass panel with a matte finish that should help with the grip.</p>

<p>Rumors suggest that Samsung could replace its camera hardware with Sony. The processor may be the more powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset (essentially a rebranded Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip). The Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, with its Oryon cores, will give the S25 a performance jump. However, other rumors indicate that Samsung is saving the Snapdragon processor for the Ultra model and might give the remaining models an Exynos chip.</p><p>According to tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1837452794909086073" target="_blank">Ice Universe</a>, the Galaxy S25 will have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-triple-camera-array-rumors" target="_blank">identical camera setup to the S24</a> model. The camera system could have a 50MP wide primary camera, 10MP telephoto, 12MP selfie, and 12MP ultrawide. The rumored increase in RAM will significantly help if the rumors are true.</p><p>Samsung has held its Unpacked event in January for the last two years, so we might get the official specs shortly. However, if the S25 matches the S24’s specs, we're looking at storage options of 128GB and 256GB and a 4,000mAh battery. On the other hand, other leaks point to a more powerful 5,000mAh battery, sweet! There is also support for wired and wireless charging.</p><p>On the Apple side, the iPhone 16 has Apple's A18 processor, but the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite may not be too far behind in terms of performance. This is very interesting since it's the first time a Snapdragon chip has matched an Apple one, and we're eager to see how the S25 performs against the iPhone 16.</p><p>The iPhone 16 has a 48MP main, a 12MP selfie, and a 12MP ultrawide. In addition to that camera power, it has dual-LED dual-tone flash, HDR, and the ability to record in 4K. Beyond its cameras, you can choose from 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, but it has only 8GB of RAM across all three options. If you're OK with a standard battery, the iPhone 16's 3,561mAh battery should suffice.</p>

<p>There is usually not much of a difference in screen size between models, but according to yeux122 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223385894570&navType=by" target="_blank">Naver</a>, Samsung may increase the display size to 6.3 inches. The Galaxy S25 may also have the same low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) OLED using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1849655264984826017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1849655264984826017%7Ctwgr%5E42e6327bee39bb711c19c964e7f951ab539d0ade%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gadgets360.com%2Fmobiles%2Fnews%2Fsamsung-25-ultra-plus-display-technology-costs-report-6878388" target="_blank">M13 organic materials</a> as the S24. I hope that the S25 at least has the same sharp display and 120Hz as the S24, along with the Gorilla Glass Victus 2. Rumors also suggest we could be looking at a 2,600-nit brightness level.</p><p>The iPhone 16 has a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED HDR10 display with Dolby Vision, delivering great visuals with a resolution of 1179 x 2556 and a density of 460ppi. Apple protects the display with Ceramic Shield Glass, which the company claims is twice as strong as Corning Gorilla Glass Victus. Furthermore, a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating keeps the screen smudge-free, also on the iPhone 15. If you like scrolling at night, lowering the brightness to a single nit is fantastic.</p><p>Apple also equipped the iPhone 16 static panels at 60Hz, but it does not support always-on functionality. The display can reach a peak brightness of 2,000 nits.</p>

<p>Regarding the Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16, which phone you choose depends on whether you prefer the Samsung or Apple ecosystem. However, delaying your decision is a good idea since Samsung has not officially launched the Galaxy S25. Samsung will hopefully release the Android phone soon, but like with every new launch, the phone will likely come with a high price tag.</p><p>Think of it this way: if you wait, you will have more information to help you decide, and the following batches of Apple Intelligence might be out, as well as the official specs for the S25, including the much-anticipated Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. Taking into consideration that Samsung doesn't save it exclusively for the Ultra version.</p><p>You can choose from available specs when you buy the phone and not go on the promise of what it might have.

<ul><li>YouTube TV announced another price hike today (Dec 12), which will see its Basic Plan rise by $10 to $82.99.</li><li>The platform states this will go into effect on December 12, 2024 for new members before hitting "most" existing users on January 13, 2025.</li><li>YouTube TV states this rise in costs is due to "rising content costs," a similar reason given during its previous hike in 2023.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube TV made an announcement today (Dec 12) confirming pricing changes, despite claiming the opposite after an "erroneous" ad.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/YouTubeTV/status/1867236661173612567">a thread on X</a>, YouTube TV explained its mindset and why it has dropped <em>another </em>price hike here in December. In a "message for our members," the streaming service states that it will increase its monthly cost to $82.99 in light of "rising content costs."</p><p>The service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/9285852">published a support page</a> to explain the entire scope of this price hike.</p><p>According to YouTube TV, this updated $82.99 price will affect those purchasing the Basic Plan. The change has occurred today (Dec 12) for all new members. However, "most" existing users will see this change go into effect for their accounts on January 13, 2025. In short, this is a $10 hike from the Basic Plan's former $72.99 charge.</p><p>Another detail to know is that anyone whose membership is paused will see this new price once you've reactivated it. Additionally, if you've received YouTube TV's Basic Plan via a promotional trial or price, the post states this new price will be attached once the promotion expires. Those who've purchased the Basic Plan through a YouTube TV Integrated Billing partner will see this new price applied to their account on February 13, 2025.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A message for our members: we have always worked to offer the content you love, with features to enjoy the best of live TV. To keep up with rising content costs, we’re updating our monthly price to $82.99/mo. (1/3)<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1867236661173612567">December 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>YouTube TV adds that it didn't make this decision "lightly" and states that it may "impact" its users. While the price is set to rise in a month, the post adds that those sticking with the Basic Plan won't lose any content. The Basic Plan will continue to feature 100 plus channels, unlimited storage DVR, six accounts per household, and more.</p><p>What's strange about this announcement is that YouTube TV denied any sort of price increase on Monday (Dec 9), as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://michaelsaves.com/streaming/youtube-tv-raising-prices/">Michael Saves</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/youtube-tv-denies-price-hike-blames-verizon-ad-error/">Cord Cutters News</a>). Verizon had run an ad (albeit a little early) about a discounted YouTube TV price within its new bundle. The post states the listed price for the service was this $82.99 tag instead of the (now old) $72.99 price.</p><p>The publication spotted TeamYouTube on X denying the idea of a price hike earlier this week. However, the social media post has since been deleted.</p><p>YouTube TV states users can check their membership status by heading into their <strong>Settings > Membership</strong>.</p><p>The streaming service has a lengthy history of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tvs-price-increasing-65-month">continuously raising prices</a>. In 2021, the platform's monthly cost rose by $15 to $64.99 per month. Then, in March 2023,  YouTube TV took prices up <em>again</em>, which saw the final price <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-2023-price-increase">double what it started as originally</a>. Prices rose by $8 to $72.99 — and now we're met with a $10 jump today.</p><p>Its words today echo what was said last year, as YouTube TV stated the price hike was because "content costs have risen." It added that the rise in fees can help its team ensure "quality of service."</p>

It's simply a fact of life, but there's a difference between necessary and expected price increases — like inflation — and corporate price hikes. Over the past decade, it has become harder and harder to tell the difference between the two in the smartphone industry. Sale prices for phones across all price points are rising. It's an unfortunate trend for our wallets that, by all indications, won't get any better when Samsung officially unveils its upcoming Galaxy S25 series next year.</p><p>For context, Samsung might be one of the worst offenders when it comes to outrageous smartphone pricing. The current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is the most expensive non-foldable flagship Android phone on the market in the U.S. today, with a retail price of $1,299. The prior <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> was cheaper, but Samsung axed the cheaper model with reduced RAM this year, and thus the cost is higher.</p><p>It did something similar with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, raising the price of each by $100 despite minimal improvements. In other words, Samsung is no stranger to price hikes. On top of that, the already-high price of the Galaxy S24 Ultra leaves the brand little wiggle room. How much more expensive can this phone get?</p>

<p>From the beginning, rumors indicated that Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset was more expensive than its predecessors. By nature, that would send shockwaves through the industry. OEMs could either eat the cost or pass the higher fee onto consumers — and I think we all know which option corporations are likely to choose.</p><p>In September, a reliable leaker claimed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-rumored-price-hike-sour">the price of a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> increased by about 20% compared to the prior generation, reaching about $190 — just for the system-on-a-chip. More recently, things have been quiet about Snapdragon 8 Elite and Galaxy S25 pricing. That is until this week when a Korean outlet reported on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-alleged-sporadic-price-increase-rumored">the possibility of a price increase for the Galaxy S25 series in some markets</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.yna.co.kr/amp/view/AKR20241209139300017" target="_blank">Yonhap News</a> (Korean) believes that the higher cost of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, paired with unfavorable exchange rates, could lead to a price hike in South Korea — and possibly other markets. However, a separate report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,147437.html" target="_blank">WinFuture</a> (German) notes that price increases might not affect every region.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the official prices of Snapdragon 8 Elite chipsets aren't public, they appear to be a driving factor behind talk about higher prices during this release cycle. The experts agree: according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/smartphone-asp-rising-on-soc-memory-price-increases" target="_blank">Counterpoint Research</a>, the rising global average sale price (ASP) of smartphones is linked to higher costs for processors and memory. Early Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered phones, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a>, have been priced higher as a result.</p><p>Counterpoint Research associates the push for 3nm and 4nm process nodes with the price increases for silicon across the market. Qualcomm is using the 3nm fabrication process for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> and, crucially, its custom Oryon core design. It's the same in-house design that helped the Snapdragon X laptop chip become a fan favorite.</p><p>Interestingly, the Snapdragon X Plus chip helped midrange laptops become more powerful and at approachable price points. Meanwhile, the Snapdragon 8 Elite looks to be a big upgrade over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, but it is doing the opposite for affordability. It's fair to wonder if the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is really worth it if it drives the prices of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series even higher.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="aW5aJXDvAiQnLpfxNZ3NE3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-yellow-grey-s-pen-03.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aW5aJXDvAiQnLpfxNZ3NE3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not just the flagship phones getting more expensive, either. The SoC and memory costs are driving the global average sale price up <em>overall</em>. The global ASP is projected to rise 3% this year and 5% next year, according to counterpoint. You might be surprised to learn that even with 2024's projected 3% price increase, the global ASP for smartphones is just $365.</p><p>You're not entirely wrong for expecting that figure to be much higher. That's because the ultra-premium sector of the smartphone market, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, is growing rapidly. And more Android phones are joining that category as price hikes continue to happen throughout the industry.</p><p>Counterpoint Research reports that sales of smartphones costing over $1,000 or more increased 18% year-over-year in the first half of 2024. Companies like Samsung continue to raise prices, and shockingly, we keep paying them. Will that change with the Galaxy S25 series?</p>
<h2 id="we-shouldn-t-pay-more-for-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-series-2">We shouldn't pay more for the Samsung Galaxy S25 series </h2>
<p>Based on the latest leaks and rumors, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series will bring quite a few improvements. The Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is as good as advertised, and at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-fcc-listing-details-confirmed">some Galaxy S25 models are projected to get a larger screen</a>. However, many other things will likely be unchanged from the Galaxy S24 series, like the overall design and the camera hardware on certain models.</p><p>Put another way, the Galaxy S25 might be a great phone. It just probably won't be worth more than the Galaxy S24, which was already priced fairly high. The only way we, as consumers, can tell Samsung this is by resisting the temptation to upgrade to the latest generation of Galaxy. If the Galaxy S25 comes at a higher price yet again, I can say with absolute certainty I won't be buying it.</p>

<h2 id="everything-else-you-need-to-know-about-battery-life-and-charging-on-the-pixel-watch-3-2">Everything else you need to know about battery life and charging on the Pixel Watch 3</h2>
<p>Battery life on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> depends on a variety of factors, from usage habits to the number of GPS workouts tracked on a daily basis. Regardless of how you use the Pixel Watch 3, you should get at least a full day of usage on a single charge. Google's official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/13579780" target="_blank">support document</a> explains that the Pixel Watch 3's battery life will last up to 24 hours on a single charge with the always-on display turned on. The company tested battery life based on the median Pixel Watch user's usage habits, and with a mixture of talk, data, standby, and use of other features.</p><p>To get the most battery life out of your Pixel Watch 3, you'll want to enable Battery Saver. This setting will disable the always-on display and a few other features, but will keep tilt-to-wake active. In exchange, the Pixel Watch 3 will last up to 36 hours on a single charge. To turn on Battery Saver, tap the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Pixel Watch 3, press <strong>Battery</strong>, and flip the <strong>Battery Saver</strong> toggle.</p><p>In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review#section-google-pixel-watch-3-battery-charging" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 3 review</a>, Android Central's resident wearable expert Michael Hicks consistently got up to 48 hours with fairly intensive use, including the always-on display and at least one activity tracked.</p>

<p>Other testers at Android Central had less stellar battery life experience, but still found the Pixel Watch 3 to last longer than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>. This could be partially related to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces">Wear OS 5's efficiency improvements</a>.</p><p>Charging speed will vary slightly between the Pixel Watch 3 (41mm) and the Pixel Watch 3 (45mm). The former has a 307mAh battery, while the latter has a 420mAh battery. It'll take the smaller Pixel Watch 3 about an hour to reach 100%, while the larger model takes 80 minutes to reach full capacity.</p><p>Battery life and charging was a significant downside of early Pixel Watch generations, and while it still isn't outstanding, the Pixel Watch 3 will last a full day on a single charge — even with heavy use — and charges relatively quickly.</p>

<p>While some Moto AI features are widely available across <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a>, the select capabilities part of the Moto AI suite are only available on select devices. As of November 2024, the suite is available for beta testing on the following smartphones:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Motorola Edge 50 Ultra</strong></li><li><strong>Motorola Razr Plus 2024</strong>/<strong>Razr 50 Ultra</strong></li><li><strong>Motorola Razr 2024</strong>/<strong>Razr 50</strong></li></ul>
<p>Motorola has not said if it will expand the availability of these features to more devices, although we can likely expect them on future models.</p><p>While the beta program is available globally, Moto AI features are only available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.</p>

<p>Similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, Moto AI is the backbone of a number of features found on Motorola phones. Some of these features are already available on some devices in an official capacity, including the following:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Magic Canvas</strong>: Lets users create images using a text-to-image generator that can be used as wallpapers.</li><li><strong>Style Sync</strong>: Generates a pattern that matches the color and style of images you take or upload.</li></ul>
<p>Moto AI also encompasses features used to enhance image capture on select devices. It powers the Photo Enhancement Engine on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, which improves photos by preserving RAW image data when enhancing an image after it's taken. It also improves stabilization and optimizes shutter speed for features like Action Shot, which allows users to take photos of fast-moving subjects with greater clarity.</p><p><u><strong>Moto AI beta features</strong></u></p>
<ul><li><strong>Catch Me Up</strong>: Moto AI will summarize missed calls and messages from <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging apps</a> like Google Messages, WhatsApp, Telegram, and more so that you can quickly understand the gist of what's happening in conversations you may have missed.</li><li><strong>Remember This</strong>: Save screenshots, notes, and images to your Journal with AI-generated summaries and object recognition technology so that you can recall them later.</li><li><strong>Pay Attention</strong>: Records conversations, then transcribes and summarizes them.</li></ul>

<p>In addition to the Moto AI features currently available, Motorola has also shown off its concept for what it's calling a "Large Action Model" or LAM. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">demonstrated at Lenovo Tech World 2024</a>, the LAM learns a user's behavior and preferences so that it can perform actions with very little input from the user.</p><p>For example, when prompted to order a coffee, the LAM will automatically locate a nearby coffee shop and go through the motions of ordering your preferred drink. The only input from the user will be to confirm the order. You can also prompt the LAM by telling it where you want to go, and it will order an Uber.</p>

<p>For now, the LAM is just a proof of concept, and Motorola has not disclosed if or when it will launch on devices. Like the new suite of Moto AI features, we can probably expect this to land in beta before becoming more widely available.</p>

<ul><li>Google and Samsung partnered to create a new version of Android, called Android XR, that will power a new generation of extended-reality wearables.</li><li>Android XR is launching today as a developer preview, and the first hardware products powered by the new OS are set to launch in 2025.</li><li>Samsung will make the first headset powered by Android XR, condemned Project Moohan, next year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Three years ago, Google and Samsung teamed up to build a new software platform for wearables: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS</a>. Now, the developer of Android and the largest Android manufacturer are joining forces once again to build a new operating system from the ground up. It's called Android XR, and with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> at the core, Google and Samsung think it'll be the foundation for the next generation of extended-reality wearables.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-xr" target="_blank">Android XR</a> is available starting today, Dec. 12, as a developer preview. While the first hardware product running Android XR won't be available to consumers until next year, developers are getting an early look at the latest version of Android. The Android XR developer preview supports dev tools like ARCore, Android Studio, Jetpack Compose, Unity, and OpenXR. Additionally, since the Android XR SDK is built on the foundation of Android, most apps on the Google Play Store will be automatically available on Android XR.</p><p>Android Studio and the Android XR Emulator will give developers a head start on building for the upcoming platform. Google and Samsung, entering the XR market relatively late, likely want to avoid the struggles Apple faced when it launched visionOS earlier this year. It only had 600 native apps available when visionOS debuted. The Android XR developer preview could help the companies avoid growing pains, but wanting developers to build for an unknown platform with many hardware unknowns could prove to be a tall ask.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.73%;"><img id="GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Side-render" alt="An official product render of Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5120" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The operating system will first debut on mixed-reality headset, and Samsung will be the first manufacturer to ship an Android XR device. It's codenamed Project Moohan, and bears a striking resemblance to another expensive headset. Android XR headsets, like Project Moohan, will provide both immersive experiences and extended-reality experiences. For example, you might watch a movie completely immersed, and later use an Android XR headset to interact with your real-world environment with Gemini.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="DRPgjWYXCq5R2PqDAfeiqD" name="Glasses_Translate-google-android-xr" alt="Translating a sign using smart glasses powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DRPgjWYXCq5R2PqDAfeiqD.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Eventually, the multimodal interaction provided by Gemini in Android XR will be available in a glasses form factor. Google says it wants glasses to be available for "all-day help," and crucially, hopes to build an ecosystem of "stylish, comfortable glasses you'll love to wear every day and that work seamlessly with your other Android devices."</p><p>Google has a pair of prototype glasses in the works, and some people outside the company will soon get the privilege of trying them out. The company announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Gemini 2.0</a> a day prior, and with it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">the Project Astra trusted tester program</a>. There's a Google Form for users to sign up for a waitlist, and as part of the form, Google asks if you're interested in "using prototype glasses."</p><p>If these prototype smart glasses are anything like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>, they could be far out from a public release. Additionally, they might not be released at all — part of the Android XR platform is building up an ecosystem of hardware products with partners like Samsung, Qualcomm, Lynx, Sony, and XREAL. Google might not end up being the one to release a headset or glasses, but it'll certainly be the steward of Android XR.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="H6v9tA3m9Tq5TSncqyvWiG" name="android-xr-smart-glasses-concept-01" alt="A lifestyle image showing off a prototype pair of smart glasses powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H6v9tA3m9Tq5TSncqyvWiG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For now, Android XR is just a preview of what the next Android platform might become. If Google and Samsung succeed, Android XR could become a vibrant ecosystem like Wear OS and Android Auto before it. We'll learn more about Android XR hardware in 2025, and you can learn more about the OS for yourself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android.com/xr" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Enter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Android XR</a>, the first new version of Android made for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> era. Google says it's built with Gemini at the core, enabling a brand new type of user interface that's driven entirely by the way you interact with Google's multimodal AI.</p><p>As you might have guessed, the XR in Android XR isn't some weird Roman numeral moniker. Rather, it stands for e<strong>X</strong>tended <strong>R</strong>eality and is a new spinoff of Android built to unify XR products — mainly smart glasses and VR headsets — under a new set of standards and tools. It's exactly how Android Auto is built for car infotainment systems, and Wear OS is built for smartwatches.</p><p>It's a huge opportunity for Google to take the reigns and bring technologies together that, so far, are all very different and often feature messy experiences. But is it too little too late for Google to be doing this? The company thinks otherwise, and Gemini is here to prove it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF" name="android-xr-video-player-ui" alt="A look at the video player UI of Android XR running on a Samsung Project Moohan headset in mixed reality" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The field of XR is still exciting despite having popular consumer products on the market for a solid decade. Many of the existing UI design paradigms don't feel great in VR — using your laser pointer to select things just feels lazy — but UX designers have made significant headway on this portion of the experience in the last few years with things like hand tracking and eye tracking.</p><p>However, Google says a third method is required for truly natural and seamless interaction between the real and virtual worlds: an AI assistant. This is no secret since a multimodal AI assistant is exactly what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">makes Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses so special</a>.</p><p>Meta even launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-news-recap-july-26-2024">Meta AI assistant on Meta Quest headsets</a> this summer, but Google aims to take this concept even further than Meta has, utilizing full hand tracking, eye tracking, and the voice assistant to make the UI feel as natural as possible.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google is unlocking the full power of Gemini by giving it the ability to see and hear the world around it, delivering context to you in a potential smart glasses form factor.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>In one example, Google showed us a prototype pair of AR glasses that have a small screen in the lens, not too dissimilar to what the company launched with Google Glass in 2014. The big difference is that, with Gemini built in, the person wearing the glasses was able to have a conversation with the AI that helped them navigate a busy street without staring at their phone.</p><p>Gemini's full capabilities become unlocked with a product like this because it can see through the cameras on the glasses, hear your voice, and interact with you as if it were a human instead of a bunch of icons on a display. It takes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps-can-now-determine-your-precise-location-using-live-view-ar">existing AR features of Google Maps</a> and makes them make sense.</p><p>Holding up your phone and looking "through" its screen is fine enough, I suppose, but it also invites criminals to snatch your phone and is generally just kind of awkward. Whether it works as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta's Orion prototype</a> is anyone's best guess, but they sure do look nice.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Talking to Gemini in Android XR is more like talking to a person rather than a digital assistant because the answers aren't generic.

<p>It's an upgrade over what's currently provided on Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses because a screen is involved, allowing Gemini and Android XR to overlay virtual elements onto the real world.</p><p>On the VR side of the house, Android XR will enable more natural interactions with the virtual world as well as the real one, as seen in the previous example. This second example showed a person wearing a prototype Samsung VR headset (called Project Moohan) while watching YouTube.</p><p>Project Moohan is equipped with a Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 — that's a step up from the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 in the Quest 3 and 3S — and is set to debut in 2025 "with more devices to follow," per Qualcomm. It also looks incredibly sleek, giving off vibes from the über-expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-launch-sales-success">Apple Vision Pro</a> rather than Meta's more affordable Quest series.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.73%;"><img id="GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Side-render" alt="An official product render of Samsung's Project Moohan VR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvSEctRTR7cSxxZmNyABX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5120" height="2700" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The headset itself isn't the notable thing in this example, although it is Samsung's first VR headset since its HMD Odyssey headset in 2017. Rather, the way this person was interacting with the content onscreen was game-changing. Gemini is able to see and understand what's happening onscreen, meaning you can ask it <em>anything</em> and get a context-sensitive response.</p><p>Again, this is more like talking to a person rather than a digital assistant because the answers aren't generic. They're extremely specific to what you're doing and what you need at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="but-what-about-google-2">But what about Google?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ynuoir6wBUdePdHywfUwfG" name="android-xr-smart-glasses-concept-02" alt="A lifestyle image showing off a prototype pair of smart glasses powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ynuoir6wBUdePdHywfUwfG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In this case, Google has some very good and some very bad things going for it. Let's get the bad out of the way first: Google has a bad habit of starting cool projects only to drop them a year or two later. The list of projects that have ended up like this is endless, and the problem is that several major AR/VR projects are included in that list. Google Daydream and Google Glass are chief among them.</p><p>Google beat Meta to the punch with a standalone VR headset it made in partnership with Lenovo, only to stop supporting it shortly after launch. The company told us it's been at the heart of XR development all along — and that's certainly true with these developments, Google Cardboard, AR Core, etc. — but people have lost faith in Google side projects like this because of failures like Stadia and others.</p><p>Nothing in the company's presentation told me that this could potentially be any different. If it does well, Android XR will go on to become like Wear OS and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>, two extremely successful Android spinoff platforms that are used by millions of users every day. If it doesn't meet some internal goal within a year or two, who knows what'll happen, although we can all guess based on history.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="H6v9tA3m9Tq5TSncqyvWiG" name="android-xr-smart-glasses-concept-01" alt="A lifestyle image showing off a prototype pair of smart glasses powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H6v9tA3m9Tq5TSncqyvWiG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Meta has charged through despite the investment into XR costing billions, and it has at least partially paid off because the company is the king of the entire umbrella category. The Meta Quest is by far the best-selling family of VR products ever, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> have blown the lid off the smart glasses market to pave the way to successful form factors and adoption.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>If it does well, Android XR will go on to become like Wear OS and Android Auto, two extremely successful Android spinoff platforms that are used by millions of users everyday.

<p>But Meta isn't exactly loved by people, not just because of its Facebook lineage but because of its handling of developer relations over the years. Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/sherlocking-what-happens-when-big-tech-steals-your-ideas">has shamelessly Sherlocked</a> features from developers over the years — something Google, Apple, Microsoft, and basically every other big tech company is also guilty of — but it has also alienated developers who have nowhere else to turn to since Meta owns the VR market with an 80% market share.</p><p>Recent changes to the Meta Quest store have buried developers underneath a swath of cheap Gorilla Tag clones and promotion for Meta's own Horizon Worlds metaverse platform instead of propping up paid games that used to see more promotion on the digital storefront.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I've talked to many VR developers who are happy with the success they've seen from the Quest platform in the past but have been unhappy with how things have changed this year. It's these very people who can build apps for Google's new Android XR platform and potentially give it a win over Meta's Horizon OS .</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This is where Google can improve and even win developers over with a new way of doing business. I've talked to many VR developers who are happy with the success they've seen from the Quest platform in the past but have been unhappy with how things have changed this year. It's these very people who can build apps for Google's new Android XR platform and potentially give it a win over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-nervous-about-meta-horizon-os">Meta's Horizon OS</a>.</p><p>In fact, Google and Qualcomm have been working with the folks over at Unity to provide full Android XR support in Unity 6, making it easier for developers to port their existing (and upcoming) games to Android XR with fairly minimal effort.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j" name="Headset_GooglePhotos-project-moohan-android-xr" alt="Running Google Photos in mixed reality on Samsung Project Moohan, powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest issue is that this Android XR announcement doesn't come with any hardware commitments. Instead, today's announcement teases Samsung and Qualcomm hardware partnerships — Google likens this to rebuilding Wear OS with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a> — but without a specific price and date for a product, it's hard to feel like Google is in this to win it.</p><p>Qualcomm and Google say they're working with Lynx, Sony, and Xreal to deliver more products in 2025, though, so it's possible that something actually will come of this whole effort this time around.</p><p>I'd like to have faith that Google and Samsung could pull this off — the bones of Android XR are sounding <em>extremely </em>promising — but Google's history of abandoned projects makes me more worried than hopeful right now. Stadia was a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy and I'm just not sure I'm ready to go through another one of those again.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-107">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The lock screen widget carousel, which let users tap the clock to access full-sized widgets, is missing in the latest One UI 7 beta.</li><li>The lock screen now only supports mini widgets below the clock, but Good Lock’s LockStar module still allows full customization.</li><li>While Samsung pulls back, Google is going the other way, with Android 15 QPR1 and QPR2 keeping full-sized lock screen widgets, at least on tablets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While Samsung added more lock screen customization in the first One UI 7.0 beta, the company may have removed the widgets carousel, with no word on its return.</p><p>Samsung’s delayed Android 15-based One UI 7 beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">finally made its way to the Galaxy S24 series last week</a>, and it’s packing some solid updates. One of the big ones is the long-awaited vertical app drawer, replacing the old horizontal layout and making things feel much smoother and easier to navigate. On top of that, One UI 7 introduces the Now Bar to keep track of live activities, plus a revamped Quick Settings panel that's now separate from the notification shade.</p><p>Even with all the new upgrades, One UI 7 appears to be saying goodbye to the lock screen widget carousel. Users could tap the lock screen clock to access a carousel with full-sized widgets in previous versions. But with One UI 7, it looks like that feature is being dropped.</p><p>A Reddit user recently spotted, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-7-widget-carousel-3507162/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, that the lock screen widget carousel is missing from the latest One UI 7 beta. If this sticks around in the final release, Samsung’s One UI will align even more with Google’s Android, which stopped supporting native lock screen widgets back with Android 5.0.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:369px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.80%;"><img id="7KfEai4jciv5CzbFUVtPCg" name="Lock-screen-and-AOD-setting-One-UI-7" alt="Lock screen and AOD settings in One UI 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7KfEai4jciv5CzbFUVtPCg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="369" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In earlier versions of One UI, users could find the lock screen widget carousel settings under <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>Lock screen and AOD</strong> > <strong>Widgets</strong>, where they could choose full-sized widgets like Weather, Calendar, and Digital Wellbeing. But with the latest One UI 7 beta, this setting is nowhere to be found.</p><p>As a result, the lock screen only shows mini widgets below the clock. For those who enjoy customizing their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>, Good Lock's LockStar module still lets you add any widget to the lock screen.</p><p>While Samsung is pulling back on lock screen widgets with One UI 7, Google is heading in the opposite direction. Android 15 QPR1 brought full-sized lock screen widgets, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/android-15-brings-lock-screen-widgets-back-to-life-on-tablets">they’re sticking around in Android 15 QPR2 for tablets</a>.</p>

<p>Garmin watches are popular with fitness enthusiasts who have the patience to sift through its tricky UI, the Labyrinthian Connect app, and the weird IQ spinoff where Garmin hides its best third-party tools.</p><p>It's not especially accessible to people coming from Apple and Android watches with better smarts. While I review most of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>, my colleagues who've tested some models have complained about the high learning curve and unnecessary confusion.</p><p>Last month, I wrote about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-watches-could-learn-a-lot-from-garmin">every feature Wear OS should borrow from Garmin</a>, a long list from downloadable courses and better accessory support to battery life concerns, among other weak points. So, I think it's only fair to turn things around on Garmin: there are areas where it could learn from a brand like Wear OS, which is designed to cater to "mainstream" users and be as accessible as possible.</p><p>Garmin <em>can't</em> offer certain smarts because at least half of its users use iPhones, and Apple will keep blocking other watches from syncing properly until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/your-android-smartwatch-could-soon-work-much-better-on-iphone-thanks-to-the-eu">EU forces them</a> to open things up. In the meantime, with so many smartwatches adding fitness tools like training load to try and compete with Garmin, it makes sense for Garmin to turn the tables and compete more on smarts.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review" target="_blank">Garmin Fenix 8</a> added the brand's first offline voice assistant; you hold down a button, then say a command like "Open Spotify," "Start a Cycling workout," or "Show me my most recent workout," and have it take you where you need to go.</p><p>It's not perfect — it's a little slow, and Garmin needs to keep adding more recognized commands — but it's very useful. So it's a shame that very few Garmin watches have a mic, and the only (somewhat) affordable model (the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a>) only supports passthrough commands to your phone assistant.</p><p>If a $50 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-band-7-review">Amazfit Band 7</a> can afford to pack in a mic for Alexa commands, I think more Garmin watches can fit them in, not just the mainline Venus and Fenixes. And voice commands will help newer users find information before they're familiar with the UI. Google Assistant is a key reason people buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>, and Garmin needs to make its assistant as widespread.</p>
<h2 id="copy-wear-os-tiles-2">Copy Wear OS tiles</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cm3nSuJTMJFTvtgbnXPkoC" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-weather-tile" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 showing the Weather tile, with an hourly forecast for the evening." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cm3nSuJTMJFTvtgbnXPkoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Garmin finally made its UI a little smarter last year by making its apps easier to find and adding a list view that is accessible with the main Start button. It may not have a grid view like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, but I think that's more about aesthetics than functionality, and Garmin doesn't have as many apps to worry about.</p><p>What would help far more is copying Wear OS's tile view, letting you swipe left and right from Garmin's main watch face to see your favorite graphs or functions.</p><p>Rather than having to swipe down to the compact weather widget, select it, and then scroll down to find the hourly or daily forecast, it'd be nice to swipe right and have a full view of that data immediately. The same goes for flashlight controls or seeing your daily calendar with the suggested/scheduled workout — there are so many functions that require two or three taps every time that Garmin could make them more accessible for those who want to prioritize that data.</p><p>In my case, I find it a bit annoying that to see my acute load or load focus, I have to scroll down to the Training Status widget, then scroll down to the sub-widget and select it. Some graphs have watch face shortcuts, but you're limited if you buy an "S" model with a smaller display and less room for data. Other data like Challenges and monthly mileage require diving into the mobile app.</p><p>If, instead, Garmin took after Wear OS and let you highlight your favorite graphs and app views with a couple of swipes, that would also make things more accessible. Now that more models use AMOLED displays and touchscreens, it's time to take advantage of the extra pixels.</p>

<p>Plenty of Garmin fans have clamored for this for years. Aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Garmin Forerunner 945 LTE</a> — which only used cellular for basic safety check-ins — and the kid-focused <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-bounce-kids-watch-review-the-fun-smartwatch-for-kids">Garmin Bounce LTE</a>, Garmin never lets you pay extra for cellular, even as competing flagship watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> make it a default.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-used-to-want-lte-smartwatch-but-not-anymore">I personally don't care about LTE watches</a> because I'm too cheap to give my carrier more money and almost always have my phone on hand. But being unable to send check-ins, incident detection warnings, or manual SOS because your phone battery died is hard to accept for Garmin fans who'd willingly pay for that peace of mind...but don't want to bother with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-inreach-messenger-plus-announced">InReach Messenger Plus</a> and a hyper-expensive satellite subscription.</p><p>Fenix and Venu models with the mic/speaker combo should allow for standalone calls or the ability to record voice clips and add them to your next check-in for loved ones to hear.</p>

<p>Garmin's Firstbeat Analytics and Coaching algorithms make it the brand to beat for training guidance. It's also one of the best for overall data accuracy. Yet when it comes to general health advice or making its data accessible, it's easy to argue that Google and Samsung have recently gained the edge and even some smart rings.</p><p>Samsung only recently added its Energy Score (similar to Body Battery), but it also has new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> Wellness tips; the image above shows how it can track and display trends like changing resting heart rate or dipping body fat.</p><p>Fitbit has always been popular for summarizing your health information in accessible ways, as long as you pay for Premium. A more recent development is its Gemini-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-labs-insight-explorer-test-gemini-start">Fitbit Insight Explorer</a>: It's an opt-in service that analyzes your steps, Active Zone Minutes, sleep quality, HRV, RHR, and other data, then lets you ask its chatbot questions about your averages, trends, and personal bests.</p>

<p>Garmin has a <em>wealth</em> of information it could summarize in weekly or monthly reports, but its "In Focus" widgets show basic weekly trends for things like mileage and load without commentary, and all of its Health graphs are buried a few layers deep in the "More" tab where most people never look.</p><p>Instead, Garmin might highlight promising or negative health trends in its Morning Report; ideally, it could also provide monthly summaries of how your training load, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a>, and other fitness stats compare to past months. It could recommend changes like more anaerobic workouts or more steps.</p><p>To be honest, I'm not <em>thrilled</em> to imagine Garmin Coach progressing from this silent, data-driven platform to some public-facing chatbot like Amazfit's Zepp Coach. But for all the people who use ChatGPT as their default search engine and knowledge base, they'll find Wear OS watches more accessible because they're starting to go all-in on AI insights, and Garmin might need to find an AI partner to help them compete.</p>
<h2 id="above-all-else-accessibility-is-key-2">Above all else, accessibility is key</h2>
<p>I don't want Garmin to become a carbon copy of Wear OS. Core customers love its watches for their long battery life and wouldn't want to lose that for "smarts" that they don't need. But at the same time, I know plenty of people who <em>want</em> to like Garmin watches but can't get past how dense and complicated everything is.</p><p>If Garmin can use voice commands, pseudo-tiles, and off-device AI processing to help users find health and fitness information, it will have taken some of the best aspects of using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">best Wear OS watches</a> while still retaining its identity.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google released its next-generation set of artificial intelligence models, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Gemini 2.0</a>, today alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">glimpses of longer-term AI projects</a>. But even before the company's ambitious announcements, Google's leader expressed confidence in its AI developments. At the now-concluded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/events/dealbook/sessions/sundar-pichai-building-the-future" target="_blank">Dealbook Summit</a>, hosted by the New York Times, Google CEO Sundar Pichai had strong words for his company's competitors, and separately, those critical of AI's future (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/google-ceo-jab-at-microsoft-ai-efforts-side-by-side-comparison" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>).</p><p>Pichai, who has led Google through a challenging period that included massive layoffs and a shift toward AI, is still confident there is more progress to be made.</p><p>"When you start out quickly scaling up, you can throw more compute and you can make a lot of progress, but you definitely are going to need deeper breakthroughs as we go to the next stage," Pichai said at the Dealbook Summit. "So you can perceive it as there's a wall, or there's some small barriers."</p><p>The chief executive appears to be in agreement with other industry leaders, such as OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, that AI models aren't hitting a so-called wall. In other words, some skeptics believe that AI development will grind to a halt following significant advancements in 2023 and 2024.</p><p>"I don't subscribe to the wall notion," Pichai said.</p><p>However, that doesn't mean the top boss at Google doesn't expect there to be a slowdown as AI development progresses. "I think the progress is going to get harder when I look at '25," the Google CEO explained. "The low-hanging fruit is gone.

<ul><li>A discovery made by Mr. Mobile on YouTube highlighted an app called Launcher 10 that can turn an Android phone into a Windows Phone OS.</li><li>Users will have an "authentic taste" of what it used to be, outfitted with the boxy, rectangular tiles that the Windows Phone software featured.</li><li>Microsoft discontinued Windows Phone in 2017 and even ended service support for its Surface Duo 2 in October 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Remember the old Microsoft Windows Phone software? Well, another person does, too, and there's a program that can get it done.</p><p>As spotted by our friends at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/phones/windows-phone/watch-mrmobile-turn-a-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-into-a-windows-phone">Windows Central</a>, YouTuber <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/_p4RbXLW8aY?si=aLU9Z6On6A2B1BBk&t=160">MrMobile</a>, AKA Michael Fisher, discovered a way to turn an Android phone into a Windows Phone. MrMobile found an app on the Play Store called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nfwebdev.launcher10&hl=en_US&pli=1">Launcher 10</a>, which gives users a "very authentic taste" of what once was for Microsoft's smartphone. If you remember the aesthetic of this phone — and Windows 8 by extension — then you know what you're in for.</p><p>Launcher 10 brings back those boxy, square, rectangular icons or "tiles." The app, when selected to be put to use within your settings, turns everything into what the Windows Phone OS used to be.</p><p>Interestingly enough, most of the apps that you're likely to have on your device like Gmail, Spotify, Google Calendar, Photos, and more appear properly through Launcher 10. Some of the app icons on the tiles take on Android's "Themed Icon," which is just an outline of the logo within it filled in with color. Others, like Chrome, feature a colored background with a recognizable logo in the center.</p><p>Another aspect that is very Windows Phone is the notifications. MrMobile gave a brief glimpse at a notification, which retained that Windows flair.</p><p>If you're interested, you can watch MrMobiles' <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p4RbXLW8aY&t=160s&ab_channel=MrMobile%5BMichaelFisher%5D">full glimpse at Launcher 10</a>. Additionally, the video highlights the app's multitude of customization options to get the right theme. However, MrMobiles delivers a warning to those who will want to go that extra mile with Launcher 10.</p>

<p>For those looking for a bit of nostalgia, Launcher 10 might be the best gift of the season. Microsoft discontinued its Windows Phone OS in 2017. It didn't come without a heavy heart as the company's CEO Satya Nadella told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-interview-ai-activision-blizzard-axel-springer-2023-10?r=US&IR=T">Business Insider</a> in 2023 "the decision I think a lot of people talk about – and one of the most difficult decisions I made when I became CEO — was our exit of what I'll call the mobile phone as defined then" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-admits-giving-up-on-windows-phone-was-one-of-the-most-difficult-decisions-he-made">IGN</a>).</p><p>The Windows Phone OS was in response to what Apple had done with iOS and Google with Android, but it didn't catch on.</p><p>As such, Microsoft bowed out of the software side of mobile phones, but it still had its a phone: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/surface-duo-announcement">Surface Duo</a> and the Surface Duo 2 foldables. Neither of those devices lasted particularly long as Microsoft detailed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/microsoft-ends-surface-duo-2-support-with-final-security-update">end of service for the Surface Duo 2</a> this year in October. The device only received one update that took it from Android 11 to Android 12L.</p><p>It seemed that Microsoft was more interested in "streamlining" its Surface ecosystem and there are no plans to return the Duo.</p><p>Despite Microsoft's rocky smartphone and phone OS history, the company has taken strides to improve its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/phone-link-is-looking-more-like-windows-answer-to-apples-airdrop">computer relationship with Android phones</a>. In August, Windows' latest features for Phone Link for OS 10 and 11 rivaled Apple's AirDrop with quicker file sharing between PC and Android. Additionally, the dedicated app makes this even easier (and faster).</p><p>Elsewhere, Microsoft even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-6-1-1-app-mirroring-improved">improved its Link to Windows</a> mirroring experience for Galaxy devices with One UI 6.1.1 that same month.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is rumored to increase the price of the Galaxy S25 in South Korea following a higher exchange rate and chip costs from Qualcomm.</li><li>A concrete number wasn't stated; however, the price is expected to be "slightly" higher than the S24 in South Korea.</li><li>In contrast, another report states Samsung's Galaxy S25 series could have the same price in Europe.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors are surfacing, with details that suggest Samsung's next flagships could see a jump in price for some.</p><p>A recent report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.yna.co.kr/amp/view/AKR20241209139300017">Yonhap News</a> (Korean) cites an industry source in saying Samsung's Galaxy S25 series could see a price increase in South Korea (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/11/samsung-galaxy-s25-price-leaks/">9to5Google</a>). There is reportedly a "possibility" for such a future regarding the S25 trio. The publication purports that this apparent "outlook" is due to the use of Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> SoC in all three devices.</p><p>Its sources supposedly added that another contributing factor is the "predicted" price increase for the latest flagship chip. The company has reportedly raised the prices of its technology by roughly 30% when compared to previous generations and this is suspected to affect Samsung's views on the Galaxy S25 pricing.</p><p>The exchange rate between Samsung and Qualcomm is also another culprit for the potential price increase as it's higher than it has been in the past.</p><p>The publication didn't state an exact number; however, it's suspected to be "slightly" higher than the cost of the S24 on Samsung's home soil.</p><p>Elsewhere, another report spotted by 9to5 from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,147437.html">WinFuture</a> (German) claims that this price increase might not affect <em>every </em>region. The information comes via a retailer leak in the region, which shows that the Galaxy S25 pricing (seemingly) remains the same as the soon-to-be predecessor trio. The post claims that the prices were allegedly the same in Germany, which <em>could </em>mean that the rest of Europe will see the same prices.</p><p>According to the publication, the following leaked prices regard the base versions of the series: Galaxy S25 128GB: 899 euro (~$943), Galaxy S25 Plus 256GB: 1,149 euro (~$1,205), and the Galaxy S25 Ultra 256GB: 1,449 euro (~$1,520).</p><p>Of course, the U.S. pricing estimates here are not one-to-one, meaning these aren't something you should take as a literal. <em>If </em>Samsung raises prices in the U.S. market, these numbers will likely shift to better suit the area. Meanwhile, a potential price increase <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-rumored-price-hike-sour">was rumored in late September</a>.</p><p>Shortly before the Snapdragon 8 Elite launched, a tipster claimed that Qualcomm was placing a ~$190 price increase on its new Oryon CPU-based chip. That was roughly a 20% increase over the price of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for this latest generation of flagship models. The 3nm process was supposedly "quite expensive," thus the price increase rumors we've continued to hear.</p><p>The 8 Elite delivers powerful improvements over the SD 8 Gen 3, like a 45% boost in performance and a 44% boost in efficiency.</p><p>Samsung is expected to debut its Galaxy S25 series in January 2024 during Galaxy Unpacked. A recent string of rumors states the devices could even adopt <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-qi2-wireless-charging-support-rumors">Qi2 wireless charging</a>, too.</p>

<ul><li>Users reported issues accessing various Meta apps and platforms Wednesday, Dec. 11.</li><li>Meta acknowledged the "technical issue" in a post on X (formerly Twitter).</li><li>Though the company said it was working "as quickly as possible" to restore service, it did not provide a concrete timetable for a fix.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta apps, services, and platforms are currently experiencing a widespread outage, the company confirmed in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Meta/status/1866918000374280593" target="_blank">post</a> on X (formerly Twitter). Users started experiencing issues in the afternoon on Wednesday, Dec. 11, as evidenced by various social media posts on working platforms and by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com" target="_blank">Downdetector</a> — a site that tracks interruptions to major services. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram">Instagram</a>, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads, Messenger, and Oculus are a few platforms that appear to be affected by the outage.</p><p>"We’re aware that a technical issue is impacting some users’ ability to access our apps," the company said in the post. "We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience."</p><p>The problems can cause some Meta platforms to be inaccessible, load slowly, or show older posts. Multiple members of the Android Central team experienced issues with Meta apps. However, the number of Downdetector reports have slowly decreased over the last hour, indicating that Meta is making progress restoring service.</p><p>"We know there’s a technical issue impacting some people’s ability to access Instagram," the official Instagram account <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/instagram/status/1866920842443337824" target="_blank">posted</a> on X. "We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and are sorry for any inconvenience."</p>

<ul><li>Google announced that it has opened its "trusted testers" waitlist for interested participants for Project Astra, its AR venture.</li><li>The company detailed that users can engage with Project Astra via mobile (Android) and "prototype glasses."</li><li>It seems there will be an experimental Astra app that lets users open their camera or share their screen for quick information on what they see.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's "vision for the future of AR" is entering an exciting phase today (Dec 11) as it progresses its development.</p><p>Per Google's DeepMind page <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/project-astra/">for Project Astra</a>, the company announced that the latest AR venture has opened its "trusted tester" waitlist. The company states those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScCrFFCFcZ9q_0Ti_a-qkh56W26lysgcArpNiaDDQ8DngG9eg/viewform?utm_source=deepmind.google&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=gdm&utm_content=">signing up today</a> (Dec 11) can explore the "future capabilities" of its "universal AI assistant." Signing up will require users to fill out a brief form involving their name, location, age, and Android phone type.</p><p>Additionally, Google will ask if you are interested in "using prototype glasses."</p><p>When it comes to your phone, it seems this early test will see accepted participants downloading a Project Astra Android app. A short demo video shows that users can open the app and activate the camera within it to point at something they're interested in. Google states Astra is "multilingual," meaning users can speak to the AI model in their preferred language and receive information back.</p><p>The demo shows a model asking about a string of Chinese lanterns (in French). Astra responds both vocally and in written text with (hopefully) relevant and useful information about your query.</p><p>Moreover, Google adds that users can "share their screen" with Astra to gain even more assistance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1050px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.19%;"><img id="scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP" name="google-project-astra-enters-signup-phase" alt="Google's Project Astra lets testers point their cameras at items within its app to receive information about it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1050" height="527" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The AI model is said to leverage Google apps like Maps, Lens, and Search to fulfill a user's query. This is reportedly a part of its "enhanced understanding." A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/project-astra/tool-use/">subsequent post</a> shows that Astra is capable of "contextual understanding" for "clear, detailed answers, and it can explain the thinking and context behind" its answers. Moreover, Google has added a memory bank to Astra, meaning the AI <em>should </em>remember key details from your previous encounters.</p><p>This seems like something similar to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-saved-info-rollout-detailed">Saved Info</a>" in Gemini, which Google rolled out in mid-November.</p><p>The other side of this sign-up is Google's mention of prototype AR glasses. Its announcement splash page only highlights that Astra can "integrate seamlessly with prototype glasses to see the world as you see it – for an even more immersive and helpful experience."</p><p>We've been expecting AR glasses from Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">ever since I/O 2024</a> when it showcased Project Astra. The demo showed how interactive and engaged Project Astra is (likely) designed to be. When wearing a pair of AR glasses, the device will "record" your surroundings in real time, so when you ask a question, the AI can answer it.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that Project Astra is an AI routine <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">that's built off Gemini</a> to give it that "real person-like" experience during conversations. Google also showed that Astra can remember the location of objects, like where you last set down your AR glasses.</p>

<ul><li>Google is releasing Gemini 2.0 starting today, which will power what it calls the "agentic era."</li><li>Today, Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental is available to developers in the Google AI Studio and Vertex AI using the Gemini API.</li><li>Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental is also available in a chat-optimized form in the Gemini web client starting today, and the full lineup of Gemini 2.0 models will make their way to more Google products and services next year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Roughly 10 months after Google's current generation of AI models were released to the public, the company is previewing the future: Gemini 2.0. Starting today, the smaller Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model will be available to developers and Gemini users, with more sizes and implementations to come next year.</p><p>Google views the next step forward for AI as the "agentic era," and in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-ai-update-december-2024/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, the company outlined how Gemini 2.0 models are purpose-built to power AI agents. This will be the foundation for Google's most ambitious projects, from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">multimodal helpers</a> to Chrome extensions that can do your browsing for you.</p><p>"Over the last year, we have been investing in developing more agentic models, meaning they can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision," wrote Google CEO Sundar Pichai. "With new advances in multimodality — like native image and audio output — and native tool use, it will enable us to build new AI agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant."</p>

<p>Although only an experimental model of Google's smallest AI model is available today, there are a few key reasons to be excited. Notably, Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model not only outperforms Gemini 1.5 Flash, but also the larger and more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 1.5 Pro model</a> in certain benchmarks. Gemini 2.0 Flash now supports both multimodal inputs and outputs, meaning the model can natively generate images, text, speech, or a combination of the three.</p><p>Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental is available globally as an option in the Gemini web client today, and will come to the Gemini mobile app soon. Additionally, developers can try out the experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Flash using the Gemini API in Google AI Studio or Vertex AI.</p><p>Eventually, Gemini 2.0 will power most or all of Google's AI-equipped features. The models are specifically tailored for use with AI agents, like Project Astra, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">was previewed at Google I/O 2024</a>. It's a multimodal AI helper that can take in what's happening around you and answer questions with the context of your environment. There are also new projects, like Project Mariner. Currently, Project Mariner is a Chrome extension being tested as a research prototype that can handle your browsing needs for you.</p><p>Google's agentic vision is ambitious, with plenty more applications. There's Jules, a helper made for developers that integrates with GitHub workflows. Another proof-of-concept is the company's collaboration with Supercell, which tests how AI agents can be applied to strategy and simulation games.</p><p>Finally, there's now a new Deep Research mode in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-let-you-share-custom-gems-for-gemini-in-the-mobile-app">Gemini Advanced</a> that uses long context windows and advanced reasoning to function as a research assistant.</p><p>Many of Google's Gemini 2.0-powered ideas aren't available now, but are in active development. Project Astra, for example, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens">being tested externally through Google's trusted tester program</a>. However, some are available starting today, like Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental in Gemini and Gemini 2.0 in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-android-ai-overviews-spotted">AI Overviews</a> — which is in limited testing and will be more widely available next year.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-december-2024-feature-drop-announced">final Pixel update of the year</a> teased Emoji Kitchen changes for Gboard, and now we’re finally seeing them in action.</p><p>Gboard’s redesigned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-gboard-emoji-mashups-and-how-create-your-own">Emoji Kitchen</a> introduces a top-row suggestion bar in the Emoji tab, replacing the old recent creations list, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/12/09/gboard-emoji-kitchen-redesign/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. This handy tweak makes it super easy to explore fun emoji combos by just tapping a suggestion.</p><p>The update also makes Emoji Kitchen more accessible with a new arrow that opens an expanded "Browse" screen. Here, you’ll find tons of emoji pairings—including quirky ones as shown below. It’s a quicker, easier way to create stickers without scrolling endlessly.</p>

<p>This feature is perfect for anyone who values speed and wants to skip the trial-and-error hassle.</p><p>Furthermore, tapping on any emoji combo lets you break it down into the two originals. Plus, there’s a new history button in the top-right corner for quick access to your favorite or recent mashups. This redesign keeps the top suggestion bar clean and focused on fresh emoji ideas instead of past creations.</p><p>A new floating action button in the bottom-right corner gives quick access to the emoji picker. Pick an emoji, and you’ll see a full list of combo options using that emoji as the base. It makes creating unique emoji mashups way easier.</p><p>The changes might fly under the radar for casual users, but for Emoji Kitchen regulars, they make a big difference in how smoothly everything works.</p><p>The revamped Emoji Kitchen is rolling out as a server-side update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/top-gboard-tips-and-tricks">Gboard</a> beta users on version 14.8. It’s not available for stable users yet, but it’s expected to reach all Android phones, not just Pixels, eventually.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've always recommended Redmi Note devices in the past, and it was easy to do so; the devices combined great hardware with an unbeatable value, and they undercut their rivals by a considerable margin. But that hasn't been the case in the last two years, with Xiaomi changing focus to the mid-range category. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-12-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 12 Pro+</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro+</a> had gorgeous designs and decent hardware, they just didn't deliver on the value side of things, and the increase in price meant they didn't quite have the same mainstream likeability.</p><p>The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is much the same; it costs just as much as its predecessor, but you get better cameras and powerful hardware. The battery life is where you'll see the biggest difference, with the device featuring a massive 6200mAh battery that easily lasts two days between charges. <br><br>However, Xiaomi hasn't done enough on the software side of things. The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> out of the box, and that just isn't good enough on a mid-range phone at the end of 2024. What's even more annoying is that the device will get just three Android OS updates, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> — which it should have launched with — counts as one. <br><br>While the hardware is arguably better, the software situation continues to be a real problem for Xiaomi, and the brand doesn't seem to care about it — at least not enough to do change its strategy.</p>

<p>Xiaomi unveiled the Redmi Note 14 series in Q3 2024, and the phones made their global debut in India on December 9. The Redmi Note 14 and 14 Pro are the affordable models in the series, with the Note 14 Pro+ delivering the best hardware and cameras. <br><br>The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ starts at ₹30,999 ($365) in India for the variant with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and the 8GB/256GB model costs ₹32,999 ($390). There's also a 12GB/512GB edition that's available for ₹35,999 ($425), and all three variants are available in all three color options — blue, black, and purple — so that's good to see. <br><br>Xiaomi accelerated the launch timeline in India, with the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ debuting a month earlier than its predecessor. There's no telling when the phone will be available in the U.K. and other global markets, but if I had to venture a guess, it'd be sometime in January.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-note-14-pro-design"><span>Redmi Note 14 Pro+: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GWBwWcxVAhYVdRH5HNkMuS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GWBwWcxVAhYVdRH5HNkMuS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's clear that design is a key area of focus for Xiaomi, and the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is one of the best-looking devices in this category. In fact, I actually like this design more than that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a>; the smooth curves makes the device look elegant, and you don't feel like you're using a mid-range phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XrKnPRVckGiWbZcmNEB9yS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus back leather view with Redmi logo highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XrKnPRVckGiWbZcmNEB9yS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The color I'm using is particularly great, as it has a vegan leather back — the other two models have a regular glass back instead. The leather finish feels great, and there's a stitched pattern that gives the phone a little extra character. There's a new camera island at the back as well, and like the rest of the design, it looks clean and elegant. This area is often an afterthought on most Xiaomi devices, so it's good to see the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ getting a module that accentuates the design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rY55FCy8xCQe4Je98J2wyS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus camera housing at the back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rY55FCy8xCQe4Je98J2wyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi did the right things with material choices as well, with the device featuring an aluminum mid-frame that gives it additional rigidity. The sides have a glossy coat, and while you get symmetric curves, there's still enough width at the sides to hold the device. The sides are color-matched to the back, and again, it makes the device that a bit more upmarket.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AR3zHgcgirq3jwMuPqRemS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus side view with power button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AR3zHgcgirq3jwMuPqRemS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power and volume buttons have good tactility, and I didn't see any problems in this area. The only issue I have is that the in-screen module sits a little lower on the screen, making it awkward to access one-handed; this is true of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and several other devices I tested recently, so Xiaomi isn't the only brand doing this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cMaJHGRJdGLWJxdpoe6NpS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus IR blaster" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cMaJHGRJdGLWJxdpoe6NpS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is 6g heavier than its predecessor, you get a significantly bigger 6200mAh battery. Honestly, I didn't notice the added heft, and Xiaomi did a good job with the weight distribution. The in-hand feel is similarly great, and the phone isn't bulky or unwieldy in the least. <br><br>The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ retains IP68 ingress protection as well, giving it added resilience against dust and water. Overall, Xiaomi did all the right things with the design of the Redmi Note 14 Pro+, and it doesn't end up looking like a mid-ranger.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Q7vzzZtgNeRiG9qbTkbkwS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus home page with colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q7vzzZtgNeRiG9qbTkbkwS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ uses the same 6.67-inch panel size as last year, but it gets much brighter, and it gets Gorilla Glass Victus 2 as standard. You get the usual 120Hz refresh and a resolution of 2712 x 1220, but Xiaomi uses the dynamic mode out of the box, so you'll need to go into the settings to enable 120Hz.</p>
<p>Xiaomi usually does a good job with color calibration, but my unit had cooler colors out of the box; thankfully, it's easy to adjust color balance via the settings. Other than that, I didn't notice any issues with the panel as such — it has good contrast and vibrancy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pBeHtMTm5H6HUgTZ3fjFtS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus selfie camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pBeHtMTm5H6HUgTZ3fjFtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no problems using the panel outdoors; it gets sufficiently bright, and there's a slight difference from the Note 13 Pro+ in this regard. That said, the ambient brightness sensor is a little slow to adjust brightness, and I found myself having to use the brightness slider to manually adjust it several times.</p>

<p>While it won't win any awards, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ holds up well during gaming, but you will notice jitter in demanding titles. Video streaming is good enough; there's HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, but switching to HDR content in YouTube made the video jittery at times. Outside of that, colors looked great, and there wasn't any excessive blooming. <br><br>Like previous years, you get stereo sound, and it's detailed enough that you can use the onboard audio if you're listening to a podcast. There's 1920Hz PWM dimming, and you get a decent amount of configurability when it comes to always-on styles.</p>

<p>After using MediaTek-powered designs for the last three years, Xiaomi is back to using Qualcomm in the Redmi Note 14 Pro+. The phone is powered by the latest Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 platform, and it has a higher-clocked Adreno 710 and is manufactured on the 4nm node. <br><br>Given that Qualcomm was slow to switch to the latest Arm cores in the past, it's good to see the use of Cortex A720 and A520 cores this time. I noticed some lag at times — particularly when switching between a video and a game — but outside of that, there weren't any issues in regular use.</p>

<p>The phone does a good job with gaming as well, but it tends to be aggressive with thermal management, so you will see throttling in extended gaming sessions. There isn't much in the way of overheating, but you will see the occasional lag and jitter in demanding games; turning down the settings makes a difference. <br><br>Xiaomi is selling the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ in 8GB/128GB, 8GB/256GB, and 12GB/512GB configurations, and annoyingly, all storage modules of the device come with UFS 3.1 and not UFS 4.0. You miss out on Wi-Fi 6E as well, but there is Bluetooth 5.4 and NFC. I didn't see any issues with connectivity or calling, and I got a reliable cellular signal. <br><br>There's a new x-axis vibration motor, and while it doesn't deliver the same level of granular feedback as the Xiaomi 14, it is decent enough in its own right — considering how much you're paying for the phone.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ysd3QpE3YGmKqTaovSh3qS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus battery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ysd3QpE3YGmKqTaovSh3qS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the best features of the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is the significantly bigger 6200mAh battery. What's particularly great is that Xiaomi slotted in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon battery</a>, so you get much better density, and the phone can withstand extreme cold without any issues. It's great to see brands bringing this tech to the mid-range segment. <br><br>The increased battery size gives the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ a distinct advantage, and the phone manages to last two days without any issues. Even with heavy use, I only had to charge the device every other day, so if you need a phone with the best battery life in this segment, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is the one to get. <br><br>You also get 90W charging, and Xiaomi bundles the requisite charger in the box. It takes just over 65 minutes to fully charge the device, and that's not bad considering the size of the battery. Xiaomi has the usual battery safeguards to extend longevity, including charging limit and optimized charging.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmi-note-14-pro-cameras"><span>Redmi Note 14 Pro+: Cameras</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="i6Xd3FCCTzfFfgaNBWRtuS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus camera housing at the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i6Xd3FCCTzfFfgaNBWRtuS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After using 200MP cameras, Xiaomi is once again back to a 50MP main camera on the Redmi Note 14 Pro+, and the device features OmniVision's OVX8000 module, dubbed the Light Hunter 800 by Xiaomi. This is the same sensor that's used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-poco-f6-pro-is-the-most-underrated-phone-of-2024">POCO F6 Pro</a>, Xiaomi 14 Civi, and even the Xiaomi Mix Flip, so the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is in good company in this regard. <br><br>In a similar vein, Xiaomi added a 50MP Samsung JN1 telephoto lens at the back with 2.5x optical zoom, and this makes the phone much more versatile. After years and years of ineffectual auxiliary cameras, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ gets usable auxiliary cameras, and the 8MP wide-angle lens is decent enough in its own right. <br><br>However, Xiaomi is yet to address long-standing issues with video recording on the Redmi Note series; the phone still doesn't get 4K60 video, and what's even more annoying is that it doesn't even have 60fps at 1080p when using the wide-angle lens. The camera interface itself is unchanged in four years, so if you've used a Xiaomi or POCO phone in the past, you'll be familiar with all the settings.</p>

<p>Thanks to the new sensor, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ takes fantastic photos in any situation. Daylight shots have great detail and dynamic range, and accurate colors. You don't get overly saturated images, and foliage rendition is detailed without any aggressive smoothing. The camera does a fantastic job in low-light situations as well, providing good color vibrancy and plenty of detail, and no visible noise levels. It takes a smidgen longer to focus in low-light than high-end phones, but that's about the only shortcoming I noticed. <br><br>The telephotos lens is a good addition at the back, and it produces usable shots at up to 5x zoom. There's no OIS, and it may take a few tries to get the ideal shot, but again, the inclusion of a dedicated zoom lens is a big differentiator. The camera isn't quite as good in low-light, but you still get shots that are decent enough for sharing on social media. You get decent portraits as well, and while you can't adjust the focal length, there's a marked difference over the 13 Pro+. <br><br>The wide-angle lens is better than previous years, and while it doesn't measure up to the likes of the Xiaomi 14, it definitely holds its own against other mid-rangers. To sum up, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ has a versatile camera system that takes great images in most conditions, and it is right up there with the best in this category.</p>

<p>The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ comes with Android 14 out of the box, even though Google rolled out the stable version of Android nearly two months prior to the launch of the phone. Xiaomi's software interface needs an overhaul; the design is four years old at this point, and it's starting to show its age. <br><br>The UI has better fluidity than MIUI skins of yesteryear, and you get a decent amount of customizability. That said, ColorOS and Funtouch OS have better features in this area, and they're optimized much better. You also get plenty of bloatware, and while most of it can be uninstalled, it's annoying that Xiaomi hasn't addressed this yet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5scT4zZpiEnAF6mNTCyUxS" name="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus" alt="Redmi Note 14 Pro Plus notification shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5scT4zZpiEnAF6mNTCyUxS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of delivering the latest Android version, Xiaomi focused its attention on AI-assisted utilities, and like every other phone today, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ has a suite of AI tools with questionable usability. Circle to Search and AI-backed transcribing of audio recordings are useful, but I didn't see the utility of AI summaries and translate features baked into the Notes client. <br><br>Gallery has an AI-assisted object eraser, a tool that increases the size of the frame, and one that generates short video highlights from your photos. There's an AI translator and AI subtitles as well, and the main problem is that none of these are available out of the box — they'll be rolling out via software updates down the line. Given Xiaomi's track record at delivering timely updates, I wouldn't hold my breath. <br><br>Then there's the issue with system updates. Xiaomi is guaranteeing three Android OS updates and four years of security updates, but the problem is that Android 15 counts towards one of those updates, and that's just an underhanded move. Xiaomi does this intentionally so it doesn't have to bother with long-term updates down the line, and this practice alone makes me not want to recommend the device.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO F6</a> is my go-to recommendation in this segment, with the device offering a terrific combination of hardware and battery life. The camera isn't as good as the Redmi Note 14 Pro+, but it comes close, and it does a much better job at gaming. The battery lasts a day and a half, and coming in at ₹29,999 ($353), you get a much better value. <br><br>Obviously, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> continues to be a terrific choice, and while it is costlier at ₹35,999 ($425), you get a better phone in just about every area. The AMOLED panel gets brighter, the phone is significantly faster in regular use, and the main camera takes better photos in just about any scenario. <br><br>Nothing's Phone 2a Plus is also an intriguing choice to consider. It has a distinctive design, great software features, and two usable cameras at the back. And starting at ₹26,999 ($318), you're not paying a hefty premium.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a good-looking mid-range phone</li><li>You want great cameras at the back</li><li>You need the best battery life in this category</li></ul>

<p>I tested every Redmi Note phone released in the last decade, so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to these devices. While the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is costlier than earlier phones that came in the series, there isn't a price hike this year, and that's a good thing. <br><br>The hardware is really rather good, and the cameras are great — the inclusion of a telephoto lens gives it a decent edge, and that's no small feat in this category. The battery life is easily the best I've used on any mid-ranger, and it doesn't take long to charge the battery either. <br><br>But like the last two years, it's the software that ultimately limits the device. If you don't have an issue with the fact that the phone comes with Android 14 out of the box, then yes, the Redmi Note Pro 14+ is a decent choice. But the software makes a bigger difference in how long you can actually the phone, and in this area, Xiaomi is once again found to be lacking.</p>

                    <p><p>The Redmi Note 14 Pro+ combines terrific cameras with a massive battery, and the phone clearly nails the basics. However, the software is middling at best, and it detracts from what is an otherwise great device. If you don't mind that and need great cameras and two-day battery, the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ is a good overall choice. </p></p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking for holiday deals on Android devices, you&apos;ve come to the right place: a bunch of our favorite tech from Samsung, Google, OnePlus, and beyond is currently being discounted across the web, and I&apos;ve collected the best Android Central-approved options into this guide. </p><p>It was an interesting year for Android! AI took center stage, Android 15 dropped, and it felt like just about every OEM under the sun decided to release its own foldable phone. The OnePlus 12 even overtook Samsung and Google as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">our favorite Android phone</a> of the year! Now that we&apos;re nearing the new year, retailers are ditching their old stock to make room for the next generation, so it&apos;s a great time to shop for deals. </p><p>The holiday deals on display include discounts like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>$500 off the Google Pixel 9 at Mint Mobile</strong></a> when you add an eligible line, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0D84MHZX5/"><strong>this offer that drops a whopping 15% off the brand new Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus</strong></a>. Most of these deals should arrive by Christmas if you place your order today, but I&apos;ll make a note if I think that&apos;s going to be a concern. Either way, we&apos;re getting down to the wire, so act fast if something catches your eye! </p>

<ul><li>Google Docs added 40 new pageless templates aimed to help users "build high-quality, modern documents faster.</li><li>The new templates cover blog posts, press releases, business proposals, and journals, as well as specialized options for business and education Workspace users.</li><li>Google previously added similar modernized templates to Slides last month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's latest addition to Workspace is a set of 40 new pageless templates for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-is-tapping-into-gemini-to-whip-up-formatted-documents">Google Docs</a> that are available starting today. The company announced the new templates, which come with integrated Docs features, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/12/new-templates-in-google-docs.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>. Google says these are "high-quality, visually modern designs" that can be useful in a variety of situations, with specialized options for enterprise and education users.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-for-android-defaults-to-paginated-mode">pageless templates</a> feature document tabs and placeholder chips, two Google Docs features that were previously available. Document tabs help organize long documents into easily-digestible and navigable sections. Meanwhile, placeholder chips aim to simplify workflows by making it easy to fill in documents with people, dates, files, events, and places.</p><p>Aside from document tabs and placeholder chips, the 40 new templates are outfitted with custom designs, fonts, and structures. Google explains that there are templates for blog posts, press releases, business proposals, and journals, as well as specialized options such as:</p>
<ul><li>A project roadmap, marketing plan, and sales emails for <strong>business users. </strong></li><li>An interview guide, onboarding guide, and training manual for <strong>human resource teams. </strong></li><li>A reading list and class notes templates for <strong>education users. </strong></li></ul>

<p>There are a few ways to add a template to a new Google Doc, starting with a new <strong>Templates</strong> building block that will appear at the top of a blank document. Alternatively, you can choose a template by navigating through <strong>File > New > From template gallery</strong> in the Google Docs toolbar.</p><p>These new templates are available to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">all Google Workspace users</a>, though it may take some time for them to show up for everyone. Both rapid release and scheduled release domains are starting to see these 40 new templates starting today, but the rollout can take up to 15 days to complete.</p><p>Google says that users can expect "even more high-quality Docs template options in the coming months."</p>

<ul><li>A rumor on Weibo claims the Galaxy S25 series could support the new Qi2 wireless charging standard, launched in 2023.</li><li>It was stated that the method would only a charging strength of 15W on the S25 series, which is what Qi Power stated during its launch.</li><li>Qi2 support was originally expected for the Galaxy S24 series; however, the only phone (and first) to adopt it is the HMD Skyline.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent Galaxy S25 post spreads rumors about its potential (exciting) upgrade to its charging capabilities.</p><p>The rumors were reportedly started by Ice Universe on Weibo and highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1866139989215760439">Jukanlosreve</a> on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-qi2-magsafe-charging-accessories-rumor/">SamMobile</a>). Per the tipster, the Galaxy S25 series will supposedly utilize the new wireless charging standard, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins">Qi2</a>. Ice Universe supposedly discussed these details over private messages on Weibo.</p><p>The tipster added that the S25 series will support this method; however, devices charging wirelessly may only see 15W capabilities.</p><p>The stated charging strength isn't surprising as Qi Power announced as much when the Qi2 standard was launched late in November 2023.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ice Universe: The S25 series will feature Qi2.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1866139989215760439">December 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Qi2 met a late 2023 holiday season launch and the Wireless Power Consortium highlighted its roots in Apple's MagSafe technology. It's worth mentioning that the tech hit the iPhone 15 series <em>before </em>Qi2 got around to Android devices. Qi Power "promised" that its new standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi-v2-wireless-certification-process-begins">could provide</a> "greater energy efficiency, faster charging, and enhanced convenience" for Android.</p><p>Accessory manufacturers like Belkin, Mophie, Anker, and Aircharge entered certification to prepare for a market launch shortly after Qi2 was launched. We were excited, considering this meant Android phones could finally adopt its wireless charging method.</p><p>However, that has yet to happen — at least, in a widespread fashion. The first (and only) Android to support Qi2 wireless charging is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">the HMD Skyline</a>.</p><p>It was also expected that Samsung would jump on this new wireless charging trend, but it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-dropped-the-ball-qi2-galaxy-s24">dropped the ball with the Galaxy S24</a>. Instead, what we received was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-s-pen-magsafe-qi2-malfunction">S Pen malfunctions</a> with Qi2 magnet accessories, as noted by manufacturers trying to craft their latest products.</p><p>Qi2 is still a viable option for Samsung to deploy on its upcoming Galaxy S25 series. Though Android Central's Namerah Saud Fatmi <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/qi2-samsung-galaxy-s24-series">said the method</a> would keep the S24 series "exciting and alive," the same can probably be shifted over to the S25 flagship trio.</p><p>As always, we'll have to wait and see. The Galaxy S25 series is expected to launch during Galaxy Unpacked in January 2025.</p>
