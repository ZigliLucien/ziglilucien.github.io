However, as is the case every year, this is the start of a countdown of sorts until Samsung unveils its next lineup of flagship phones. As we've seen since Samsung started matching the "S" number to the year, 2026 will be no different, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Samsung Galaxy S26</a> will be here before you know it.</p><p>But with the 2025 holiday season upon us, you might be thinking that now's the perfect time to upgrade to one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. For some, you can probably proceed without thinking twice, but if you have your eyes set on the Galaxy S25, you might be wondering if you should wait for the Galaxy S26.</p><h2 id="what-are-we-expecting-from-the-galaxy-s26-2">What are we expecting from the Galaxy S26?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.70%;"><img id="rcJq6g3FrXH6vabXiVUcvD" name="Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5" alt="Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rcJq6g3FrXH6vabXiVUcvD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4037" height="2289" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There have already been a slew of rumors and supposed leaks, such as the Galaxy S26 "Pro" apparently replacing the S26, only for subsequent rumors to claim this won't be the case, while also suggesting other changes might be coming.</p><p>The most obvious upgrade coming to Samsung's next flagship smartphone is the processor upgrade. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> was announced in September and will be powering many of 2026's best Android phones. This includes the Galaxy S26, despite rumors suggesting Samsung might switch over to its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-might-rock-the-exynos-2600-chip-but-only-in-this-region">Exynos 2600</a>.</p><p>Instead, we'll likely see the same thing we've seen over the past few years. This means that those in the U.S. and a subset of other regions will see the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, while other markets will see Samsung's own chip at the helm.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-14" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Those rumors about Samsung shaking things up by replacing the Galaxy S26 Plus with the S26 Edge have been largely debunked by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/-may-not-be-an-s26-pro-either" target="_blank">more recent ones</a>. Samsung seems to like the idea of a fourth phone in its flagship lineup, and recently rumors claim that instead of replacing the Plus, the S26 Edge will simply be added to the mix or forgotten altogether.</p><p>If Samsung goes through with the Galaxy S26 Edge, it would bring about an additional option to consider, as you could either get the S26 Edge with its ultra-thin design or the S26 Plus with its telephoto lens and larger battery.</p><p>Beyond Samsung's internal struggle with how many phones will make up the S26 series, it seems that only one of these devices could see an upgrade in the camera department. Previous reports claim that the Galaxy S26 "would retain its predecessor's camera array," but that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-and-s26-pro-could-get-a-subtle-but-noticeable-reshuffle">S26 Ultra</a> might sport a "larger 200MP Sony main sensor."</p><p>Sadly, it doesn't seem like there are really any other major plans in store for any of the other cameras across the upcoming lineup of devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sW3uQWkmEtBdEiQ9idjoQP" name="Galaxy-s26-Ultra-leaked-Spen-slot" alt="S Pen support on Galaxy S26 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sW3uQWkmEtBdEiQ9idjoQP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ice Universe/ X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's also worth noting that many of the rumors and leaks so far suggest the S Pen isn't going anywhere just yet. There were concerns about this being the case following Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">removal of Bluetooth functionality from the S Pen</a> on the S25 Ultra and the removal of S Pen compatibility altogether from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-support-the-s-pen">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. While it doesn't seem Samsung plans to bring back an S Pen with Bluetooth for the S26 Ultra, at least it isn't getting rid of the stylus altogether.</p><h2 id="how-much-and-when-2">How much and when?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3469px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ruxqkP4xESvmADZCsm8UxN" name="samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025" alt="Galaxy Unpacked banner in New York City" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ruxqkP4xESvmADZCsm8UxN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3469" height="1952" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There haven't been many leaks spilling the beans on Samsung's pricing plans for the Galaxy S26 series. However, if Samsung were to bump up the price, now would be the time to do so, as we just saw Apple did just that with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, which launched in September 2025. That said, we don't expect the price increase to exceed another $100, and it may be limited to the Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><p>Last, but certainly not least, more recently, we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/when-will-samsung-launch-the-galaxy-s26-one-leaker-claims-itll-be-later-than-usual">rumors and reports</a> surfacing that Samsung might be planning to postpone its first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026">Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026</a>. Making matters worse for those considering an upgrade, it's said that Samsung could wait until March 2026 to unveil the Galaxy S26 lineup. Unfortunately, we aren't sure why this might be the case, but it could have something to do with adding a fourth model to the mix, or it could be preparing to unveil the rumored tri-fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-trifold-may-debut-in-the-us-amid-rumors-of-a-simultaneous-launch-event">Galaxy G Fold</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision is yours, and a lot of it depends on how desperate you are for an upgrade. If the S26 series were rumored to stick to the January announcement schedule, this would be a bit easier to decide, but if it comes in March, you'll be waiting over four months.</p><p>In which case, I'd probably just suggest that you wait until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals</a> start rolling in and grab the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 series</a> for less, as they're still very capable phones with plenty of AI to go around and years of software updates ahead.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="1eb2dea9-9201-406c-8319-fc122ea2e66b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7aPuds4bUohAeDeEDRcqi.jpg' alt="samsung galaxy s25 ultra square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The price cuts have started</strong></em></p><p>It's that time of the year when retailers and carriers start offering ridiculous deals on a variety of products.

It wasn't the best, but it still managed to make it through an entire day, even a year later.</p><p>However, Google's Pixel 10 Pro Fold promised to be even better, thanks to the move to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5</a> chip. By moving production from Samsung to TSMC, Google hoped its latest chip would be faster and more efficient. And, at least when it comes to efficiency, the 10 Pro Fold has delivered.</p><p>When running a battery test, which consisted of playing a 4K HDR video at full brightness with 50% volume, here's what I found:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Screen</p></th><th  ><p>Time</p></th><th  ><p>Battery</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Inner</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2:50</p></td><td  ><p>59%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>3:50</p></td><td  ><p>44%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>4:50</p></td><td  ><p>30%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Cover</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4:53</p></td><td  ><p>29%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>5:53</p></td><td  ><p>20%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see, with the 8-inch inner display, you're looking at about a 15% drop per hour. Naturally, less battery is consumed when using the cover screen, as the battery dropped by 9%.</p><p>Extrapolating that out, you're looking at about 8 hours with only the inner display, or a little more than 11 with the cover screen. That's been more than enough for me, as I have yet to feel the pinch of needing to find a charger before running out of juice.</p><p>For as great as battery life has been, the same can't be said for performance.

With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, I know there are going to be plenty of settings to fiddle around with, along with more tweaks and changes that I can make in order to enable various features that aren't there out of the box. At the same time, my expectation is to be able to use the Fold 7 for practically anything I need.</p><p>When picking up the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, I know there are certain limitations to what's possible, but for some reason, it doesn't bother me. The only other phone that makes me feel this way is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone</a>, as iOS and iPadOS are just way too locked down to really do much outside of what Apple wants me to do.</p><p>I've said this before, but I equate the Pixel 10 Pro Fold (and other Pixels) as being the "weekend phone." It's great for replying to messages, maybe playing a few games, and watching your favorite sports team. But it lacks some of the features that help make other foldables great.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UZLjL55Z9uC4KddG7K4YkU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-app-pair" alt="Multitasking on the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold with the new save app pair feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UZLjL55Z9uC4KddG7K4YkU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most notable of which is multitasking, as you're still limited to using only two apps at a time, even on the inner screen. I can't tell you how many times I've swiped up to grab an app from the taskbar, hoping to drag and drop it into a floating window, only to be reminded that it's just not possible.</p><p>Now, I'm not asking for the Samsung approach, where I can fit up to five or six apps on the screen at once. But come on, Google, just give me <em>something</em> more. I mean, it's an 8-inch screen — the same size as some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets" target="_blank">best Android tablets</a> — so there shouldn't be any reason we can't at least have <em>one</em> floating window.</p><div><blockquote><p>On the one hand, Google's multitasking implementation is great. But as soon as I want to do more, everything just feels clunky. </p></blockquote></div><p>Another annoyance is that, for whatever reason, Google doesn't let you have separate layouts between the Cover and Main screens. Everything you change on one is reflected on the other, but I don't always use the inner screen in the same way that I do the outer screen.</p><p>It would be one thing if these foldable phones and software were still in their infancy, but they aren't.

as much of a surprise, but the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is easily the stiffest competition. Samsung made huge changes with this year's release, removing the S Pen digitizer to make the slimmest phone.</p><p>Not only that, Samsung took things further and added the same 200MP primary camera found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. All of these changes came at a cost, however, as Samsung bumped up the price by $100.</p><p>In the U.S., that's pretty much all you get in terms of alternatives, at least if you wanted to walk into your local carrier and walk out with a new phone. In reality, there are actually quite a few formidable opponents, which include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a>.</p><p>The problem is that none of those phones are easily accessible in the U.S., meaning that you'll need to have them imported from abroad. This usually means paying a slight markup, but at least you aren't limited. However, the current political and economic climate is such that, in addition to paying a markup to import a phone, there's a good chance you'll have to pay a tariff on top of it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-should-you-buy-it"><span>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4468px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="asToP2HuW6Qv2CR3iJG6jn" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-review-hero-21x9-2" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold Review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/asToP2HuW6Qv2CR3iJG6jn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4468" height="2514" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p><ul><li>You want the first foldable phone with an IP68 rating.</li><li>You don't need a lot of extra bells and whistles.</li><li>You want a foldable phone that works with Pixelsnap (and MagSafe) accessories.</li><li>You need all-day battery life.</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if:</strong></p><ul><li>You want the best cameras on a foldable phone.</li><li>You want the slimmest and lightest foldable phone.</li><li>You're on a budget.</li></ul><p>For as much as I would love to tell you that this is <em>the</em> foldable phone for everyone, I just can't.

The company had been teasing its new phone quite a bit lately, and now we know exactly what to expect from the global device's full specifications and features.</p><p>First off, the OnePlus 15 shows up looking a lot different from its predecessor, as we have noted multiple times in previous leaks and teases. It ditches the phone's circular camera bump on its rear panel for a more iPhone-esque camera array, off to the left of the device. The phone comes with a smoother finish and rounded corners, ditching the boxier look of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13.</a></p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.opposhop.cn/cn/web/products/36995.html">Chinese product listing page</a> of the OnePlus 15 notes that it will be powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset. As for the display, it gets a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED display with a 1.5K resolution and a massive 165Hz refresh rate. It also gets exceptionally thin 1.15mm bezels, giving users more screen space to play with.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q7tvXG4UWQn9jHGM3mxMjN" name="OnePlus15-SandStorm- edition" alt="OnePlus 15 launches" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q7tvXG4UWQn9jHGM3mxMjN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, the OnePlus 15 gets a massive  7,300mAh battery that supports 120W  fast charging and 50W wireless charging. Coming to its camera setup, the phone shows up with three 50MP lenses. This includes a 50MP main camera (with a larger sensor than its predecessor and OIS), a 50MP ultrawide camera, and a 50MP periscope telephoto lens that offers 3.5x optical zoom and OIS. Speaking of ditching, this phone lets go of <strong> </strong>the Alert Slider, which is replaced by a customizable '<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">Plus Key.'</a></p><p>The phone also features a 32MP selfie camera, and it is also shown without the Hasselblad logo, indicating the presence of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-shift-from-hasselblad-official-debuts-detailmax-engine">DetailMax imaging</a> engine, which is said to enhance picture quality.

In a recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.directv.com/dtvassets/pdfs/3780993-2025-emerging-trends.pdf">published document</a>, the satellite TV provider detailed its plan to help hoteliers improve the visitor experience in rooms. To do this, DirecTV highlighted its new "Advanced Entertainment Platform," otherwise known as the AEP.</p><p>The purpose of the AEP, according to DirecTV, is to help "further enhance guest personalization." Additionally, the AEP enables deep-rooted customization opportunities for the hotel, letting them "customize the home screen with a brand's logo, colors, or image, and a custom welcome message."</p><p>As the publication points out, Google TV is at the core of DirecTV's AEP. The TV provider states that its AEP will bring live TV, popular streaming services, and "on-demand content," which is likely driven by Google's experience (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">Android TV OS</a>). The AEP's Partner Program will let hotels "layer" some uniqueness for their guests. As such, the document states that, aside from entertainment, visitors can find a hotel's hours of operation and times for restaurants, spas, gyms, and more using their TV remote.</p><p>Moreover, hotels can leverage the AEP to even showcase menus for dishes served in the building. The post reports that Google TV and DirecTV are eyeing a release of the AEP in hotels sometime in 2026.</p><h2 id="the-tv-experience-continues-to-evolve-2">The TV experience continues to evolve</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1307px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.91%;"><img id="Y2kef4qG8eX7r8cyhZGt6C" name="google-tv-directv-aep-hotels-2026" alt="DirecTV's AEP prepares a clean, customizable look for hotels to fully change and provide the entertainment its visitors may enjoy during their stay, with room for a custom logo, certain streaming apps, a unique background, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y2kef4qG8eX7r8cyhZGt6C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1307" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: DirecTV)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The post by 9to5 highlights DirecTV's ambition to let hotel guests attach their Google accounts temporarily to the AEP, Google TV combo.

As teased during CES 2025, Gemini with Google TV lets users speak "naturally" to the AI for season recaps, entertainment recommendations, and more. Users can even get personal, telling the AI to try and find content that bridges the gap between two wildly different content preferences.</p><p>Gemini's addition brings something for kids, enabling them to learn about the world's captivating occurrences, like volcanic eruptions. The company said it would begin bringing this upgrade to TCL QM9K series devices first, before looking at its own Google TV Streamer, Walmart onn. 4K Pro, 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and more "later this year."</p><p>There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/android-tv/google-tv-could-soon-let-you-create-ai-videos-right-from-your-couch">were some rumors</a> that Google might have even more in store with its AI, but a feature that could let users get a little creative with its generative capabilities.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These posts have a dashed outline, so everyone knows what it is, as well as a timer that says how much time remains.</p><p>All replies to your ghost post are sent right to your DMs. You will see a snippet of the ghost post, just so you're aware of what someone is replying to. Moreover, only the creator can see who "liked" the post, too.</p><p>While Meta says this feature is launching today, we haven't yet noticed it appear in the Threads app. However, it should begin appearing for users as the week progresses.</p><h2 id="the-new-meta-on-threads-2">The new meta on Threads</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:862px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.61%;"><img id="tgCGNC6Y6zHGUug2YVBX9F" name="meta-threads-ghost-posts-example" alt="Threads adds "ghost posts," a feature that users can toggle to create a post that vanishes in 24 hours, and all replies are sent to your DMs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tgCGNC6Y6zHGUug2YVBX9F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="862" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ghost posts are just another way users can interact with others on Threads, and keep the experience feeling fresh. Meta highlights an update from September, which brought "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/09/attach-text-threads-posts-share-longer-perspectives/">text attachments</a>." The main highlight in that update was the increased 10,000 text character limit for longer posts. Not only did this let users write even more, expanding on their ideas and thoughts, but Meta says it gives others a chance to post article excerpts to kickstart discussions.</p><p>Earlier this month, Threads rolled out yet another update that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/threads-is-rolling-out-group-chats-and-expands-messaging-to-the-eu">brought group chat support</a> to the app. Users can now fully engage in group chats with up to 50 people. Expanding on this, Threads provides the option to customize your chat name while it prepares invite links for more people. Messaging others on Threads now also supports photos, videos, GIFs, and stickers, as well as "smart" privacy options.</p><p>Threads started rolling out its entire messaging experience, equipped with group chats, to users in the EU, too.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-128gb-unlocked-awesome-lime/JJGRF3CK9C" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy will give you up to $140 off the already affordable Samsung Galaxy A36 5G when you have them connect it to your carrier for you</strong></a>, or $40 off if you prefer to do it yourself. This brings the price point down to just $260 with activation, marking a solid deal for anyone who prefers to buy their phone outright instead of utilizing a payment plan.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-the-existence-of-the-unreleased-galaxy-a56-a36-and-a26">Galaxy A36 was launched</a> alongside the A26 and A56 earlier this year, with all three offering an economy price point for a few subtle downgrades. The A36 sports a decent-looking, 6.7-inch AMOLED display, and either 128GB or 256GB of storage—though this deal is for the base-level option.</p><p>The phone is available in colors dubbed Awesome Lime, Awesome Black, and Awesome Lavender, and they're all eligible for the discount at the time of writing. While you certainly shouldn't expect a premium phone out of the A36, it's still a good option for the price point, and definitely worth consideration at this sale price.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-128gb-unlocked-awesome-lime/JJGRF3CK9C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="DB9b8Qd9NnHbgaVhT7ZvT5" name="samsung galaxy a36 square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DB9b8Qd9NnHbgaVhT7ZvT5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy A36 5G (128GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-128gb-unlocked-awesome-lime/JJGRF3CK9C" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$399.99</del> <strong>$259.99 with activation at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Samsung's affordable Galaxy A36 just got hit with up to $140 off for Best Buy's spooky season sale, so long as you let them connect the device to a carrier for you.

It offers a budget-friendly alternative to some of the maker's mid-range and premium-level phones, without compromising too much in the way of hardware or performance.</p><p>For starters, it's backed by 6GB of RAM and a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 Octa-Core processor, and this particular deal is for the 128GB storage option, though Samsung also offers a 256GB version. It also has a 5,000mAh battery, fast charging speeds of up to 45W, and a 6.7-inch AMOLED display that gets the job done. As for cameras, it includes a 12MP selfie cam, a 50MP regular rear-facing lens as well as an 8MP ultrawide.</p><p>All in all, it seems like a pretty decent pick for the price point, especially if you let Best Buy handle activation for you.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It wants to further its business model — that's eyeballs on the internet — and is using its own line of products to help make it happen.</p><p>Of course, it would love to have a profitable phone division and make money there, too.

And Android Fitbit Premium users are getting first access to it.</p><p>Rolling out in Public Preview tomorrow, the Fitbit Personal Health Coach will show the same health and fitness data as before — like Cardio Load, Steps, Daily Readiness, Sleep Score, and more — but in easily digestible widget form, emphasizing weekly or monthly trends.</p><p>Most notably, the Public Preview starts with a 5–10 minute conversation where you help the built-in AI coach "understand your motivations and goals." It can then build a personalized, week-to-week plan that goes well beyond the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-fitbit-ai-daily-run-recommendations-helped-me-run-better">daily AI running recommendations</a>; it can prioritize a wide range of sports and build workouts from "over 1,000" possible exercises.</p><h2 id="how-the-fitbit-personal-health-coach-plans-work-2">How the Fitbit Personal Health Coach plans work</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AZyByJLKEZu7xNrQEkXVGD" name="fitbit-personal-health-coach-workout-plans" alt="Fitbit Personal Health Coach screenshots showing two potential workout plans, one to "Improve stride length, balanced with light strength," and the other replacing a tempo run with a stretch workout because the user is flying to Greece the next day." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZyByJLKEZu7xNrQEkXVGD.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fitbit's goal was to build an "agentic health coach" that can create a multi-week workout plan for any fitness goal, but then allow users to adjust their plan in response to unexpected injuries, travel, busy days at work, or any other context. It's "built on Gemini," but uses "different models" depending on the context, not just one version like 2.5 Pro or Flash.</p><p>The Fitbit Coach can build a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/choosing-the-best-marathon-training-smartwatch-for-my-upcoming-garmin-marathon">marathon training plan</a> targeting a specific date — like other fitness apps — with up to six weeks of workouts at a time, including cross-training workouts across a wide range of sports. Fitbit says it's "working on" adding a "further outlook" to support longer-term plans.</p><p>What's more interesting is that your Fitbit plan doesn't need to be so targeted or specific. It can be to "get ready for ski season" or "become a better trail runner." The AI will use this information to build workouts that target relevant muscle groups.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G3aqxiLYwqjEWPd8CoJ6HD" name="fitbit-personal-health-coach-today-tab-ask-coach-and-join-public-preview" alt="Three Fitbit app screenshots of the new Personal Health Coach: (left) the new Today tab with widgets for Cardio percentage, steps, Readiness score, Sleep duration, with a more in-depth Sleep widget below; (center) the Ask Coach tab where the user can ask for advice; (right) the Public Preview Program page where Fitbit users can sign up for the program." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G3aqxiLYwqjEWPd8CoJ6HD.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A Fitbit rep showed us his personal Gemini-built plan, with a recommended "Skip Prep Power Circuit" for that day. It included specific exercises like Leg Blasters and Jump Squats, and the user can change the number of reps, ask the AI to choose new exercises that target the same muscle groups, or see videos with the proper form. You log each exercise as complete in the app once you're done.</p><p>During the onboarding session, Fitbit will ask what exercise equipment you have access to, such as a Peloton or dumbbells. It'll use that context when assigning you specific exercises. But if you're traveling, you can "Adjust workout" and tell the AI Coach to "Create a 30-minute upper body workout I can do in my hotel room" and have a new activity in moments.</p><p>The same would apply if you were sick, had an injury, or couldn't make it to the gym that day. Fitbit's flexibility means you can't simply decide you don't have time or the capacity for your planned workout; it can always find something new that's still relevant to your goals.</p><h2 id="everything-else-fitbit-personal-health-coach-can-or-can-t-do-2">Everything else Fitbit Personal Health Coach can or can't do</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1436px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XqWDqyuYSjbYubqX3TSTAD" name="Fitbit-personal-health-coach-hero-image" alt="A screenshot showing "Hello: I'm your personal health coach" on a dark background with text bubbles surrounding the text with sample questions for the Fitbit AI coach." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XqWDqyuYSjbYubqX3TSTAD.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1436" height="808" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can open your Gemini app right now, ask "Why am I so tired?" and get a general answer with several possibilities.

You can ask it to summarize what it knows about you and get a <em>massive</em> text dump of information, or ask about your trends for a specific data point like HRV.</p><p>Even if you don't know what to ask, the Fitbit app will have customized "insight" widgets that show useful information related to your health, sleep, and fitness trends, shown in the examples below.

The company launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-2a">Nothing Phone 3a</a> and Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">Phone 3a Pro</a> earlier this year, and now the London-based brand appears set for the final phone in the lineup — the Nothing Phone 3a Lite.</p><p>Nothing has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/45651-phone-3a-lite-light-up-the-everyday">revealed</a> that it will officially take the wraps off the device on 29 October 2025 at 13:00 GMT (9:00 AM ET), which is just a couple of days away now. While the company hasn't shared much about the phone, the teaser posted on X suggests the Phone 3a Lite might skip the extensive array of lights usually seen on Nothing smartphones for a single LED.</p><h2 id="nothing-confirms-phone-3a-lite-is-launching-october-29-2">Nothing confirms Phone (3a) Lite is launching October 29</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phone (3a) Lite. 29.10. 13.00 GMT.Light up the everyday. pic.twitter.com/VVNclQ6mEl<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1982718918536954334">October 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Another notable takeaway from the teaser is that the Phone 3a Lite will continue using the company's transparent design language. Nothing has previously unveiled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget smartphones</a>, but all under its CMF sub-brand, which doesn't use the same transparent design and instead opts for bright colors and an industrial finish.</p><p>The Phone 3a Lite will be the company's first smartphone to feature entry-level specs paired with the design we've seen on its mid-range and flagship models.</p><p>In terms of specs, a leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/nothing-phone-3a-lite/">Xpertpick</a> claims the smartphone will come in a single 8GB+128GB configuration and two colors: Black and White. It will reportedly be priced at €249.99 in France (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/nothing-phone-3a-lite-un-modele-plus-abordable-attendu-pour-novembre-2025-60679">Delabs</a>) and available for purchase starting November 4, 2025.</p><p>Unlike other Nothing smartphones, the company hasn't shared much about the Phone 3a Lite ahead of its release, which is quite unusual. That said, we don't have to wait long, as the phone is set to go official in just a couple of days.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It marked the arrival of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> a few months earlier than I originally expected, but OnePlus is forging ahead with a classy new flagship phone design and a bunch of new camera tricks up its sleeve.</p><p>This is the first flagship OnePlus phone in years to drop the Hasselblad branding in favor of the company's new in-house <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-shift-from-hasselblad-official-debuts-detailmax-engine">DetailMax Engine</a>. If I've had any one complaint about the OnePlus 13's camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review">since I reviewed it earlier this year</a>, it's that the Hasselblad processing can sometimes be too aggressive with its contrast and often tones down vibrant colors too much for my liking.</p><p>So far, the new DetailMax Engine looks to fix both of these issues, giving me a more realistic picture that looked like what my eyes saw, not what the camera software thought might look better. The weather has been fairly abysmal in my part of the world this weekend, but I was able to head up to the mountains at the end of last week while it was a clear, calm morning and capture Fall in a way that felt authentic.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0

However, some users reported issues with scrolling in the Home tab on iOS following the overhaul. In the version 4.1 revision, Google says the Home tab experience is now "smoother and more responsive."</p><p>The company also fixed a bug affecting the color status for items in the <strong>Lights</strong> category on the Android app. The prior version failed to change color when a light was turned off, but it now turns grey as expected.</p><p>Finally, the Google Home app now includes a fix for Ask Home summaries being described incorrectly. The release notes explain that summaries were sometimes called "today's Home Brief" when they were actually about the day prior.</p><h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-use-ask-home-in-the-new-google-home-app-2">What do I need to use Ask Home in the new Google Home app?</h2><p>Google is rolling out Ask Home to more users with the release of version 4.1 of the Home app, but you'll need a Google Home Premium subscription.

The company made Meta Ray-Ban Display only available for purchase after completing an in-store demo. The reasoning behind the decision was so that customers could interact with the device and get a proper sizing for the sEMG wristband before buying it.</p><p>Naturally, that made getting a Meta Ray-Ban Display a bit trickier at launch. There were some initial scheduling hiccups, as recounted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RaybanMeta/comments/1nvlxl5/update_on_meta_rayban_displays_the_info_they/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a>, and limited demo availability. Demos and delivery dates quickly slipped into November and December. Initially, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-put-the-future-of-tech-on-your-face">Meta said the Ray-Ban Display demos</a> would be available at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/best-buy">Best Buy</a>, LensCrafters, Ray-Ban Stores, and Verizon stores.</p><p>Verizon is only now starting to carry Meta Ray-Ban Display and accept demo bookings for the smart glasses. The first day of availability is Nov. 5, and you can schedule a demo slot now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/demo/scheduler/" target="_blank">Meta's website</a>. If you're lucky enough to live near a Verizon store offering Meta Ray-Ban Display demos, you might not have to wait long — there are still plenty of opening-week demos at Verizon stores at the time of publishing.</p><p>After completing the demo, you can buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> straight from Verizon. It doesn't look like you need to be a Verizon customer to buy a pair, and they're available for the same $799 retail price at the wireless carrier. However, only the Black colorway is sold at Verizon, so you're out of luck if you're on the hunt for Sand.</p><h2 id="which-verizon-stores-will-offer-meta-ray-ban-display-demos-2">Which Verizon stores will offer Meta Ray-Ban Display demos?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dKQz3aLAYpWp5qsFRU2ebm" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-glasses-close-up-front" alt="A close-up photo of the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses held facing the camera to show the design, camera cutouts, and lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dKQz3aLAYpWp5qsFRU2ebm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For now, demo availability of Meta Ray-Ban Display is quite limited at Verizon stores.

The streaming service debuted in 2015 along YouTube Premium, and a decade later, it has over 125 million paid subscribers as of March 2025. The large subscriber count and user base allows <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> to inject more cash into the music industry, and it hit a big milestone in 2025.</p><p>YouTube paid out more than $8 billion to the music industry in the year between July 2024 and June 2025, it said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/8-billion-youtubes-twin-engine-continues-to-fuel-the-future-of-music/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The brand says this major payout reaffirms its "commitment to the music industry." It's the most YouTube Music has ever paid out to artists and the music industry at large in a 12-month period, and shows that payouts are rising with subscriber counts.</p><p>"Today's $8 billion payout is a testament to the fact that the twin engine of ads and subscriptions is firing on all cylinders," said Lyor Cohen, who is YouTube's global head of music, in the blog post. "This number is not an endpoint; it represents meaningful, sustained progress in our journey to build a long-term home for every artist, songwriter, and publisher on the global stage."</p><p>The company attributes the larger payouts to what it calls a "twin-engine revenue model." That includes subscriber revenue from the over 125 million users that pay for either YouTube Music or YouTube Premium. It also includes logged-in viewers who watch music videos on YouTube and see ads — YouTube says there are 2 billion of them each month.</p><p>Between revenue sharing from subscribers and ad-supported users, YouTube Music was able to pay out the $8 billion figure to the music industry.</p><h2 id="how-youtube-music-s-payout-compares-to-itself-and-the-competition-2">How YouTube Music's payout compares to itself — and the competition</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XfwbFm6ePPoVYnfBaTi7mC" name="YouTube-Music-Beyond-the-Beat" alt="YouTube Music Beyond the Beat" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XfwbFm6ePPoVYnfBaTi7mC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3488" height="1962" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube Music's payouts are rising with its subscriber count. It paid out $4 billion to the music industry in 2021, $6 billion in 2022, and now $8 billion in 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/youtube-paid-out-8b-to-the-music-industry-in-12-months/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>). Spotify, the industry leader and YouTube Music's biggest competitor, paid $10 billion to the music industry in 2024.</p><p>While YouTube Music isn't quite on Spotify's level yet, it's inching closer. Despite having far fewer subscribers, YouTube Music's industry payout is impressive because it pays more on a per-stream basis than Spotify, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://report.duetti.co/#1" target="_blank">Duetti</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/26/chrome-141-android-m3-expressive-redesign/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the rollout has been completed for most users, marking the end of the gradual deployment that began in late August.</p><p>Now, tapping the three-dot menu brings forward key actions (forward, bookmark, download, site info, refresh) inside circular icons.</p><p>In the Tab Grid view, the “+” for opening a new tab now lives inside a rounded square, and tabs, Incognito, and Groups all have clearer containers. Dynamic Color theming is applied (so it adapts to your wallpaper or chosen palette).</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:421px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:206.65%;"><img id="3TKQAwquFSsBicgaKpKwNj" name="Chrome-for-Android-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive on Chrome for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3TKQAwquFSsBicgaKpKwNj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="421" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:207.14%;"><img id="j4bNLtSPUkq8UmZu2dCGFj" name="Chrome-for-Android-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive on Chrome for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j4bNLtSPUkq8UmZu2dCGFj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="420" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="no-functional-shake-up-2">No functional shake-up</h2><p>Despite the splashier look, Chrome didn’t adjust button sizes or radically alter list-views or settings pages. It’s more a cosmetic refresh than a full redesign. The browser’s interface remains familiar enough that you won’t feel lost.</p><p>That means if you’re used to how Chrome worked before, you’ll still feel right at home. The update is more about aligning with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Google’s broader design language</a> across apps than reinventing everything.</p><p>There are smaller details, too. Watch as a page loads, and you'll notice a segmented progress indicator with rounded corners. Similarly, when you visit a website you've already bookmarked, the star icon in the menu will now have a rounded square background.</p><p>If you haven’t seen the new look yet, there’s a reason: the rollout is server-side. That means even if your Chrome version says 141 or higher, you may still be waiting for the visual switch to hit your device. Quick tip: force-stop the app (via Android Settings → Apps → Chrome → Force Stop) and then reopen it. That sometimes triggers the update faster.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After leading the foldable market with the Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip, the company plans to reveal its first tri-fold smartphone later this week. But according to a recent rumor, the launch will be limited, and the U.S. probably won't get it right away.</p><p>The Korean tech giant is set to pull the wraps off the Galaxy Z TriFold at the APEC CEO Summit in South Korea, happening October 28–31. This launch marks the company’s jump into a completely new device category, featuring a dual-hinge setup that lets the phone fold twice.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-just-showed-off-its-unfolding-trick-in-a-leaked-animation">feature a dual-hinge in-folding design</a>, meaning both sides fold inward toward the main display. When closed, the phone looks like a typical smartphone with a 6.5-inch cover display, but once unfolded in stages, it can expand to 8 inches and, fully opened, stretch to a massive 10-inch screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:763px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.67%;"><img id="R26KV66tJrgcF2TQna9q9Y" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Trifold-unfolding" alt="unfolding and folding mechanism of the Galaxy Z Trifold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R26KV66tJrgcF2TQna9q9Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="763" height="585" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @TechHighest / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Early reports suggest Samsung has been refining the hinge durability and optimizing the display software to ensure seamless transitions between folded modes. Under the hood, the TriFold is rumored to run on last year’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset rather than Qualcomm’s latest processor.</p><p>The price will put this phone firmly in the ultra-premium range, with estimates around 4 million won, or about $2,780. To reduce risk, Samsung is reportedly limiting the first batch to about 50,000 units, which makes sense since this is still an experimental product.</p><h2 id="western-markets-might-be-skipped-2">Western markets might be skipped</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unfortunately for foldable enthusiasts -- and despite recent rumors to the contrary -- I think it's very unlikely that Samsung will release its first trifold beyond Korea, the greater Chinese market (including Singapore & Taiwan), & possibly the UAE. I'd love to be wrong, though.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1982509687905137018">October 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The biggest twist in the story? The Galaxy Z TriFold might not even make it to the United States, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-trifold-may-debut-in-the-us-amid-rumors-of-a-simultaneous-launch-event">contrary to previous reports</a>. Instead, it will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-trifold-phone-on-course-for-us-launch">debut in select regions</a>, including South Korea, China, Singapore, Taiwan, and the UAE, as per reliable leaker Evan Blass on X.</p><p>The tri-fold concept is as ambitious as it is untested, and Samsung seems to be treating it as a high-end showcase instead of a product for everyone. As the company moves into this new area, people will be watching to see how the TriFold performs in real life, including its hinge strength, battery life, and how well Android works with the changing screen sizes.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold could set the tone for the next generation of portable devices that blur the lines between phones, tablets, and even small laptops.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature quietly started rolling out this week, with a Pixel 10 Pro owner reporting on Reddit that they can now enable Voice Translate during a phone call.</p><p>Voice Translate is one of the standout features introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10</a> series, powered by the new Tensor G5 chip. What sets it apart from previous translation tools is how it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/tech-talk-how-can-ai-translate-text-and-speech-in-real-time">works seamlessly during live phone calls</a>. When enabled, the feature listens to your voice, translates what you say into the recipient’s language, and then reproduces it in your own voice.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1oh9u4d/google_turned_on_voice_translate_in_europe_nl">Google turned on voice translate in Europe (NL)</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones">r/pixel_phones</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>The person on the other end doesn’t need a Pixel — they simply hear your translated message naturally, as if you were speaking their language. At the same time, you hear their translated response in your language, creating a surprisingly fluid two-way conversation.</p><p>All of this happens on-device, meaning translations don’t rely on Google’s servers or an internet connection. The translation models are processed locally through Tensor G5’s AI cores, which keeps the process private, fast, and secure. This also means no call audio or transcripts are uploaded or stored in the cloud.</p><h2 id="easy-to-activate-2">Easy to activate</h2><p>Once activated, users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-use-voice-translate-during-phone-calls">manually select their preferred languages</a>, download necessary language packs, and start using Voice Translate by tapping the “Call Assist” button during a call.</p><p>While users in the Netherlands seem to be among the first to receive the feature, German Pixel 10 owners have yet to see it appear in their settings. Oddly enough, Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/374421867/communicate-across-languages-with-voice-translate-on-pixel-10" target="_blank">support page</a> for the feature lists German as one of the official languages supported, alongside French, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.</p><p>Several users in Germany have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1n5x278/voice_translate_feature_missing_on_my_new_pixel/" target="_blank">confirmed</a> on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1oh9u4d/comment/nlmhl57/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> that Voice Translate remains missing. Some speculate that this may be due to Google’s gradual rollout across Europe. It’s not uncommon for Google to roll out experimental AI features in phases, especially when dealing with voice-based technologies that must comply with local regulations.</p><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How do I activate and use Voice Translate during a call?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Once the feature is available, users can enable it by manually selecting their preferred languages, downloading the necessary language packs, and tapping the “Call Assist” button during a phone call.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

The Ray-Ban manufacturer tapped its design expertise to make these glasses look <em>normal</em> (if thick) with dozens of variations; other tech brands can't offer this variety or leverage in-person glasses stores for fittings.</p><p>The Wayfarers are the default look, boxy and a bit generic to "blend in" the most, while the rounded-edge Headliners and Skylers soften the thick-framed look somewhat.</p><p>Whichever style you choose, I recommend splurging on the Transitions lenses. I don't use them indoors that often, but if I'm out for a long activity, they give me good eye protection to start and then switch to clear once the sun goes down.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E6yCUezNGeLmwd6NVhfnL3" name="Ray-Ban-Gen-2-versus-Gen-1-with-case" alt="Photo of the Shiny Cosmic Blue Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer glasses sitting on concrete in the foreground, with the black Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) Wayfarer sunglasses to their right and the official Ray-Ban charging case behind both sets of glasses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E6yCUezNGeLmwd6NVhfnL3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As I wrote in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 first impressions</a>, longer battery life is their most important upgrade. The old version had a 4-hour max but rarely lasted that long, and doubling the max capacity without the glasses getting noticeably heavier is worth praising.</p><p>I've never hit Meta's eight-hour estimate, but only because I tend to use the Gen 2s heavily: nonstop music streaming, plenty of 3K videos, and Meta AI commands. Meta's five-hour estimate with music aligns with my experience, about 20% per hour while using all the main features.</p><p>Whenever I've gone out and <em>only</em> taken photos or asked Meta a few questions, it's much closer to the 12.5%/hour that Meta promises, with little battery use while idling.

Meta also says it'll eventually support 1200p at 60 FPS, but that setting still hasn't arrived as of late October.</p><p>You can see the Oakley video test above from Android Central's Nick Sutrich showing how the new 3K video setting compares to 1080p on the Gen 1s. My findings are similar to his: 3K HDR videos give you more detail, better contrast, and less compression than the 1080p setting, especially in well-lit areas; in dimly lit rooms or at night, Ray-Ban videos are blurry and dull on either setting.</p><p>For mobile videos — like recording <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/running-a-half-marathon-with-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">while running a half-marathon</a> — the 1080p setting is better, while 3K is distractingly shaky.

Or are they not the right fit?</p><p>During my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-hands-on">Vanguard glasses hands-on</a>, I introduced the Garmin-Meta integration and why these smart glasses have become a regular companion for my workouts. But I acknowledged that some Garmin tools are more useful than others, and that some athletes will be uncomfortable sharing workout data with Meta.</p><p>Here, I'll go more in-depth on the Garmin features available on Oakley Meta Vanguard (and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses</a> once they receive the update). Here's how it works in practice, which features work best, and whether Garmin fans should care.</p><h2 id="compatible-garmin-devices-2">Compatible Garmin devices</h2><ul><li>D2 Mach 1 (Pro)</li><li>Edge 540 / 550 / 840 / 850 / 1040 / 1050 / MTB</li><li>Enduro 2 / 3</li><li>EPIX Pro / Gen 2</li><li>Fenix 7 / 7S / 7X (Pro) / 8 (Pro) / E</li><li>Forerunner 165 / 265 / 570 / 965 / 970</li><li>MARQ Gen 2</li><li>Quatix 7 (Pro) / 8</li><li>Tactix 7 (Pro) / 8</li><li>Venu 3 / 4 / X1</li><li>Vivoactive 5 / 6</li></ul><p>Most new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> work, but not older models.

Once you start a workout, you can say, "Hey Meta, what's my current running power?" or "What's my average heart rate?" and Meta will pull that data from your watch or bike computer — though your phone needs to be there as an intermediary.</p><p>I appreciate that I can ask Meta AI for stats Garmin tracks that I never added to my activity data screens.</p><p>More generally, some athletes need to keep their eyes forward for safety (cyclists) or can't easily check their wrist during exercise (weightlifters), while others want to use their watch's display for maps (hikers, trail runners). Having audio access to core Garmin stats without breaking stride is a nice perk.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Y4Dmfvii5FvCZGz7qejWDb" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-run-widget" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing the main Running widget, with time, distance, pace, and heart rate." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y4Dmfvii5FvCZGz7qejWDb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To make this feature even better, Meta AI should listen for special keywords when it detects an active Garmin activity. Saying "Hey Meta, what's my X" every time is annoying when you're breathing hard; simply saying "Heart rate," "Pace," or other commonly requested stats would be more seamless.</p><p>Another downside is that Meta AI can't describe <em>every</em> real-time stat, even if it understands what I'm asking. I asked for stride length and got my cadence; instead of speed, it said my pace. Some more obscure stats, like real-time stamina or total calories, stumped the AI.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="UpSL26Qj6wXE7z6nDDxTKE" name="Engo-2-AR-glasses-on-face" alt="ENGO 2 AR glasses worn on the author's face in a selfie photo; the angle shows how thick the HUD portion of the glasses is." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UpSL26Qj6wXE7z6nDDxTKE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nRQhMPnYwnDaQnViacY4Dn" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-glasses-on-face" alt="A selfie of the author wearing the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses with transition lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nRQhMPnYwnDaQnViacY4Dn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Despite these nitpicks — which I think Meta and Garmin will address over time — real-time stats are one of the Oakley Meta Vanguard's best features for Garmin users obsessed with data.</p><p>I'm sure some of you would prefer sporty Meta HUD glasses like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ar-running-glasses-arent-ready-yet-but-future-is-almost-here">ENGO 2s</a> to see your real-time stats without having to ask.

The Vanguards capture a five-second video clip after each trigger; once you've finished your workout, Meta takes these clips and any other photos and videos you captured manually, then organizes them into a shareable montage video, with a Garmin widget showing your live stats at each point.</p><p>You can edit which clips or stats (distance, pace, ascent, time, HR, or power) appear in the video, as well as whether to include the original audio, which tends to be heavy breathing and audio spill, in my case.</p><p>For an exciting marathon or trail run with gorgeous scenery, Autocapture summarizes your experience in a fun way, whether for social media or your own memories. But I have a few fundamental issues.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="c35922bo7jz8iM5sZXpMED" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-held-in-hand" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses held in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c35922bo7jz8iM5sZXpMED.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, the "smart triggers" only stumble into a few compelling shots by accident. It's mostly stitched-together footage of random moments of my runs, none especially noteworthy unless I took them myself.</p><p>Collected together, the footage is interesting, but Meta dumps each five-second clip into your Photos app after the workout, cluttering up your storage. I'd prefer that Meta delete any auto-shot clips after you've edited the compilation.</p><p>Most importantly, it's incredibly awkward to have your glasses start auto-recording when someone is walking toward you on a public path. The last thing I want is for people to assume I'm intentionally recording them, but I can't stop triggers from... triggering; I can only look away awkwardly.</p><p>Overall, I think the feature is quite cool in a vacuum, but I won't use Autocapture outside of public race events where people expect to be recorded, or empty trails.</p><h2 id="status-led-2">Status LED</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="duQXj2sNo7hPzKtP5FyVkC" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Status-LED" alt="A close-up of the Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses' inner-right arm and right lens, where a red Status LED is visible along the right lens's edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/duQXj2sNo7hPzKtP5FyVkC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Start a workout with a target HR, pace, or power zone, and Meta's inward-facing LED — usually indicating Meta AI or video recording is active — will light up red whenever you're out of zone.</p><p>It's elegantly simple. Since Garmin's out-of-zone and back-in-zone vibrations feel the same, you have to look at your watch every time, which can be distracting. The red LED in your periphery removes any uncertainty, letting you keep your gaze forward while adjusting your pace.</p><p>Eventually, I think it'd be cool if Meta showed red or blue LEDs to indicate above- or below-zone warnings, respectively.</p><h2 id="activity-summaries-2">Activity Summaries</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tUM7HYULTzMSsSJEypdh4U" name="meta-ai-summary-screenshots-garmin" alt="Meta AI app screenshots showing summaries of three separate runs, describing how the efforts compared against past activities." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tUM7HYULTzMSsSJEypdh4U.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is arguably the most odd Garmin-Meta integration. Whether you're running with Meta glasses or not, the Meta AI app will summarize every workout you finish within the context of your last 30 days of workouts, focused on specific stats like pace, cadence, and distance.</p><p>Meta AI will intelligently recommend recovery days after hard runs or suggest "incorporating interval training or speed work" if Meta thinks you're taking things too easy. Its comparisons to past runs are similar to what you'd see from Strava's Athlete Intelligence, only without a subscription.</p><p>I've found that these summaries tend to be dismissive of shorter, low-aerobic runs, saying "no significant trend was detected," and Meta AI only seems to interpret a few workout types, having no opinion on my recent hike.

For now, Garmin watch owners have the best perks, but they'll need to decide based on software <em>and</em> hardware.</p><p>I think the Vanguard's Oakley Sphaera aesthetic looks great, the weight is a bit heavy but manageable, and the Prizm lenses offer excellent eye protection. The speakers are impressively loud — to the point that they cause audio bleed — and the cameras take immersive, high-res photos and smooth, auto-stabilized video. Plus, the battery life is good enough to survive a marathon, in my testing.</p><p>If you don't want to give up your current workout earbuds and sunglasses, pay $500 atop an already expensive Garmin watch, or share your workout data with Meta, then Vanguard won't be the right fit.

They might not know that artificial intelligence is powering the broadcasts behind the scenes, specifically Gemini and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-cloud-is-adding-six-new-ai-agents-for-devs-scientists-and-power-users">Google Cloud</a>.</p><p>Google published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/fox-sports-major-league-baseball/" target="_blank">blog post</a> detailing its AI efforts in the World Series, and it's an interesting look into how the technology is being used in the real world. It starts with a platform called Fox Foresight, which uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and Google Cloud smarts to provide quick insights into baseball stats and trends.</p><p>Fox Foresight is trained on data from "many seasons" of Major League Baseball play, "down to the smallest details," according to Google. The tool aims to provide timely answers — ideally in seconds — to specific questions based on in-game situations.</p><p>The Gemini-powered platform can quickly pull up stats in response to questions like, "Who are the top five left-handed batters who played in this year's playoffs?" It can also handle follow-ups, such as "Now who was best in the ninth inning, and what about when the bases are loaded?"</p><p>These examples from Google demonstrate how Fox broadcasters are using Google AI to commentate during the biggest games in sports, like the World Series.</p><p>"It helps us spot the big stories — like who's heating up, who's struggling and which performances are shaping this postseason," said MLB player and Fox Sports analyst Alex Rodriguez in the blog post.</p><h2 id="other-ways-google-cloud-is-powering-mlb-broadcasts-2">Other ways Google Cloud is powering MLB broadcasts</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NrC6Bo4HMBSdf7qf7Qq52f" name="Google-cloud-mwc-sign-02.jpg" alt="Google Cloud at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrC6Bo4HMBSdf7qf7Qq52f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google also shared how MLB is using a Connectivity Agent, affectionately named "Connie," to monitor the status of connectivity and network feeds during broadcasts.

Currently, it's possible to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/switching-iphone-android">transfer some things across the two platforms</a>, but certain items like app data get left behind. Apple is working to change that with a new AppMigrationKit framework specifically designed to transfer app data between iOS and Android devices.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appmigrationkit" target="_blank">AppMigrationKit</a> is currently in beta, and it's being tested alongside the beta releases of iOS 26.1 and iPadOS 26.1. In rare fashion, the documentation for AppMigrationKit specifically states this framework is not intended for use within the Apple ecosystem:</p><div><blockquote><p>AppMigrationKit only supports migration to and from non-Apple platforms, such as Android. The system doesn’t use the framework for migration between iOS or iPadOS devices. The framework also has no functionality in iOS apps running in visionOS or in macOS on Apple silicon. The framework ignores calls from Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst.</p><p>Apple Developer</p></blockquote></div><p>The documentation specifically calls out Android, signaling that iOS devices will soon be able to transfer app data to and from the Google platform. Apple says developers can use the AppMigrationKit to "export your app’s on-device data to another device running a non-Apple platform, or to import from another platform, or both."</p><p>In other words, the migration process will be supercharged when setting up a new Android phone with an iPhone. It's already possible to transfer apps between iOS and Android while setting up a new device, but individual app data stored on-device is lost. When apps start supporting AppMigrationKit, and the features become publicly available, that will change.</p><p>Additionally, apps will be able to download data stored in the cloud automatically when the device-to-device migration finishes.</p><h2 id="apple-and-google-are-finally-building-better-migration-tools-2">Apple and Google are finally building better migration tools</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF" name="iPhone-Air-vs-S25-Edge" alt="The black iPhone Air beside the silver Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wm7aNCmHnjU5dTXH42XosF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AppMigrationKit could become publicly available as soon as the release of iOS 26.1.

It's OpenAI's latest foray into consumer apps, and claimed the number one spot on App Store charts for weeks. The social platform is designed around generating and sharing short videos created with AI, and it seems to be slowly-changing public perception of AI-generated content — from slop to social.</p><p>Now, OpenAI has confirmed that an Android app is officially on the Sora roadmap. "Finally, the Android version of Sora is actually coming soon," wrote Bill Peebles, who is OpenAI's head of Sora, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/billpeeb/status/1981118483607032050" target="_blank">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p><p>The upcoming Sora app for Android will join a slew of future features Peebles also teased in the post. Character cameos is arriving in "the coming days," and it'll let Sora users create AI-generated videos of their favorite pets or inanimate objects.</p><p>"We're expecting people to register lots of crazy new cameos with this feature," Peebles explained. "To make them easier to find, we're updating the generation UI to show the latest trending cameos in real time."</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">sora roadmap update: in the spirit of building this app openly, here's what we're landing soon.first, more creation tools. character cameos are coming in the next few days: you'll be able to cameo your dog, guinea pig, favorite stuffed toy, and pretty much anything else you… pic.twitter.com/GX7CJXWRcZ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1981118483607032050">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Cameos are a core feature of the Sora app — they're AI-generated videos created of yourself based on a sample video you upload for training. After providing Sora with a video of yourself, you can make AI videos of your lifelike doppelgänger doing basically anything. From there, these videos can be shared in a "For you" style social feed with others, much like TikTok or Instagram.</p><p>"We're working on making the social experience much better," Peebles wrote. "We are exploring new ways to use Sora with your friends (versus just a global feed) and broader community. Think channels that are specific to your university, company, sports club, etc."</p><p>Character cameos and improved social features will join basic video-editing tools, so users can stitch clips without leaving the Sora app. Currently, Sora is only available on the web and iOS, but these features will presumably arrive on the now-confirmed Android app.</p><h2 id="how-you-can-use-sora-on-android-today-2">How you can use Sora on Android today</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e17a5ac2-f1cd-4bf3-99e1-40cfe0b0d235" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Visit: Sora.com" data-dimension48="Visit: Sora.com" href="https://sora.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="DVYNN4W5Bjr5LAYFvjSm9V" name="Sora-OpenAI-App" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DVYNN4W5Bjr5LAYFvjSm9V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sora by OpenAI</strong></p><p>To add it to your home screen, <strong>visit the link below</strong>, tap the <strong>three-button menu</strong> in Chrome, press <strong>Add to home screen</strong>, and tap <strong>Install </strong>to finish.

I spend a lot of time at the gym, working out and lifting weights several times a week, but cardio and running are the bane of my existence. I never quite understood how and why anyone would enjoy running. Why subject yourself to that?</p><p>However, for the past couple of months, I’ve been using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and the Fitbit app to do just that. Despite my better judgment, I decided it’s time to change my routine, spending nearly every morning running to see how I can improve the duration and distance of my runs.</p><p>To do this, I’ve been utilizing the AI-powered daily run recommendations in the Fitbit app. I’ve been curious to see whether these recommendations are really helpful or if it’s just another glorified AI feature with no real rhyme or reason to its suggestions. Turns out, this could actually be a fantastic tool for beginners like me, making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-couch-5k-apps">couch-to-5K journey</a> a little less daunting.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

However, you can always change your preferences by tapping the <strong>See all</strong> button next to <strong>Today’s run</strong>, then tapping the three-dot menu in the top corner. Here, you can disable daily run workouts, adjust your running level or focus, and change your distance days to focus on longer runs.</p><h2 id="slow-and-steady-2">Slow and steady</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3051px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ihPZBDkzgHjys43hqiDF5P" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-and-Google-Pixel-Watch-3-1" alt="Holding the Garmin Forerunner 570 and Google Pixel Watch 3, both displaying workout modes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ihPZBDkzgHjys43hqiDF5P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3051" height="1716" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I was initially nervous about starting a running “plan.” <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">My previous experience with a Garmin plan</a> was a bit too intense for me, and I couldn’t keep up, so I went into this cautiously. It’s important to note that this isn’t a running “plan,” per se, so I couldn’t see ahead to what my runs would look like. The Fitbit app would take my previous workout data as well as my target load to surface a new recommendation for me each day.</p><p>While a viewable workout plan of some sort would be nice, what I like about this feature is that the workouts feel like they’re perfectly tailored to me and my capabilities. Going into this, I could only comfortably run about a mile before I would tire and have to stop. Therefore, based on what Fitbit knows about me and my goals, it was able to get me started with some very easy runs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="j43mKUx6LscgU5hwjpN4kP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Fitbit-AI-run-recommendations-6" alt="Easy run Fitbit recommendation on the Fitbit app and Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j43mKUx6LscgU5hwjpN4kP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These runs would vary each day, typically between an easy run and a tempo run, with the former keeping me at a relatively moderate heart rate and the latter pushing me into a more vigorous heart rate zone. The duration of the runs also varies, from shorter 18-minute runs to longer 40-minute runs.</p><p>That said, even the shorter runs challenged me, as I would previously average about 10 minutes before I called it quits. However, this was a very manageable challenge, as I had a target heart rate range that I would have to maintain. This helped me manage by breathing more effectively, while also reminding me that I do not have to run as fast as I can all the time; I can take my time at a steady pace to keep me going for a longer period of time.</p><p>Additionally, Fitbit would also mix things up so the intervals were always different from day to day. Sometimes it would have me do a single run for a certain period of time, or it would break up my run, starting me off slower and steadily pushing me to run faster, or having me maintain a faster pace but for short periods with even shorter rest periods between them. This helped me get used to pacing myself while helping me build my endurance and mileage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="JNF4zLbFF4npozGF5eeV8P" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Fitbit-AI-run-recommendations-5" alt="Fitbit Personalized workouts customization screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNF4zLbFF4npozGF5eeV8P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The best part is that you don’t have to follow each run exactly as it appears. There’s a Customize run button at the bottom of each recommendation, where you can remove warm-ups and cool-downs, delete or move intervals around, add intervals, and even edit the intensity of each interval. That said, I rarely found a need for this and just followed each recommendation as it was given to me.</p><p>As I noted before, when I first started this just a couple of months ago, I could barely run for more than one mile without tiring myself out. Now, I’m consistently and comfortably running two to three miles per day, and my pace has also improved to just under 12 minutes per mile.</p><p>Do I love running now? Definitely not. But I don't dislike it as much as I used to.</p><h2 id="where-google-can-improve-2">Where Google can improve</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4238px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jxKYajAHkkDsgoxuf87KBP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Fitbit-AI-run-recommendations-3" alt="Fitbit Exercise screen on the Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jxKYajAHkkDsgoxuf87KBP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4238" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While each recommended run explains why it will benefit you before you start it, I do wish there was some sort of built-in AI summary for post-run evaluations. You can view and compare charts as well as form analysis to gauge how efficient your running is, but having something to summarize the data in an easy-to-consume way would help me figure out where and how to improve.</p><p>You can always share the post-run data with Gemini, but the experience isn’t very seamless, and Gemini’s responses are a bit general.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3869px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ci8gArCgAX7MehSJdpxsH3" name="Garmin-Vivoactive-6-review-21" alt="The Garmin Vivoactive 6 next to the Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ci8gArCgAX7MehSJdpxsH3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3869" height="2176" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I also wish run suggestions would appear on the Pixel Watch. Right now, I can tap the <strong>Start run</strong> button in the Fitbit smartphone app, and it will send it to the Pixel Watch 3, where I can just tap the Start button. However, this is the extent of its presence on the watch, as AI run recommendations are not even viewable on the Fitbit Wear OS app.</p><p>This would be a perfect opportunity to enhance the Morning Brief feature, which feels pretty useless in its current form. Garmin watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-fitness-heart-rate-steps">Venu 4</a> include daily workout suggestions in the Morning Report, whether or not you have a plan in place, so it feels like a missed opportunity on the Pixel Watch.</p><h2 id="i-m-excited-about-what-s-to-come-2">I'm excited about what's to come</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Dkz2bJQ4gkYhyysyZhNHc" name="fitbit-ai-personal-coach" alt="New personal health coach by Fitbit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dkz2bJQ4gkYhyysyZhNHc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, running is just part of my daily routine now, as I also spend a lot of time weightlifting. However, Fitbit’s Coach tab simply surfaces various workouts I can do. While they are based on my daily readiness and workout preferences, it's simply a collection of video workouts I can follow, and there doesn’t seem to be much rhyme or reason to their recommendations.</p><p>This is why I’m excited for the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-adding-ai-powered-health-coach-fitbit-and-pixel-watch">Personal Health Coach</a>, which will use AI to provide more dynamic fitness recommendations.

It's not just about the silicon chips themselves, but about the network of energy, water, and resources required to power and sustain them all. Consider the following:</p><p><strong>AI is hungry:</strong> Training and operating advanced AI models, like the ubiquitous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-could-be-set-as-default-assistant">ChatGPT</a>, consumes <em>staggering</em> amounts of electricity. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/projecting-the-electricity-demand-growth-of-generative-ai-large-language-models-in-the-us/" target="_blank">Some projections</a> estimate that AI could account for up to 0.5% of global electricity consumption by 2027. This could even lead to the resurrection of dormant coal-fired power plants — an idea that sends shivers down the spines of anyone concerned about carbon emissions.</p><p><strong>Machines are thirsty:</strong> Data centers powering AI require <em>colossal</em> amounts of water for cooling. Google, for instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-water-use-soaring-ai-make-it-worse-data-centers-2023-7" target="_blank">consumed an astounding <em>21 billion liters</em> of water in 2022</a> alone. By 2027, this figure could balloon to six times Denmark's <em><strong>entire</strong></em> annual water usage.</p><p><strong>A mountain of e-waste:</strong> The demand for newer, more powerful hardware creates a mountain of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-lg-sues-indian-government-e-waste-floor-pricing">electronic waste</a>. This toxic heap, laden with hazardous materials and rare-earth elements, is projected to reach millions of tons by 2030, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://earth.org/e-waste-recycling-rates-remain-dangerously-low-as-demand-for-electronic-devices-booms-un-report-reveals/" target="_blank">less than a quarter recycled properly</a>.</p><h2 id="green-computing-is-now-a-necessity-2">"Green Computing" is now a necessity</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="copXgLxaQ9bdHziamBhViS" name="nothing-phone-2-environmental-efforts.jpg" alt="Nothing details the amount of recycled material within the Phone (2)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/copXgLxaQ9bdHziamBhViS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twitter)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The concept of "green computing" has undergone a remarkable transformation over the decades. Before the turn of the century, the environmental impact of computing was mostly an afterthought, and "Green IT" was just a whisper, if it was even mentioned at all.</p><p>The 21st century changed everything, driven by the exponential growth of data centers. As facilities consumed more energy, concerns about their environmental footprint grew. Initiatives like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Savers_Computing_Initiative" target="_blank">Climate Savers Computing Initiative</a> emerged, seeking to promote greater energy efficiency.</p><p>However, introducing "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-omnibox-address-bar-gains-machine-learning">deep learning</a>" and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gcd-2024-google-ai-tested-llm-chatbots-with-werewolf">large language models</a> (LLMs) in the 2010s ushered in a new era. The sheer scale of computation required to train and deploy these AI models transformed AI's environmental impact from a concern to a crisis. The rise of "Green AI" reflects growing recognition that we must develop and deploy AI more sustainably.</p><h2 id="google-s-big-response-2">Google's big response</h2><div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/Data_Centers__CSS_Multimedia_v09.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/Data_Centers__CSS_Multimedia_v09.mp4"></video></div><p>Under growing scrutiny, tech giants have launched public relations campaigns touting their commitment to sustainability. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sustainability.google/reports/247-carbon-free-energy/">Google has pledged to achieve 24/7 carbon-free energy</a> and replenish more water than it consumes. But are these promises more than just greenwashing?</p><p>Google has even developed a methodology for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/measuring_the_environmental_impact_of_delivering_ai_at_google_scale.pdf" target="_blank">quantifying AI's environmental impact</a>, claiming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-breaks-down-geminis-daily-limits-for-prompts-and-image-creation">a Gemini prompt</a> consumes a mere 0.24 Wh of energy and produces 0.03 gCO2e. But are these numbers telling the whole story?</p><p>Despite its efficiency gains, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/12/g-s1-9545/ai-brings-soaring-emissions-for-google-and-microsoft-a-major-contributor-to-climate-change" target="_blank">Google's emissions have increased by a staggering 48% since 2019</a>, largely due to its investments in AI. This glaring contradiction certainly casts a shadow on the company's ambitious net-zero goal by 2030.</p><p>To address this, Google has launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/first-carbon-capture-storage-project/" target="_blank">first major carbon capture initiative</a>, aiming to capture 90% of CO2 emissions from a natural gas power plant and store it underground. Google touts this as a "reliable, low-carbon power source" for its data centers, particularly in regions where renewable energy sources are not always readily available.</p><p>But is this a genuine step towards a sustainable future, or simply a clever ploy to maintain its energy-hungry AI operations under a disguise of environmental responsibility?</p><h2 id="the-challenges-of-ccs-2">The challenges of CCS</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uSc9VxALdcwXQL7vDUnLic" name="lake-scene" alt="A still mountain lake" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uSc9VxALdcwXQL7vDUnLic.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3984" height="2241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand/Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology holds the promise of removing emissions from industries that are difficult to decarbonize, potentially playing a crucial role in achieving net-zero goals. Proponents point to advancements in Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Bio-Energy with CCS (BECCS) as evidence of CCS's potential.</p><p>However, CCS faces deserved criticism. Detractors argue that it is expensive, slow to scale, and energy-intensive. The current deployment of CCS technology lags far behind the levels needed to make a significant impact. Some critics also argue that CCS allows fossil fuel industries to continue operating, delaying the transition to renewable energy sources.</p><p>Public skepticism also poses a challenge. Concerns about the safety of CCS, the long-term storage of captured carbon, and the potential local environmental impacts (as demonstrated by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/01/uruguay-anger-environmental-cost-google-datacentre-carbon-emissions-toxic-waste-water" target="_blank">protests against Google's data center in Uruguay</a>) have fueled opposition to CCS projects.</p><p>The controversy is further exacerbated by tech companies' lack of transparency about the true environmental costs of AI. Without reliable data, it is difficult to determine the true impact of these technologies and hold companies accountable for their environmental performance.</p><h2 id="the-balancing-act-2">The balancing act</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tSX8PCRhqmicp6VXHdA92e" name="Galaxy-S25-On-Device-AI-2" alt="The option for processing all data on-device." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tSX8PCRhqmicp6VXHdA92e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The future of AI, and maybe the planet, hangs in the balance.

In response to Nothing's $10 million claim to develop such tech, the WPC stated the following to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/oPAcUyprayM?t=245">YouTuber TechAltar</a>: "If Nothing was a WPC member, they would have access to the specs and favorable licensing terms under RAND."</p><p>It adds, "Knowing that Google, HMD, Samsung (plus others soon) already are using the magnets in phones or covers suggests that Nothing may not understand the situation."</p><p>The host of the channel, Marton Barcza, states Nothing likes to upload playful videos about "hypothetical devices" and the purported "cost" it would take to make those real. It was during one of those videos that Nothing said it would cost an unimaginable amount of money to develop the magnetic wireless charging system. The company adds that while "the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's MagSafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat."</p><p>Nothing claimed that "a lot of companies" have probably weighed this risk, coupled with the supposed cost demand, and have settled for wired charging, which is faster.</p><h2 id="qi2-s-not-out-of-the-question-2">Qi2's not out of the question</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2G6RZi2Q4WRsUHjcFvJQjb" name="Nothing Qi2 battery pack concept, Battery (1), render" alt="Nothing Qi2 battery pack concept, Battery (1), render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2G6RZi2Q4WRsUHjcFvJQjb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 3DPrintedCat / Nothing Community)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Barcza said that they went into research, meeting with industry experts and even the WPC about Qi2 and Nothing, but didn't hear anything like the comments made. It's assumed that there's just some miscommunication, but Barcza states that the magnetic alignment is "a part of the standard." This essentially means that companies wouldn't have to "recreate" anything if they want to implement it into their devices for wireless charging.</p><p>We've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothings-take-on-qi2">been excited and interested</a> in Nothing developing proper Qi2-capable devices and the accessories for it, but nothing's (no pun intended) happened yet. The Phone 3a and 3a Pro debuted without Qi2 support, much like the Nothing Phone 3, which lacks the newer alignment to support it, as well.</p><p>When we get down to the WPC's comments, Google and Samsung both feature Qi2, just in different ways—and varying support. Google's recent Pixel 10 series features full Qi2 support, meaning everything is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">integrated within the phones</a> themselves. However, when you get to Samsung's Galaxy S25 series, consumers will need a case to take advantage of the Qi2 support, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">as the phones don't feature it natively</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung now appears to have released another internal build of One UI 8.5 for the Galaxy S25, introducing some new features we're seeing for the first time.</p><p>According to reliable Samsung leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1981397966331269233">Tarun Vats</a>, the company has started internal testing for One UI 8.5. The new version carries the build number "YJH" and includes the October 2025 patch. The update is reportedly around 2GB in size, and while it remains only for internal testing, tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1981643152789217382">Max Jambor</a> gained access to it, revealing several features planned for the next major update.</p><p>Samsung has long been working on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-8-5-get-to-the-point-faster-ai-notification-summaries">AI-based notification summaries</a> feature for One UI. The feature, as the name suggests, would allow users to summarize "long messages" and show a brief preview in the notification panel. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheBrackard/status/1981670958810517540">spotted</a> by a user on X, the new One UI 8.5 build now adds this option in the settings menu.</p><h2 id="ai-summaries-and-priority-alerts-spotted-in-one-ui-8-5-2">AI summaries and priority alerts spotted in One UI 8.5</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xiHy9cTAzoy4K68pLbkuyB" name="one-ui-8-5-notification-summary" alt="One UI 8.5 running on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xiHy9cTAzoy4K68pLbkuyB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Max Jambor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The settings text reads, "Show a short summary for conversational notifications in English and Korean." It seems the feature will initially support only these two languages and work for conversation-related notifications. As per the text in the Settings, users will also be able to choose which apps show summarized notifications in app's settings.</p><p>The new One UI 8.5 build also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/maxjmb/status/1981699715961086290">adds a priority notifications</a> feature, which places important alerts at the top so you don't miss them. Similar to AI-base notification summaries, you will be able to set priorities within app notification settings.</p><p>Additionally, Tarun Vats <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1981615354750308623">revealed</a> that the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-already-chasing-one-ui-8-5-new-leak-spots-galaxy-s25-test">One UI 8.5</a> version has reduced or nearly removed the 3D look from icons.</p><p>Samsung hasn't yet begun public testing for One UI 8.5, but a beta release is expected soon.

Well, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagram-map-snapchat-vibes-repost-debuts-reels-posts-update">Instagram</a> is finally coming to the rescue as the company has announced it is adding a watch history section.</p><p>Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, took to the company's X-rival Threads to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@mosseri">announce</a> that Instagram is finally adding a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-watch-history-home-feed-changes">YouTube-like Watch History</a> feature for Reels. This section will display all the Reels you've watched through your account, making it easier to find that specific Reel you're looking for.</p><p>According to Mosseri, this section will allow you to sort Reels by date watched (oldest to newest or newest to oldest) or narrow it down to a specific date or range of dates. Mosseri also added that Instagram will let you filter watch history by the account that posted that Reel.</p><h2 id="finding-that-lost-reel-on-instagram-just-got-easier-2">Finding that lost Reel on Instagram just got easier</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EQha9jvBtrDAaXzLQGHGrP" name="instagram-reels-watch-history" alt="Watch history feature in Instagram" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EQha9jvBtrDAaXzLQGHGrP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Watch History feature will be available similarly to how you can see your likes and comments by going to your profile tab > tapping the three-line menu in the top-right corner > selecting <strong>Settings > Your activity > Watch history</strong>.</p><p>I can already see the new section live in the latest version of the Instagram app on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 10 Pro</a>, so it seems the feature is rolling out widely.</p><p>In theory, the feature sounds quite useful as it will finally allow users to go back and find videos they had watched or scrolled past accidentally. It will also prevent users from relying on other techniques like liking Reels to save them for later or sending Reels to themselves to find again.</p><p>However, someone who watches a lot of Reels every day might find this feature less useful, as finding older ones might still be tricky, as they get buried in a long list. Still, it's a welcome and much-needed addition.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Onyx Boox Palma</a> made a name for itself by being the first major phone-sized E Ink device, and now the second follow-up is flipping the script by adding a layer of color to that E Ink screen.</p><p>Powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/bigme-b1051c-pro-color-e-ink-tablet-impressions">the same Kaleido 3 E color Ink display</a> as many popular e-readers launched in 2025, the Boox Palma 2 Pro's phone-like form factor makes it the most portable color e-reader you can find. It weighs just 173g (that's quite a bit lighter than your average smartphone these days), yet the 6.13-inch display is big enough to comfortably read from.</p><p>The dual-tone frontlight makes it easy to adjust the color temperature throughout the day, and Boox's fast refresh technology plus the Android 15-powered OS means normal Android apps work perfectly. It also sports 5G connectivity, so you can pop a SIM card in and have a data connection wherever you're at — just be aware that it doesn't function like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-e-ink-android-phone-is-the-kindle-phone-ive-always-wanted">an E Ink phone</a>.</p><p>Impressively enough, the Palma 2 Pro also supports the InkSense Plus stylus for highlighting and quick notes, and the SIM tray doubles as a microSD card reader for expandable storage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V5eCferdEuLFjMCB7kcrCT" name="onyx-boox-note-air-5-c-official-lifestyle-black" alt="The black Onyx Boox Note Air 5 C on a white table with its stylus on top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V5eCferdEuLFjMCB7kcrCT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Onyx)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The second announcement comes in the form of a proper E Ink tablet called the Note Air 5 C.

Aside from a big upgrade to Android 15 (the Air 4 C launched with Android 13 earlier this year), the Air 5 C has a better keyboard case that attaches with handy magnetic POGO pins.</p><p>The writing experience has been upgraded as well, with a more textured surface that feels "more paperlike," according to Onyx, as well as an improved Pen3 stylus. The Boox Note Air 5 C also "mind mapping and AI-powered Smart Scribe tools" to make note-taking and organization easier. Essentially, Boox is framing this as the ultimate E Ink day planner tablet.</p><p>Both of the new Boox products can be purchased today at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/">official Boox Shop page</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This test is for the company's major Android 16 update headed for several of its devices. Today (Oct 24), Phone 3a and 3a Pro users will experience Nothing's UI visual overhaul. This change regards the icons users will see across their devices, as Nothing states has been refreshed to feel "lighter" and "more refined."</p><p>These changes aren't set in stone, as Nothing will use the Open Beta to gauge user feedback and make any necessary changes.</p><p>The other major feature rolling out with the Open Beta is "Lock Glimpse." With Lock Glimpse, Nothing says users will find "high-quality wallpapers to your lock screen, curated to your taste across nine categories." This feature in the beta is disabled by default; however, diving into Settings will let you quickly enable it. Once there, users can decide to toggle "Display on lock screen," a feature that will refresh your lock screen with a new, curated wallpaper every time you turn on your screen.</p><p>Users can also toggle "Left swipe to explore." If enabled, swiping left on your lock screen will surface a new "captivating" piece of lock screen content for you. Nothing states it has plans in the works to let users lean on their personal photos for Lock Glimpse. It also states that your privacy will be taken into account if you choose your own content over Lock Glimpse's curated assortment.</p><h2 id="phone-3a-gets-in-the-beta-2">Phone 3a gets in the beta</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="2KG7KRdoiJHD54XPjCQWJ4" name="nothing-phone-3a-series-open-beta-android-16" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a series enters the Android 16 Open Beta." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2KG7KRdoiJHD54XPjCQWJ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The final new feature in the Open Beta concerns the Phone 3a series' camera. The patch notes state that a preset, created in collaboration with photographer Jordan Hemingway, lets users "enhance photos" with deep shadows and extended highlights. This photo preset should bring about a new "cinematic" photo by the end.</p><p>If you're interested in joining the beta, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/45141-nothing-os-40-phone-3a-series-open-beta#:~:text=shortly%20after%20installation.-,How%20to%20join,-Make%20sure%20your">there are a set of crucial steps</a> you must take to get going.

The company has now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3871046669/Q9vvtEyI2" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> will launch in China on October 27. While we don't know when it will be released globally, several rumors suggest it could happen on November 13 this year, just two weeks after the China launch.</p><p>Additionally, the OnePlus Ace 6 will debut alongside it and is expected to launch globally as the OnePlus 15R. As for the flagship's specs, we know so far that it will feature a whopping 165Hz refresh rate, come in three colorways, and be powered by the latest and greatest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> chipset.</p><p>A recent rumor also indicated that the OnePlus 15 won't have a 2K display, with the phone instead switching to 1.5K resolution, which is a slight downgrade, but it could show up with thinner bezels.</p><h2 id="google-snuck-in-the-report-button-for-android-auto-2">Google snuck in the 'report' button for Android Auto</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4oTzHXaHGG4hWwCbg9YYKA" name="Android-Auto-Gemini-Messages" alt="Sending a message using Gemini on Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4oTzHXaHGG4hWwCbg9YYKA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/drivers-spot-an-android-auto-update-that-makes-it-easier-to-stay-informed"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Some Android Auto users took to a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1o8ipxg/report_option_now_available_on_smaller_screens/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"> subreddit</a> to chat about the recent Google Maps update.

Users will find this option inside the app's settings. Additionally,  Android Auto's "suggested destinations" menu no longer expands when turned on for the first time. The user states, "The suggested destinations drop-down menu didn't expand, and when I tapped on it, it opened into the full-screen search/suggested destinations list."

Samsung usually launches its flagship devices roughly in the second or third week of January; we don't know what led the tipster to note that the launch has been pushed.</p><p>However, another leaker, Instant Digital, also shared news of the rumored Galaxy S26 delay <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5224475520925890" target="_blank">on Weibo</a> (translated). They stated the delay could be because the company wants to "present it better to everyone, the release of the Galaxy S26 series may be postponed to March for release."</p><p>If these two leakers' claims about a Galaxy S26 delay pan out, we could be looking at a February 2026 or March 2026 launch, which is highly unusual for Samsung.

In a blog post, the company said that these glasses are designed to support delivery associates to make deliveries "safer and more seamless."

They, however, differ from consumer-centric smart glasses and feature a fixed green monochrome heads-up display that shows the package details to the delivery associate within their field of view.</p><p>However, the glasses come with a small controller worn in the delivery vest and powered by a swappable battery for "all-day use." Amazon also says the glasses support prescription lenses and can automatically adjust to any light conditions.</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

For instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon is currently offering a free Samsung Galaxy S25 when you add a line with select new plans</strong></a>, representing about $800 in value.</p><p>We like the S25 for its small form factor, slim bezels, and the same powerful performance that comes with the rest of the Samsung Galaxy premium lineup. It also boasts a number of the latest Galaxy AI and Gemini features, and a fingerprint sensor.</p><p>This particular deal is for the 128GB version of the S25, though Verizon will also let you upgrade to the 256GB for just $1.66 a month as part of the deal. You can also get the deals in all four of the S25's colors: Icy Blue, Navy, Silver Shadow, and Mint.</p><p>If the S25 isn't quite what you're looking for, buyers can also upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus/" target="_blank"><strong>Galaxy S25 Plus if they go with an Unlimited Ultimate plan</strong></a>, or Verizon is still offering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/verizon-is-offering-a-free-google-pixel-10-pro-when-you-open-a-new-line-no-trade-in-required"><strong>free Google Pixel 10 Pro deal</strong></a> we reported on last week.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="s9GUjxWjwvBNCNBC552HKi" name="Samsung Galaxy S25" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s9GUjxWjwvBNCNBC552HKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 (128GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$799.99</del> <strong>$0.00/month for 36 months with select plans</strong></a></p><p>Verizon's latest free phone deal is for the Samsung Galaxy S25, which is our top pick in the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-small-phone">best small Android phone </a>category. Normally priced at $800, the S25 offers a compact build without compromising on performance, though the sticker price is usually a bit on the expensive side. As such, those who are willing to start a new line with Verizon might want to consider this deal.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a free Android phone and would be willing to add a line to their Verizon plan, or switch to the carrier; you like a phone that's more compact but still has a good-looking display; you're looking for a phone with industry-leading performance speeds and a range of Galaxy AI and Gemini features.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you prefer a phone with a longer lasting battery than the S25 can offer with its 4,000mAh battery; you'd rather upgrade to a larger phone like the S25 Plus; you need something with fast charging.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 </a>is our favorite small Android phone of the bunch, offering a vibrant 6.2-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, as well as the smooth Android 15-based One UI 7. This deal is for the 128GB storage option, though the phone is also available in an upgraded 256GB configuration.</p><p>Performance on the S25 is supported by the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor and 12GB or RAM.</p><p>Perhaps one of the largest downsides to the S25 is the limited 4,000mAh battery life, though it's still enough to get most casual users through the day without needing to charge. It also sports 25W wired fast charging and 15W wireless charging, though these aren't the fastest speeds on the market.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If an agreement isn't reached, the platform states content from Disney, including ABC and ESPN, will vanish from its consumers' reach. Officially, YouTube states, "We've been working in good faith to negotiate a deal with Disney that pays them fairly for their content on YouTube TV."</p><p>Where things evolve is where the service adds, "Unfortunately, Disney is proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers and give our customers fewer choices, while benefiting Disney’s own live TV products - like Hulu + Live TV and, soon, Fubo."</p><p>On the other side, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/disney-espn-youtube-tv-network-dispute.html">CNBC</a> reports that Disney has issued its own statement regarding the negotiations, as well as a new "public message" run, informing YouTube TV users about the ongoing process (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/24/youtube-tv-disney-channels-espn-abc-warning/">9to5Google</a>). A Disney spokesperson informed the publication that, "This is the latest example of Google exploiting its position at the expense of their own customers." It mentions that more than shows will disappear, as the NFL, NHL, College Football, and more will go alongside it.</p><p>We've entered crunch time, as YouTube TV and Disney have until October 30 at 11:59 pm ET to reach an agreement. If nothing is achieved, Disney's content will disappear. YouTube adds that <em>if </em>Disney's content is removed, and if it remains gone for an "extended period of time," it will grant subscribers $20 in credit.</p><h2 id="tense-situation-2">Tense Situation</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:999px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="zntMZ2xXoFHNXBCM5MTVuG" name="YouTube-TV-5-million.jpg" alt="YouTube TV hits 5 million subscribers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zntMZ2xXoFHNXBCM5MTVuG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="999" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube TV's been involved in some tense, down-to-the-wire negotiations to keep content on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv-nbcuniversal-dispute">platform before with NBCUniversal</a>. In 2021, there was the threat of viewers losing roughly 14 channels of NBCUniversal's content during the agreement renewal process with YouTube TV. These two got into negotiations again just recently, as CNBC reports, which wrapped up positively in September.</p><p>In February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/paramount-and-youtube-tv-finalize-deal-keeping-cbs-cbs-sports-available">YouTube TV and Paramount</a> had to hash out a new agreement to keep CBS and CBS Sports on the air for subscribers. This negotiation was a bit larger, as 30 channels were on the hook if this fell through.</p><p>This was essentially as public a struggle as we're seeing today with Disney. It was reported that YouTube TV and Paramount found difficulties in achieving a "fair deal." Things resulted well (in a way), as the two reached an agreement to keep the channels available for subscribers.

If you'd prefer to activate it yourself, you can still save $350, and either way, it's a good price on our favorite premium Android phone and a performance powerhouse.</p><p>The S25 Ultra features the Samsung S Pen stylus, as well as a large, 6.9-inch AMOLED display, a 5,000mAh battery, and a powerful set of cameras that users love. It also comes with Samsung's latest Galaxy AI features, and a software update promise of seven years, much to the light of those who like to future-proof their devices. While this particular deal is for the 256GB version of the device, Best Buy is also offering a discount on the upgraded 512GB configuration for those who have a little more money to spend.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,299.99" data-dimension48="$1,299.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-256gb-unlocked-titanium-black/J3ZYG25JP5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="5EmxECcxriWXSWxeJa9eua" name="samsung galaxy s25 ultra 400x500 render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5EmxECcxriWXSWxeJa9eua.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (256GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-256gb-unlocked-titanium-black/J3ZYG25JP5" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,299.99" data-dimension48="$1,299.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,299.99</del> <strong>as low as $849.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Our favorite premium Android phone is still available for up to $450 off during Best Buy's outlet sale, which runs through this weekend.

The rear cameras include a 50MP telephoto lens, a 10MP telephoto lens, a 50MP ultrawide lens, and a 200MP wide lens. On the front, the S25 Ultra sports a 12MP wide lens.</p><p>The S25 Ultra also comes with the S Pen stylus, along with 12GB of RAM, and, for this particular version, 256GB of storage—though users can also upgrade to 512GB, if that isn't enough.</p><p>It's worth noting that, for those who need a wide range of PWM settings, the S25 series is probably not the way to go, as none of them include flicker-reduction options. It's also still fairly expensive, even with the price cut, though buyers who have had their eyes on this model may want to consider picking it up while it's under $1,000.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But there's a huge barrier to entry that's going to require a lot of convincing for people to accept it: the price. At $1,799, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Samsung Galaxy XR</a> is expensive, no matter how you frame the argument.</p><p>On the bright side, it's half the price of the Apple Vision Pro while retaining many of that headset's best features, including a cutting-edge micro-OLED display, eye-tracking capabilities with iris biometric authentication, and more.</p><p>But at 3x the cost of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, is it really possible to justify the cost of Samsung's headset over Meta's?

Say you get home from work, have a nice dinner with your family, and then are ready to sit on the couch for some much-earned relaxing time... but your kids want to watch KPop Demon Hunters for the 346th time. No shade on KPop, but sometimes you need a break from the same old thing.</p><p>That's where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Galaxy XR</a> comes in. Pop this sweet headset on and you're instantly transported to the entertainment and relaxation <em>you</em> want, without having to fight over who is using the TV tonight.</p><p>It's your own TV, and you can do whatever the heck you want with it, even play those mature-rated games or watch HBO shows without your kids having to see or hear it before they're ready.</p><h2 id="better-for-work-2">Better for work</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-floating-windows-chrome-official" alt="Three floating windows in an Android XR mixed reality environment with Chrome in the middle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've used a lot of smart glasses over the years, and while some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> offer incredible ways to give yourself a personal theater (see the above section), their field of view is limited.</p><p>Take <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a>, for instance. The screens in those glasses offer a 50-degree FoV, while Xreal One Pro ups that to 57 degrees. That's impressive for smart glasses, but the Samsung Galaxy XR offers a 109-degree FoV. That's <em>double</em> the field of view, and it means your workspace looks like real life through the Galaxy XR's lenses rather than through a small window.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="b25Ee4cvFzaByJVywx5Kbf" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-workspace-official" alt="A man wearing a Samsung Galaxy XR interacting with floating windows using his hands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b25Ee4cvFzaByJVywx5Kbf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="676" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When you're using apps or working with your headset on, this wider field of view truly matters. The experience feels like you're sitting at a desk with monitors that you can move around at will, kind of like Tom Cruise in Minority Report. The difference here is that your windows aren't restricted to a 2D plane; you can move them <em>anywhere</em> you want in space.</p><p>Not to mention the fact that Android XR supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-secret-sauce-behind-samsungs-galaxy-xr-headset">every single Android app</a> on the Google Play Store, so you're not going to be worried about missing that important app you use every day.

Ironically, the optional Galaxy XR controllers are now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/high-demand-wipes-out-galaxy-xr-controllers-hours-after-launch">backordered into December</a> because owners clearly want to game on this thing.</p><p>And why not? Android XR supports the OpenXR standard, which means developers can port their existing Meta Quest games to Galaxy XR with relatively little work if they use the OpenXR API. But don't just take my word for it, here's what the developers of Walkabout Mini Golf had to say:</p><p>"Android XR was a medium difficulty port, mainly because the game was written before things like OpenXR was well supported, so there were a few systems that had to be replaced with newer standards. It's good housekeeping for a game like ours to keep our tech stack up to date and ports like this are part of that practice.” — Lucas Martell, CEO of Mighty Coconut</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioCCn_qrbuo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Gaming on a Galaxy XR isn't just about native VR games. You can play <em>any</em> Android game on Galaxy XR on a giant, resizable screen, so no more squinting down at your phone trying to read the text in Stardew Valley or trying to snipe across the map in Fortnite.</p><p>And Galaxy XR's incredible eye, hand, and face tracking technology all transfer to your PC when you use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=virtualdesktop.android">Virtual Desktop app</a> from the Google Play Store.

They're not small and portable like a phone, and the UI and lack of built-in physical keyboard make them difficult to recommend as a laptop replacement.</p><p>But last year, when my power was out for two weeks after Hurricane Helene, I found that the Honor MagicPad 2 tablet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/these-gadgets-got-me-through-the-worst-hurricane-of-my-life">was the perfect replacement</a> for my laptop because of the battery life. This year, Honor is taking that usage to heart, upgrading the MagicPad 3 with a giant 13.3-inch screen that rivals the best laptops.</p><p>This large size and included stylus also make it perfect for artists who want a digital canvas without investing $1,200 in a similarly sized iPad Pro. But the tablet's massive size makes it awkward for most other tasks, limiting its general-use potential. Over the past few weeks, I've been putting this tablet to the test in every way I can find, and I've narrowed its usefulness down to three categories.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

While Android as a laptop OS still has awkward limitations compared to Windows, Honor's MagicOS skin feels more like a laptop OS than ever.</p><p>That starts with a new default window-management function that launches everything in resizable windows rather than full-screen monstrosities. Pair this with the ability to minimize windows to floating icons that can be moved anywhere on the screen, plus a quick way to launch several apps in four pre-made split-screen templates, and it's easy to see why this feels more like a desktop OS than ever.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div

The tablet now magnetically adheres to the case and is far simpler to remove and place into the case than before. The keyboard has an extremely comfortable layout that felt native to me the second I started typing on it.</p><p>Unlike some other tablet keyboards I've used, there was no adjustment period for me using it. It felt almost identical to my Honor MagicBook Art 14 laptop, which was refreshing. Even the trackpad mouse is fantastic and feels like a proper laptop mouse. My one critique is that the taskbar <em>still</em> cannot be pinned. This was a huge oversight last year, and I really hope Honor adds it in the MagicOS 10 update.</p><h2 id="multimedia-powerhouse-2">Multimedia powerhouse</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Wz8dbeG2hjXxN2ZXzjF2ag" name="honor-magicpad-3-stylus-games" alt="Playing Gorogoa on an Honor MagicPad 3 using the included stylus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wz8dbeG2hjXxN2ZXzjF2ag.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Last year's Honor MagicPad 2's speakers were incredible and made watching downloaded videos and movies in the dark evenings (without power) after the Hurricane a joy.</p><p>This year's speakers are somehow even better, offering incredibly full sound, notable bass, and truly impressive virtual surround sound.

Doesn't make much sense to have a flicker-free backlight and get lots of TÜV Rheinland eyecare certifications if your pixels are just going to end up flickering a bunch of colors, now does it?</p><h2 id="a-stylus-if-that-s-your-thing-2">A stylus, if that's your thing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eoT5hqTqXdmzGSMhcDaf25" name="honor-magicpad-3-magicpad-2-size-comparison" alt="Comparing the size of the Honor MagicPad 3 (left) with the Honor MagicPad 2 (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eoT5hqTqXdmzGSMhcDaf25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Comparing the size of the Honor MagicPad 3 (left) with the Honor MagicPad 2 (right) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A third reason to buy this tablet would be the excellent stylus that comes with it, but I'm not sure how many professional artists use a tablet to make their art. It could also be excellent for anyone who just loves to draw or doodle — adults and kids alike — as the canvas is so massive and lies nicely and flat on a table, especially if it's in a case.</p><p>That said, I think sticking with something smaller makes sense for most people. There's certainly room for big tablets in the world (see what I did there?), but I've not found many in my own time with the MagicPad 3. I think the MagicPad 2 is still the better buy because of its size and display, both of which you won't be disappointed in.</p> ]]></dc:content>

T-Mobile is officially closing the popular loophole, and the change is effective starting October 24, 2025.</p><p>T-Mobile has officially ended a long-standing workaround that allowed some customers to score the $5 per-line AutoPay discount while still paying their bills with a credit card. As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tmo.report/2025/10/t-mobile-ends-credit-card-autopay-loophole/" target="_blank">The Mobile Report</a>, users who prepay their bills using ineligible payment methods will lose their AutoPay discount for that billing cycle.</p><p>The change puts an end to a payment workaround that many savvy subscribers had been using to enjoy both T-Mobile’s monthly discount and credit card perks like cash back or travel points.</p><p>Previously, customers could set up AutoPay with a debit card or bank account to qualify for the discount, but then pay their bill early with a credit card. The system would still show an eligible payment method and apply the discount, even though the actual payment did not qualify.</p><h2 id="t-mobile-s-system-now-catches-you-2">T-Mobile's system now catches you</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1990px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T" name="T-Mobile-Store.jpeg" alt="T-Mobile store sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1990" height="1119" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>T-Mobile is now tightening its billing logic to ensure the discount only applies when the actual payment is made with an approved method. The company says customers who prepay their bill partially or in full using a credit card or another unsupported option will automatically forfeit the discount for that month.</p><p>The policy has been in place since 2023 when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-t-mobile-phones">T-Mobile</a> officially excluded credit cards from AutoPay eligibility, but this recent update closes the technical gap that made the loophole possible. Affected customers will start receiving text notifications informing them that their AutoPay discount has been removed for the upcoming billing cycle.</p><p>To keep getting the $5 per-line discount, customers must use a debit card or bank account as their payment method and avoid making early payments with a credit card. If you prefer paying with a credit card for the rewards, you’ll need to decide whether those perks are worth giving up the recurring discount.</p><p>For families or multi-line plans, losing that $5 per line can quickly add up, potentially costing an extra $20 or more each month, depending on the number of lines on the account, as pointed out by one subscriber on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1oebrsa/comment/nl14pdh/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>.</p><p>For now, there’s no indication that T-Mobile plans to extend credit card eligibility again, so if you want to keep saving on your bill, sticking with a debit card or bank account is the only way to go.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I've used several cameras over the years, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/this-dongle-sized-thermal-camera-is-astonishingly-good">Thermal Master's P2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/this-fluke-dongle-brings-a-thermal-camera-to-your-android-phone">Fluke iSee</a>. The latter is interesting because it's made by a brand that's known for its industrial tools, and in did a good job in my usage.</p><p>Not to be outdone, Thermal Master rolled out the P3, which is arguably the best thermal camera dongle you can get today. The dongle connects over USB-C, and I didn't have any issues using it with my Galaxy Z Fold 7 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>. The P3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-Master-P3-Imaging-Camera/dp/B0FF4YFCS9">retails for $299 on Amazon</a>, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thermalmaster.com/products/thermal-master-p3-pcb-master">costs the same on the brand's website</a>. If you're buying via Thermal Master's site, you get an additional 10% off by using code <strong>Android10</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KQ9SLffcmPKq3CbgSiEzsS" name="Thermal Master P3" alt="Thermal Master P3 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KQ9SLffcmPKq3CbgSiEzsS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The P3 is considerably bigger than its predecessor, but even then, it weighs just 26g, and is easily portable anywhere.

You also get a wider range of color palettes, and you get manual focus as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PX7L8RojafBoykbG7xH5FT" name="Thermal Master P3" alt="Thermal Master P3 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PX7L8RojafBoykbG7xH5FT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The camera is useful if you need to identify hotspots, or in my case, see just how hot a phone gets while running a game, and where that heat is going.

The most noticeable change is the new icons, which are now bigger and more rounded. This gives the app a fresher look that matches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Google's current style</a>.</p><p>Inside the video player, the differences are more noticeable. The landscape mode button is now encased in a circle and slightly larger, making it easier to spot. The dimmed background when pausing a video has been removed, letting thumbnails and details remain visible.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="LMuaMq7a3BnbzTtnaK29mi" name="YouTube-player-redesign-Android" alt="YouTube video player with enhanced buttons and icons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LMuaMq7a3BnbzTtnaK29mi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="406" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube also fine-tuned the skip-forward and rewind animations to be less jarring, so skipping ahead doesn’t interrupt the flow of what you’re watching.</p><h2 id="landscape-mode-is-finally-clean-2">Landscape mode is finally clean</h2><p>Landscape mode now looks much cleaner. All the main controls like thumbs up, thumbs down, comments, save, and share are grouped together in a pill-shaped container in the bottom-left corner.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2316px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.63%;"><img id="ABCe5ZEEgg8fHY6TPopyq6" name="YouTube-player-landscape-mode" alt="Youtube player in landscape mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ABCe5ZEEgg8fHY6TPopyq6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2316" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the more playful additions is the dynamic “like” animation. When you hit the thumbs-up button, you’ll now see themed animations depending on the video type, like floating music notes for songs. It’s a small but clever way to make engagement a bit more fun.</p><p>YouTube is also fixing a common complaint about the comment section. It now has a proper threaded design, making it much easier to follow conversations and see who is replying to whom. This update helps organize what was once a confusing area.</p><p>The rollout is already underway globally for Android and iOS, though not everyone will see it right away. If the redesign hasn’t reached your device yet, relaunching the app might help trigger it.</p><p>Google is describing this as YouTube’s biggest UI refresh in years. The new player interface is designed to be less intrusive, obscuring as little of the video as possible.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> users on Reddit have reported seeing a mysterious question mark(?) instead of the percentage.</p><p>This issue seems to be cropping up for users who have wireless chargers, particularly third-party or non-Qi2 certified chargers, but this is still speculation(as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/10/23/some-pixel-10-pro-fold-users-are-seeing-a-question-mark-on-the-battery-icon/">Piunika Web</a>). The rumor on the street is that these chargers might've caused a "brief communication or calibration error between the battery management system and the software interface, resulting in the phone being unsure of the current battery level, hence the question mark," the publication added.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelFold/comments/1oatwxb/well_this_is_new_question_mark_next_to_battery">Well this is new...

Some say it could be an underlying hardware issue, like the battery failing, while others believe it's a simple UI problem that a quick fix could resolve.  One user even said that "A lot of this has been happening since the last play security update. I suspect it will come out as just a bug, but you're smart to reach out to Google to see what they recommend."</p><p>That said, it isn't just the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold facing these issues; some<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelFold/comments/1nv5sqz/pixel_9_fold_battery_question_mark/"> 9 Pro Fold users </a>also seem to have spotted the weird '?' icon next to their battery, where one user stated that the error message they got was "Unable to read battery meters".

Only time will tell. But for now, if you're seeing this issue, a temporary fix, all you have to do is to reboot the phone, which returns the correct battery percentage. If you still don't see it fixing this bug, you should contact Google Support for further guidance or a possible warranty claim.</p><p>Google's spokesperson also confirmed to Android Central that rebooting the device will resolve the issue; however, "Pixel 10 Pro Fold users should use certified Qi2 wireless chargers."

The patent infringement case was first filed by Strava against Garmin on Sept. 30 in the U.S. District Court for Colorado. As of Oct. 21, Strava submitted a court filing to dismiss the suit entirely.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/10/strava-drops-voluntarily-lawsuit-against.html" target="_blank">DC Rainmaker</a>, the filing signals Strava is abandoning its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/strava-sues-garmin-over-live-segments-and-heatmaps">patent infringement case against Garmin</a>, which centered around heat maps and live segments. At the time, Strava requested a permanent injunction on the sale of Garmin watches and bike computers that it claimed used its patented technology.</p><p>The case never materialized further as Strava pulled the lawsuit before the two companies had the chance to state their positions before a judge. “Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i), Plaintiff Strava, Inc., by and through its undersigned counsel, voluntarily dismisses the above-captioned action, without prejudice," the succinct court filing states.</p><p>Garmin and Strava appeared to have a close relationship before the lawsuit, with Garmin data being a key part of Strava's platform. It's unclear how the two companies will interact going forward, or what may have transpired behind the scenes. Either way, it looks like Strava's aggressive move against Garmin is coming to a quick end.</p><h2 id="how-strava-and-garmin-got-here-2">How Strava and Garmin got here</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BAMRnLTQkKJsxq6dissQVX" name="Strava-Performance-Predictions-vs-Garmin-Race-Predictor" alt="The Strava app showing Performance Prediction times for the author's current condition for 5K, 10K, half marathon, and full marathon races, with a Garmin Fenix 8 draped above the bottom-right of the phone showing a different marathon prediction time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BAMRnLTQkKJsxq6dissQVX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Strava's dispute with Garmin not only transpired via court filings, but also in public. Matt Salazar, the chief product officer at Strava, made a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1nw8u98/setting_the_record_straight_about_garmin/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> titled "Setting the record straight about Garmin" shortly after Strava's lawsuit was first filed. The post criticized Garmin's developer guidelines for API partners, which as of July 1 required the Garmin logo to appear on content including its data.</p><p>"Unfortunately we could not justify to our users complying with the new guidelines," Salazar wrote. "As such, we have tried to resolve this situation with Garmin over the course of the past five months, including proposing additional attribution across the platform in a less intrusive way, but to no avail."</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1nw8u98/setting_the_record_straight_about_garmin">Setting the record straight about Garmin</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava">r/Strava</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>In the post's replies, many Strava users criticizing the move, stating that they likely wouldn't pay for or use the platform without Garmin data and integrations. Others called out Strava's comments as being hypocritical, as it has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html" target="_blank">a similar API policy</a> that stops other apps from displaying Strava data or using it for AI features.</p><p>The short legal battle came as Strava is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/fitness-tracking-app-strava-looks-hire-banks-ipo-2025-09-17/">prepping an initial public offering (IPO)</a>, possibly as soon as next year. The dispute put Strava front-and-center in wearable news for a few weeks, but it's unclear whether the dropped litigation attempt could help or hurt its eventual IPO.</p><p>In a completely separate case, fitness watch brand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/we-unpack-the-strava-garmin-suunto-lawsuit-situation-and-what-it-means-for-your-watch">Suunto also sued Garmin for patent infringement</a> this month. Strava's dismissal has no effect on the Suunto/Garmin lawsuit as a result, and it's safe to assume that case is still ongoing until we hear otherwise.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The operating system, based on Android 16, builds off the One UI 7 overhaul while adding new features and doubling down on Galaxy AI. Now, Samsung is bringing the One UI 8 update to the Galaxy S21 FE — and it's likely going to be its final major Android OS upgrade.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-last-major-one-ui-update-released/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> first spotted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> rollout for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe">Samsung Galaxy S21 FE</a>, which began Thursday, Oct. 23 for users in Thailand and Vietnam. There's no word on when the rollout will reach other areas, but this initial update release signals that One UI 8 is on the way globally for the Galaxy S21 FE. According to the report, the update is over 2GB in size — relatively small for a major OS upgrade — and comes with version <strong>G990EXXUIHYJ2</strong>.</p><p>Samsung's rollout pace appears to be quicker than usual for the Galaxy S21 FE. Like many Galaxy phone models, the Galaxy S21 FE received Android 15 later than expected. It only received the boost to One UI 7 back in May 2025. One UI 8 now quickly replaces it as the newest software version only a few months later.</p><p>To check for the update, open the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Galaxy S21 FE and tap the <strong>Software update</strong> tab. Then, press <strong>Download and install</strong> and <strong>Install now</strong> to load up One UI 8 when it is available. If you're not in Thailand or Vietnam, expect to wait a bit for Samsung to seed the update in more regions.</p><h2 id="will-the-samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-get-any-more-updates-2">Will the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE get any more updates?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="grZX6TH96s2PbQtRJHyTVN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE-display-sunset.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S21 FE homescreen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/grZX6TH96s2PbQtRJHyTVN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The quick One UI 8 rollout should be welcomed by Galaxy S21 FE owners, but it may be their last major Android update. Samsung first launched the Galaxy S21 FE in January 2022 with a four-year OS update promise. One UI 8 marks the fourth full Android OS upgrade the phone has received, and the Galaxy S21 FE will turn four years old in a few months. As such, we don't expect the Galaxy S21 FE to get Android 17.</p><p>However, the phone is set to receive security updates for another year after its OS upgrade guarantee ends in January 2026. Looking ahead, newer Galaxy FE phones won't lose support as quickly.

The company has now clarified that it plans to release GPU driver updates for the Pixel 10 lineup to improve performance.</p><p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-10-gpu-update-3609497/">Android Authority</a>, Google confirmed that monthly and quarterly system updates for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a> will continue to bring GPU improvements. The company said the September and October patch releases already contained GPU driver enhancements. "In future releases, we are planning further GPU driver updates," it told the publication.</p><p>Google switched to TSMC for the Pixel 10 series' <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5 chipset</a>, which should have theoretically brought major improvements. While heating has reduced compared to the previous generation, the overall performance gains on the Tensor G5 aren't substantial.</p><h2 id="gpu-driver-updates-could-boost-pixel-10-s-gaming-performance-2">GPU driver updates could boost Pixel 10's gaming performance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qhL8MhFK6Htm5sxwCCuB3b" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-system-update-01" alt="Getting a system update on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qhL8MhFK6Htm5sxwCCuB3b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some users have recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nzjp5f/pixel_10_can_barely_handle_genshin_impact_as_gpu/">reported</a> that the Pixel 10 struggles to handle games like Genshin Impact, with noticeable lag and freezing. Thankfully, Google plans to release GPU driver updates that could deliver much-needed graphics performance improvements.</p><p>For context, the Tensor G5 chipset on the Pixel 10 uses Imagination Technologies' PowerVR DXT-48-1536 GPU, which offers up to 1.5 TFLOPS FP32 performance (on paper). However, the Pixel 10's performance still trails behind phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>That's partly because the Pixel 10 ships with outdated GPU drivers. Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nca8ln/pixel_10_gpu_is_a_mess/">Reddit users</a> discovered that the Tensor G5 uses version 24.3 of the driver, which doesn't support Android 16.</p><p>And even though Imagination Technologies has already released version v25.1 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16">Android 16</a> and Vulkan 1.4 compatibility, Google has yet to update the Pixel 10's drivers. That could explain why the Pixel 10 lags behind other flagship Android devices in gaming performance.</p><p>It's possible Google's statement about upcoming GPU driver updates refers to these newer versions, though the company hasn't provided a timeline. Unfortunately, even the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-rolls-out-bootloader-fix-in-android-16-qpr2-beta-3-1">Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3.1 update</a> doesn't include these driver updates for the Pixel 10 series, so we might have to wait a bit longer for meaningful improvements.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the company’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-6-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-6s-gen-4-mobile-platform" target="_blank">product overview</a> of the chipset, the new Kryo CPU is up to 36% faster, and the Adreno GPU delivers a 59% improvement in graphics, making it a strong choice for multitaskers and mobile gamers.</p><p>This translates to smoother app launches, quicker responses, and better gameplay, all with lower power use. The platform supports 144Hz FHD+ displays. Gamers will benefit from features like Variable Rate Shading and Game Quick Touch, which improve efficiency and touch response, making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phones</a> feel closer to gaming flagships.</p><h2 id="pro-level-camera-support-2">Pro-level camera support</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hWWDBi7Bh5uYB933eCub5V" name="Infinix-Note-40-Pro-Plus-5G-07.jpg" alt="Infinix Note 40 Pro Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hWWDBi7Bh5uYB933eCub5V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the camera side, Qualcomm didn’t hold back. Like the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomms-new-snapdragon-chip-is-about-to-make-mid-range-phones-way-better">unveiled earlier this year</a>, the Snapdragon 6s Gen 4 supports up to 200MP photo capture and 2K video recording, with triple image signal processors (ISP) for more versatile shooting setups. It also uses Multi-Frame Noise Reduction (MFNR) to improve clarity in low-light shots, making photos sharper and cleaner.</p><p>With the Qualcomm Spectra ISP, users get enhanced HDR, improved color accuracy, and smoother autofocus. These features were once only found in high-end devices.</p><p>Connectivity is also much better. The built-in Snapdragon X62 5G Modem-RF system works with both sub-6GHz and mmWave bands, offering download speeds up to 2.9Gbps. The chip supports Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.4. With Qualcomm AI Engine, users get smarter camera features, better voice recognition, and real-time improvements to photos and audio.</p><p>On paper, the Snapdragon 6s Gen 4 pushes the 6-series line into new territory, making advanced features that were once reserved to the top Android phones more accessible than ever. Qualcomm hasn’t confirmed which phones will debut with the chip yet, but brands like Xiaomi, Motorola, and OPPO are expected to adopt it soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature concerns uploaded images to Gemini, which users would typically do to receive information about the subject matter. However, what the tipster states is that there is the ability to "circle" or otherwise highlight a specific area on that photo for the AI.</p><p>The feature is very similar to Android's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, which allows users to circle a screenshot and run a Search query about it. For Gemini, the tipster discovered that the AI can explain what the image is, but it also can think for itself and identify what's been circled without user input.</p><p>In the tipster's example, it seems Gemini will mention the screenshot as a whole before focusing on the content you've highlighted. The AI then gave a brief explanation of what the user selected to hopefully fulfill any questions they may have. The tipster also mentions that Gemini can lean on Google's AI image software (Nano Banana) to "remove" the highlighted/circled part of an image.</p><p>For right now, it seems we might be waiting on this feature to arrive (if it ever does). As the post points out, it's not entirely integrated in Gemini, as the menu to circle imagery is pretty barebones.</p><h2 id="one-feature-inspires-another-2">One feature inspires another</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="XdXT3qv9MSomGg7pttyj9M" name="google-gemini-circling-image-specifics" alt="A screenshot of Gemini's "circling" feature for specific portions of an image, which was reportedly spotted in development." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XdXT3qv9MSomGg7pttyj9M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">refining its Circle to Search experience</a> this year, which started around the time the Galaxy S25 series launched. AI Overviews made their debut on the feature, bringing quick, bite-sized briefs for users, giving them the info they need to know in a hurry. Google said AI Overviews in CtoS includes places, trending images, and more visual search queries. In short, it's much more useful now.</p><p>Circle to Search also gained "one-tap actions," meaning users can lean on it to pick up phone numbers, emails, and URLs.</p><p>Just last month, Google updated the feature again with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/circle-to-search-gains-real-time-translation">continuous real-time translation feature</a>.

There are two significant changes with this alleged Moto foldable, and both concern its external appearance. The biggest change, according to the uploaded WIPO illustrations, is the Razr's cover display, which is no longer square.</p><p>The drawings in question claim that this particular Razr foldable may not feature a squared cover display, but rather a circular one, centered, and against its right side frame.</p><p>It's difficult to discern in the imagery, but it seems that this circular cover display won't be as immersive as one would like. There appears to be a thick border (bezel, if you will) around its circumference. The next supposed change deals with the phone's camera array, which tacks on one more lens for a triple, vertical array.</p><p>It's hard to fathom Motorola switching up its design like this, especially after the traction the Razr series has gained with this large cover display (across its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">base and Ultra models</a>, too).
