<hr>
<p>Google Pixel owners have started voicing extreme displeasure with the company's seemingly overactive image processing software.</p><p>A thread on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1khba18/photo_processing_to_death/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Google Pixel subreddit</a> is full of users reporting odd, incorrect experiences with the phone and the processing software (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-image-processing-ruining-shots-3555627/">Android Authority</a>). The OP (original poster) called attention to the processing applied to photos taken on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. The user gives an example, using a photo of their Ford Mustang Shelby. The post shows two instances: Google's processing (left) and the correct image (right, what the viewfinder shows).</p><p>The car actually has quite a vibrant orange tone; however, Google's software seems to overdo its job, turning it into a much richer red. There are other aspects of the photo that are seemingly given a little too much saturation/richness, as opposed to what it looks like in reality.</p><p>The OP states they've experienced similar issues with the Pixel Tablet, too.</p>

<p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1khba18/comment/mr66t4d/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user chimed in</a>, stating they're having problems with Google's photo process, too. According to their post, after attempting to snap a sunset photo, their device washed out the red hues of the sky, turning things more "yellow/orange." One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1khba18/comment/mr7cnx6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">other post calls out</a> the oversaturated/boost in contrast that Google's processing delivers, which isn't ideal for some users.</p><p>The user, like the OP, states there's no way to "turn everything off" to receive a photo void of Google's post-processing touch-ups. The original poster also states that disabling Ultra HDR and "rich color in photos" doesn't help. One thing that alleviates this issue is enabling "Top Shot." But the user adds that you must do this for every photo, as there's no why to keep this on permanently or disable Google's processing.</p>
<h2 id="another-look-through-the-lens-2">Another look through the Lens</h2>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1khba18/photo_processing_to_death">Photo processing to death.</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Unfortunately, this is an issue users are struggling with, and this will likely continue until (if) Google offers a more stable solution. The OP adds they were able to get a mostly true-to-life photo from a Pixel, but they had to dip back to their old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-3-review">Pixel 3</a>.</p><p>Google's had a history of fixing and updating its Pixel camera, with its last fixes rolling in with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-april-security-update-screen-flicker-camera-fixes">April security patch</a>. The patch was light, offering a fix for "camera stability" for the Pixel 6 and 7 series "under certain conditions." Another fix was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-march-2025-security-patch-rolls-out">entered in March</a>, but Google's processing wasn't mentioned in any of its patch notes.</p><p>As the publication notes, Google could rectify this issue by showing users outright what their photo will look like in the viewfinder, instead of surprising them after. Another option could be for the company to deliver more complete control over their final image.</p><p>While we await something further, Google rolled out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-may-2025-pixel-update-is-here">May 2025 security patch</a> earlier this week. Among the fixes was a solution to a serious, critical zero-day exploit, meaning Pixel users should update as soon as possible.</p>

<hr>
<p>The CSA (Connectivity Standards Alliance) is releasing a small upgrade to v1.4 that should impact user setups in a big way.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/a-smarter-start-matter-1-4-1-makes-setup-easier/">its press release</a>, the CSA is detailing a "minor release" to its v1.4 upgrade that should refine and quicken the setup process for Matter-support devices. The CSA says these updates are "critical" to improving the setup experience users have when opening new smart home devices. This process sees Matter stepping up its support for QR codes by introducing "Multi-Device Setup QR Codes."</p><p>Many smart home users will know that some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter-supported</a> devices feature a QR code, so you can quickly scan and begin their setup process. However, the CSA states users are restricted to scanning codes one at a time and, at times, not knowing which QR code is the correct one.</p><p>Matter's Multi-Device QR code support makes it so users only need to scan one code "to set up multiple devices at once." This functionality will work so long as the devices in question feature "compatible commissioners."</p><p>Alternatively, Matter highlighted its new Onboarding Info in NFC tags. The CSA states this feature was designed to help users commission a device that's typically in an awkward spot once in place, like lightbulbs. With NFC, all users need to do is tap their device against the product. The device's onboarding information will be transferred to your phone to finalize its incorporation into your smart home.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wjB7hUWFYfXdLnpvAWTvwP" name="google-home-matter-light-update.jpg" alt="Using the Google Home app on a Google Pixel 8 Pro to turn on a smart light" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wjB7hUWFYfXdLnpvAWTvwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On a more technical level, the CSA is implementing an update to the core commissioning process via its Enhanced Setup Flow. The post states that this will support the "display of a manufacturer’s terms and conditions (T&Cs) directly in the commissioner app." Consumer consent for data will also be present. This change will affect device creators and the end user at home.</p><p>For creators, the CSA states they're now able to display their terms and conditions in apps beyond their own. For us at home, the change cuts one step out of the equation as we won't be tossed into multiple apps just for the sake of a device's terms and conditions.</p><p>The CSA's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-4-upgrade-more-device-support-roll-out">major Matter update</a>, v1.4, arrived in November with a focus on devices that'll help keep us warm in the bitter winter. The update included support for water heaters and heat pumps. Solar-powered products were also welcomed, alongside a few types of smart home batteries. The update also brought in support for thermostat scheduling and "preset modes."</p><p>With Matter 1.4, users could place their smart thermostat in "home/away and vacation" modes, depending on their situation. Matter's support includes thermostat triggering support for motion, calendar events, and more.</p>

<p>Today (May 8), Spotify detailed three new ways it's looking to improve the music discovery experience for its listeners in its app.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-05-07/experience-a-new-dimension-of-music-discovery-with-more-controls-and-enhanced-tools/">blog post</a>, Spotify highlighted the rollout of a few updates and a new test that users can expect. The platform says these updates are designed to place users "in the driver's seat" regarding their preferred listening and music discovery. Beginning with Premium subscribers, Spotify says the "Queue" is receiving an upgrade.</p><p>The post states your Queue is grabbing a visual refresh that places options like Shuffle, Smart Shuffle, Repeat, and Sleep Timer in easier-to-reach spots. Premium users are also said to see the tracks Spotify recommends in their Queue after the songs they've personally queued up are done.</p><p>Of course, Spotify's recommendations will appear if you've enabled Smart Shuffle or Autoplay. The platform says users can easily turn these off in their settings.</p><p>The test for Premium subscribers continues with an updated Hide button and a new Snooze button. The former will now hide a song on a playlist across <em>all </em>of your synced devices. The new Snooze button will give users a "temporary" break from a specific song, which lasts for 30 days.</p><p>All of these features are reportedly slowly arriving for Premium subscribers; however, there are plans to extend access to more people.</p>
<h2 id="playlist-customization-collabs-2">Playlist Customization & Collabs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1294px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="zujMii8FE4AEQpb79BMpan" name="spotify-mobile-app-playlists-menu-hero" alt="Multiple instances of the Spotify app on phones, showcasing its "Create" menu and playlists." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zujMii8FE4AEQpb79BMpan.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1294" height="728" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other side of these updates include better playlist customization options. These particularly concern mobile users, with Spotify preparing to rollout new "management tools." Mobile app users will soon find Add, Sort, and Edit buttons at the top of all of their playlists.</p><p>What's more, users who typically toss their tunes into their "Liked Songs" will find the ability to build a playlist out of its contents. Spotify says there will be an option to filter music by genre and a "turn into playlist" button. This feature in Liked Songs is rolling out for users in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the U.K., and the U.S.</p><p>Another Spotify app feature arriving is the Create Button, marked with a plus icon at the bottom-right of your phone. Spotify is placing features like playlist creation, collaborate with friends, and "join a Blend" within it. Premium users in "supported markets" go a step further by receiving access to Spotify's Jam and AI Playlists in the Create button.</p><p>Spotify's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-launches-personalized-ai-playlists">AI Playlists hit the app in testing last year</a>, giving users the ability to craft a playlist out of their words. The platform offers some pre-made suggestions to get users started if they don't know where to begin. Spotify encourages users to get creative with their ideas and see what the AI generator thinks up. The blog post reiterates AI Playlists' expansion to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-04-24/spotify-expands-ai-playlist-in-beta-to-premium-listeners-in-40-new-markets/">40 additional markets</a> a month ago, bringing more listeners into the fold.</p>

<p>Sign up for Samsung's Galaxy Reserve program before May 12th and you'll receive a $50 credit to use towards (probably) the Galaxy S25 Edge when it's announced. Simply add your name and email address to the form and the discount is as good as yours. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/the-next-galaxy/reserve/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="df3573e5-4b08-468a-8e54-8240e7ac2b9b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get $50 off the next Galaxy device before it's even announced" data-dimension48="Get $50 off the next Galaxy device before it's even announced">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Samsung has shared offers like this in the past, and believe me, it&apos;s pretty much the closest you can get to free money in this day and age. For what it&apos;s worth, I typically sign up every time new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> are announced, and I never have to deal with irritating marketing emails as a result. Samsung just hits me up once when the preorder period starts, and then I decide whether or not I want to move forward with my purchase. That&apos;s it. It&apos;s pretty nice. </p>

<p>The device in question is the fourth addition to Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a>, set to appear alongside the top-rated Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra that were released in January. If all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/massive-galaxy-s25-edge-leak-reveals-too-much">leaks and rumors</a> are correct, the Galaxy S25 Edge will boast a 6.7-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED display and use the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the rest of the flagship lineup. You can also expect loads of AI features and seven years of software updates guaranteed.</p><p>The Edge is expected to sport a smaller battery than its counterparts, presumably to make room for the ultra-thin design that gives the phone its name. The S25 Edge is set to weigh just 163 grams and clock in at 5.85 millimeters of thickness.</p><p>We&apos;re sure to see some other deals when the phone is officially announced — trade-in opportunities, free gift cards, and so on — but if you want to guarantee yourself some savings today, the Galaxy Reserve program is an easy way to snag some free cash with very little hassle. You can thank me later.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for an affordable foldable Android phone, you might have your eye on a Motorola model in the popular Razr line. There are a few generations to choose from, and two models you might be considering are the new Motorola Razr 2025 and the Motorola Razr 2023.</p><p>On the one hand, the Motorola Razr 2025 is the newer, better, latest device. On the other hand, you might find the older Motorola Razr 2023 for a steal. Perhaps you already own the latter and you’re wondering if it’s worth the upgrade. Read on to find out in this Razr 2025 vs. Razr 2023 comparison.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6k29fZHeTa8PYDA4unZvFQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-3" alt="The Razr 2025 in different colors and finishes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6k29fZHeTa8PYDA4unZvFQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3984" height="2241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 is the entry-model in the latest line from the company, which also includes the higher-end Motorola Razr Ultra and Razr+. You’ll get a 6.9-inch AMOLED FHD+ 2,640 x 1,080 HDR10+ inner screen that boasts an ultra-bright 3,000 nits of peak brightness for comfortable viewing in any condition.</p><p>The external screen, meanwhile, is a 3.6-inch 1,056 x 1,066 pOLED screen with up to 90Hz refresh rate, HDR10, and a decent 1,700 nits peak brightness. Compared to the Motorola Razr 2023, the big difference here is in the size of the external screen. You can customize the external screen with various panels for the information that is most useful to you.</p><p>You can also adjust the phone in various positions, including Flex View, even holding it like a camcorder while recording videos. There’s also dual preview and the photo booth feature which make use of both the cameras and the foldable design.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 comes in new Pantone finishes, including Gibraltar Sea, Spring Bud, Lightest Sky, and Parfait Pink with leather-inspired, nylon-inspired, and, for the first time with a Motorola device in North America, lightweight Acetate finish. It’s equipped with a titanium-reinforced hinge that Motorola says is four times stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel. It also boasts ultra-thin glass, made of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus.</p><p>The phone has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">IP48 rating for dust and water resistance</a>, stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, and three microphones. It can be purchased with up to 256GB of storage. The phone will likely run all day, leveraging the 4,500mAh battery that supports 30W TurboPower charging to get an extra day after just a 15-minute charge. It also supports 15W wireless charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3999px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="fXTHrsCDX5KzynkbG2UGgT" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-14.jpg" alt="The Razr 2023 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fXTHrsCDX5KzynkbG2UGgT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3999" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparatively, the Motorola Razr 2023 comes with a vegan leather finish on the back complemented by a brushed metal finish that Android Central's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2023-review">Derrek Lee says in his review</a> feels and looks “classy.” Available in Sage Green, Vanilla Cream, Summer Lilac, or Cherry Blossom finishes, the inner screen is the same 6.9-inch size, a pOLED with the same 2,640 x 1,080 resolution, up to 144Hz refresh rate, and HDR10+, but it’s less bright at just 1,400 nits, though Lee still calls it “punchy and bright.”</p><p>The biggest difference when it comes to appearance lies with the external display, which, in this phone, is just 1.5 inches in size. The tiny, rectangular OLED with 194 x 368 resolution, 60Hz refresh rate, and up to 1,000 nits brightness more resembles the screen of a smartwatch or a fitness tracker built into the outside of the phone. It’s effectively a small black bar that shows limited details. It’s a simple design meant mostly for glanceable information, but it might be appreciated by some to limit distractions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HhP7MdUAanqZRCEpx9bqha" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-13.jpg" alt="A clock face on the Razr 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HhP7MdUAanqZRCEpx9bqha.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lee notes that customization is limited to panels for things like weather, calendar, contracts, media, a timer, and an audio recorder. Swipe among them using a carousel, swipe down to access Quick Settings, or swipe up to see notifications.</p><p>While you can do simple things like delete an email from the external screen, for most interactions, you will need to open the phone. You can, it should be noted, take photos and preview the shot from the external screen as well. However, it’s challenging to take and orient them using the external screen, and you’re limited in the modes you use.</p><p>The phone has a sturdy hinge that Lee says leaves a minimal crease and feels even sturdier than the one on the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 model. The screen is covered in Gorilla Glass Victus for additional durability. It meets a higher IP52 rating for dust, but that’s less for water. So, this phone is more durable against larger objects but less able to withstand water sprays.</p><p>Oddly, it only comes with 128GB non-expandable storage, so you’ll need a cloud service if you plan to take tons of photos and videos, download apps, and more. You’ll likely run out of room fairly quickly if you’re a digital packrat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfBHpEDKGkAcMfetHV7WBY" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-8.jpg" alt="Notifications on the Razr 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfBHpEDKGkAcMfetHV7WBY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery-wise, you get a decent 4,200mAh battery with the Motorola Razr 2023, which Lee says doesn’t quite last a full day, but will get you through most of one before you need to recharge. It also supports 30W wired charging, but you’ll only be able to charge at a 5W snail’s pace with wireless chargers. It’s almost not even worth it unless you keep the phone atop a wireless charger on your desk all day.</p><p>This phone also has stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos and Spatial Sound along with three microphones. With both, you get the usuals like a fingerprint sensor, face unlock, Bluetooth 5.3, 5G connectivity, NFC, and more.</p><p>One important detail worth noting is that with both phones, Motorola promises three years of Android updates and four years of security updates. Since the Motorola Razr 2023 was introduced in North America back in October 2023, you already need to shave more than a year off that count.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 focuses heavily on an AI experience, as most of the latest phones do today. It comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> and, as mentioned, three years of software and four years of security updates. That’s behind others like Google and Samsung, which also make foldable phones. But it’s still pretty decent, getting you through to Android 18.</p><p>Running on an upgraded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400x</a> processor, which affords boosted AI performance, it’s the only phone in the new line that doesn’t run on a Snapdragon processor. However, Derrek Lee says in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">his initial hands-on of the Motorola Razr 2025</a> that he didn’t have any performance issues using previous generation Razr phones running on the older version of this processor, so he suspects the same will be the case with this phone.</p><p>You’ll get 8GB RAM and Google Gemini and Gemini Live alongside Moto AI.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, you can enjoy features like Catch Me Up, Pay Attention, and Remember Thus. There’s also Next Move on the external display, which will recognize what’s on the screen and offer suggestions for your, well, next move. This could be creating a music playlist for you while you cook dinner using a recipe you found online, or making a new wallpaper image inspired by an upcoming vacation.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a> with AI features allows you to give text or voice commands to share content from your phone to the TV, or even do things like pull up notes on a PC, great for multitasking.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3968px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6hjeFcH6peFiy4559RGSZb" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-10.jpg" alt="Moto Unplugged on the Razr 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6hjeFcH6peFiy4559RGSZb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3968" height="2232" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>How does the Motorola Razr 2023 compare? Since it was introduced a year and a half ago, it comes loaded with Android 13 and MyUX, which means you’ll only get up to Android 16 with this phone. That’s something to consider if you want a foldable you can hang onto for many years to come. The integration of MyUX adds some fun and useful customization features, though, like being able to twist the phone twice to activate the camera or chop twice to trigger the flashlight.</p><p>It runs on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-7-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 7 Gen 1</a> processor that Lee says gets the job done and comes with the same 8GB RAM. “The phone is able to handle much of my daily tasks without faltering,” says Derrek. He also found that it performed well for gaming, though it gets warm if you play intense games at the highest setting.</p><p>The big omission here is that you don’t get any AI experiences, beyond being able to access limited Google Gemini and Google Photos features. It’s overall a fairly basic phone that even has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-razr-plus-update-brings-moto-unplugged">Moto Unplugged</a> feature to help you disconnect when you need a digital detox break, effectively Motorola’s version of Focus Mode.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3725px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WpsdAUJDnMcVNvncKRwDfU" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-1.jpg" alt="The Razr 2023 on a pile of leaves" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WpsdAUJDnMcVNvncKRwDfU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3725" height="2095" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the cameras. The Motorola Razr 2025 has a 50MP main rear camera, a 13MP ultrawide camera with macro vision, and a 32MP front camera. You should theoretically get better photos with the AI-powered photo enhancement engine. We can’t speak to that until we’ve had more time with the phone. Stay tuned.</p><p>By comparison, the Motorola Razr 2023 has a larger sensor, a 64MP rear main camera, a 13MP ultra-wide camera with macro vision, and a 32MP front “selfie” camera.</p><p>Derrek says the phone takes decent photos, but they often leave him wanting more. It lacks in areas like contrast, white balance, color balance, or simple punch, but does take fairly good night shots. The results with photos are also inconsistent. Basically, the camera experience is not a selling point for this phone.</p><p>Enjoy all the usual features you’ll find in Motorola phones for capturing the best shots, like burst shot, auto smile, portrait, night vision, quick capture, and more. There are also features like gesture capture with the front camera and face beauty. But you’ll have to choose and store your photos wisely since there’s only a 128GB option.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-razr-2025-vs-motorola-razr-2023-which-should-you-choose-2">Motorola Razr 2025 vs. Motorola Razr 2023: Which should you choose?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Denu4EfRCdzoo6borEdDZQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-2" alt="Three Razr 2025 phones stacked on top of each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Denu4EfRCdzoo6borEdDZQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It stands to reason that when considering the Motorola Razr 2025 vs. Motorola Razr 2023, the newer phone of the two is better. The Motorola Razr 2025 employs a better design, mostly better specs, and AI experiences that have become important nowadays for everything from convenience to assistance and even taking photos and videos.</p><p>With that said, it’s not a massive step-up from the Motorola Razr 2023, and still only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-vs-razr-2024">an iterative update from the Motorola Razr 2024</a>. So, if you invested a bunch in one of those older foldables already, it’s worth hanging onto for now, at least until the software support runs out. By then, Motorola will likely have an even better foldable to consider. If you really want to upgrade now, you’d be better off saving up to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, which is a bigger jump in features and will better justify the switch.</p><p>If you’re buying new and you find the Motorola Razr 2023 for cheap, amortize that cost over the number of years of use it has left when it comes to software and security support. It might sound like a good deal now, but it might not be in the long run. If you just want something for now, however, and plan to upgrade in two years anyway, go for it. Or, as noted, consider the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> instead, which ranks among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phones</a> as the best budget option you can buy right now.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4126px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kCvXeZAPLvcYnUPUW47z6U" name="Motorola-Razr-2023-review-15.jpg" alt="A notification on the Razr 2023 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kCvXeZAPLvcYnUPUW47z6U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4126" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One important thing to note between the Motorola Razr 2025 and Razr 2023 is the difference in the external screen. The Motorola Razr 2023’s external screen is mostly for glancing at notifications, like a news strip across the bottom. “This cover screen,” Derrek explains, “is meant to give you the bare minimum while still serving its purpose of letting you decide whether or not it’s worth it to open your phone. It’s a shame Motorola couldn’t put a larger display on the outside.”</p><p>If you want something more robust with a much larger external screen, you’ll find value in the Motorola Razr 2025’s larger external screen. But you might also appreciate fewer distractions with the smaller screen of the Motorola Razr 2023. In this respect, it comes down to personal preference.</p>

With the... erm... messy launch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>, it might be tempting to jump on board and give it a spin. Don't.</p><p>The idea of wrecking a phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> with unfinished buggy software is insane to me. I can see why it might sound tempting, but still, you're taking an expensive and finely tuned piece of machinery and installing software held together with rubber bands and wishes, hoping the useful bits are worth the inevitable problems that will arise.</p>

<p>No, I'm not talking trash about Samsung. Not at all. I think Samsung makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">finest phones money can buy</a>, and if one of the premium models fits into your budget you're going to be pleased with it. That goes for both the hardware and the software. It took a while to get here, but Samsung has shown how a company can use Android to make its products better than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">the "original" straight from Google</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-8-alleged-early-preview-report">One UI 8</a> will continue this trend. The company will change what needs to be changed in a way that seems meaningful, with the purpose of adding value to its products. A lot of people will agree and love it. But not until it's ready. We've seen time and time again what happens when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-launch-messy">release software that's not ready</a>; it's ugly and something you should never expect to happen on a very pricey phone.</p>

<p>When the One UI 8 beta <em>does</em> launch, people will be rushing to find a way to try it, and plenty of those folks will wish they hadn't. Don't take my word for it, just look at any internet community to see people getting more trouble than they bargained for with an experimental software build. The earliest builds aren't for you anyway, unless you're a developer looking to test how potential changes affect your product.</p><p>Samsung is going to show us something from One UI 8 that we really want to try, probably when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">announces the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7</a> or maybe even as a surprise at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O</a>. That doesn't mean it's ready for us just yet. Give it time to cook, and it will taste a lot better.</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps on iOS now lets you save locations directly from screenshots using Gemini.</li><li>A new "Screenshots" list can be seen in the 'You' tab on Google Maps, prompting users to review and save recognized locations.</li><li>The new feature eliminates the need to manually search for locations seen in screenshots on social media or the web.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Maps for iOS is getting quite an interesting feature that lets you save locations from screenshots.</p><p>Imagine you are that kind of person who often checks for new places either on the web or on social media — like a reel that shows some beautiful location. While you immediately screenshot it, Google Maps can now make a list of such screenshots in the app and help you save that location with the help of Gemini.</p>
<p>It is supposedly a new functionality, which is rolling out to Google Maps for iOS devices (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/07/google-maps-screenshots-iphone/">9to5Google</a>). Previously, users who saved the aforementioned screenshots would go into their phone's gallery to see the location and again open up the Maps location and check for the location to get an idea.</p><p>The new Maps feature, however, would save you from these steps and instead users would need to check for the 'You' tab in the Google Maps app wherein users will see a new Screenshots list with a badge indicating "Try it out."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1439px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.70%;"><img id="GApQtBK5RRfdoLxhJvfTkj" name="Google-Maps-Screenshot-saving-feature" alt="Google Maps screenshot location saving feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GApQtBK5RRfdoLxhJvfTkj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1439" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="using-the-new-screenshots-feature-on-google-maps-2">Using the new Screenshots feature on Google Maps</h2>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/maps/how-to-google-maps-screenshot-save-gemini/">shares a how-to post</a> explaining how to use the feature. Tapping "Try it out" will open up a video showcasing how the feature works, and users can simultaneously check the feature as well.</p><p>Firstly, users will have to allow Google Maps to access their photos, following which whenever a user takes a screenshot of the location info, they can directly head to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-maps">Google Maps</a> app wherein it recognizes a place and "a message will pop up telling you that it has places ready for you to review."</p><p>Users can then tap "review" if they want to save the image to their screenshots list or not, which is found on the "You" section of the Google Maps app. Consumers can also add older screenshots to the same list if they want to.</p>

<p>With the help of Gemini, users will be able to see the saved directly on their Google Maps or can look from the aforementioned list whenever required.</p><p>As 9to5 notes, the feature is currently rolling out to iOS devices, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android handsets</a> are likely to get it soon. Google previously highlighted this feature earlier this year in March, as part of its AI updates to get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-flights-traveling-trends-updates">users ready for the summer</a>. There were other updates mentioned, as well, like the ability for users to receive "trip ideas" for distinct regions and places in AI Overviews.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing fans have been wondering about the next major flagship phone launch, and that appears to be on the horizon.</p><p>The company recently dropped a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1920137994893230380">emoji teasers on X</a> that could indicate the impending launch of a long-awaited device. The first teaser involves a smartphone emoji, while the second one, posted earlier today (May 8), is an emoji for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1920478376378179611">the number three</a>. The teasers have left users on X curious for more, as these are the first real teasers concerning the Phone 3.</p><p>Nothing hasn't expanded its teasers just yet, and its CEO, Carl Pei, has been awfully quiet about the Phone 3 emoji posts, as well.</p><p>The company's next flagship has been a long time coming, especially after being delayed for features we've seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and 3a Pro</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pushed-aside-for-the-sake-of-ai-2">Pushed aside for the sake of AI</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro with LED lights enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most of the current user excitement stems from Nothing's cancellation of the Phone 3 launch last year, for the sake of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">furthering its AI ambitions</a>. In an X update, Carl Pei detailed Nothing's new plans to focus more on AI, as it "prototyped AI interactions." Pei also stated that the company was working on redefining how users utilize their smartphones. Additionally, Pei said, "The current user experience hasn't evolved for more than a decade."</p><p>Nothing's AI (at the time) was touted as a piece of software that would be "highly personalized and dynamic" with a "cross-device interface."</p><p>It was speculated that the company's AI ambitions were more on-device focused, thus forcing it to make a decision: rush a Phone 3 launch in 2024 or wait. It chose the latter.</p><p>We've since seen Nothing's on-device AI come to life in the Phone 3a and 3a Pro, which brought its new physical button, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">the Essential Key</a>, for its Essential Space suite of features. This hub lets users organize and rediscover screenshots, quickly capture voice notes, and much more.</p>
<h2 id="a-rapid-focus-on-the-phone-3-2">A "Rapid Focus" on the Phone 3</h2>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3⃣<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1920478376378179611">May 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>After Nothing confirmed the Phone 3a series in January, its co-founder, Akis Evangelidis, stated the Phone 3 is still on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">tap for a 2025 debut</a>. Evangelidis added that the device would be a "milestone" for the company with a "rapid focus" right after the 3a series rolled out to consumers. With that in mind, Carl Pei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-ceo-carl-pei-reassures-fans-phone-3-is-definitely-coming-to-the-u-s">recently reassured fans</a> on social media that the Phone 3 is coming to the U.S., "100%!"</p><p>Now, one week later, we're seeing emoji teasers, potentially indicating its launch is within reach.</p><p>Rumors about the device have been sparse; however, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-database-listing-chip-details-leak">database listing</a> late last year suggested it could launch with a 6.5-inch OLED display. Curiously, the phone's SoC of choice is still up in the air. Some rumors claim it could drop with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, but this chip debuted on the 3a and 3a Pro. Other rumors claim we could see the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3.</p><p>Much of this speculation is on the back of Nothing's ambitions to develop AI, which both chips can help with. For now, with such confusion in the rumors, it's best to wait for Nothing's official say-so, especially since we're seeing a few teasers.</p>

This also means that some Razr Plus 2025 cases are cheaper, as they've been around for a while.</p><p>With a foldable that's this snatched and fashionable, it's a shame to cover it up. I say go for a transparent or semi-transparent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr Plus 2025</a> case so you can still admire the lovely texture and color.

<h2 id="it-s-not-too-difficult-to-find-the-right-razr-plus-2025-case-for-your-needs-2">It's not too difficult to find the right Razr Plus 2025 case for your needs</h2>
<p>Good news! The best Motorola Razr Plus 2025 cases include some of the most popular Razr Plus 2024 cases. That's why so many of these options are a lot cheaper than they feel like they should be. Even if your budget is as constrained as $10, you can get a nice case for your shiny new foldable.</p><p>I adore the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">sensory experience of the Razr Plus 2025</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">its siblings</a> present. Hiding that stunning design behind a gaudy phone cover isn't something you'd want to do. However, it's also true that a cracked phone is worse than a clunky phone in a case. A good compromise between the two is to get a clear case.</p><p>When it comes to good clear cases for your Razr Plus 2025, I highly recommend getting one with a Qi2 or MagSafe ring. This makes your Razr even more functional and you can then use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">magnetic accessories for Android</a> with it, like car chargers, holders, etc. The Fin2feel Magnetic Razr Plus 2024/2025 Case is roughly $16 and it delivers exactly that premise, which is why it's my top pick.</p><p>Alternatively, you could take a more extreme route to protect your Motorola Razr Plus 2025 from calamities of all nature. This would need a rugged case like the Poetic Spartan or the Vizvera Case with Hinge Cover. Both come with built-in screen protectors, but Poetic has a more established name in the industry and makes higher-quality accessories. If you're not sold on that nearly $40 price tag though, then the Vizvera should suffice.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, Motorola has carved out quite a reputation for itself as one of the key players in the world of foldable phones. And with the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025 series</a>, the brand looks poised to solidify that position even further.</p><p>To that end, Motorola is giving prospective consumers more choice than before. If you are thinking about getting a new flip-style phone from Motorola, you can pick from the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Razr 2025, Razr Plus 2025, and Razr Ultra 2025</a>. The trio has numerous design improvements like a more durable titanium hinge, IP48 certification for better dust and water resistance, and a range of funky colors to pick from.</p><p>All three members of the Razr 2025 family also get upgraded internals. The top-tier Razr 2025 Ultra deserves a special mention here since it can compete with some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> available.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6k29fZHeTa8PYDA4unZvFQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-3" alt="The Razr 2025 in different colors and finishes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6k29fZHeTa8PYDA4unZvFQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3984" height="2241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, all this hardware needs power, which is why Motorola's latest foldables pack in larger batteries with faster charging (in both wired and wireless modes) capabilities.</p><p>The base Razr 2025 comes with a 4,500mAh battery that supports 30W wired and 15W wireless charging. Then there's the Razr Plus 2025, which has a 4,000mAh battery with 45W wired and 15W wireless charging support. You also get 5W reverse charging that can be used to juice up smaller devices such as wireless earbuds. Lastly, the Razr Ultra 2025 features a 4,700mAh battery with support for 68W and 30W wireless charging. It includes 5W reverse charging as well.</p><p>While these charging speeds are great, it's important to know that you need the right wall charger for them. Since none of the latest Razr foldables comes bundled with one (as is the case with most smartphones these days), you can get one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">best USB-C fast chargers</a> for the best experience.</p><p>Considering that the previous-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> managed to impress Android Central managing editor Derrek Lee with their battery life, we have little doubt that Motorola's latest foldables will also exceed our expectations.</p>

Mojang originally launched VR support for Minecraft Bedrock on the Samsung Gear VR back in April 2016, porting the experience over to the PC version that August. PSVR support was added in 2020, but things went downhill from there.</p>

<p>While there was a way to play the old Gear VR version on the Oculus Go and the original Oculus Quest, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-does-not-support-oculus-go-games">the Oculus Quest 2 ended support</a> for these older games, making it impossible to play. As Mojang slowly pulled the plug on Minecraft VR as an officially supported concept, modders took up the mantle the company failed to uphold.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vivecraft.org/">Vivecraft</a> is by far the most successful Minecraft VR mod. It adds VR support to Minecraft Java, including made-for-VR mechanics that Mojang never bothered to add to the Bedrock version. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sidequestvr.com/app/7150/questcraft" target="_blank">QuestCraft</a>, a port of Vivecraft made to run natively on Meta Quest headsets, debuted in February 2022 and was a gem until the v71 Meta Quest update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/QuestCraftPlusPlus/QuestCraft/issues/639">broke the game</a> in December 2024.</p><p>The only official reason Mojang has given for ending VR support is a cop-out, at best. "Our ability to support VR/MR devices has come to an end," says Mojang's Jay Wells in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-40-bedrock-changelog">October 2024 update changelog</a>, making it sound like Mojang doesn't have enough funds or resources to get the job done. But nothing could be further from the truth, and the rest of the politics of Meta and Microsoft's recent work further muddle an already confounding decision.</p>

<h2 id="let-s-so-some-quick-math-2">Let's so some quick math</h2>

<p>Since Microsoft seems allergic to giving official player counts for anything these days, I have to estimate things based on other factors. We know that Minecraft sold more than 300 million copies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/minecraft/minecraft-crosses-300-million-copies-sold-as-it-prepares-to-celebrate-its-15th-anniversary">as of October 2023</a>, and statistics firms like DemandSage estimate that Minecraft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.demandsage.com/minecraft-statistics/">sees over 55 million </a><em>daily active players</em>. Only games like Fortnite can match those numbers, again <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/fortnite-stats">according to statistics groups</a>.</p><p>Mojang employs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/mojang-studios-feels-like-underfunded-indie-studio">over 600 people</a>, and recent successes like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/a-minecraft-movie-continues-to-print-money-and-fans-can-now-go-to-special-screenings-and-be-as-loud-as-they-please">the Minecraft Movie</a> further add to the hundreds of millions of dollars Minecraft makes for Microsoft every year.</p><p>So, how in the world can a studio that's this massive, with this much funding and annual revenue, confidently proclaim that its "ability to support VR/MR devices has come to an end?" None of it makes any sense, and no one seems to know why.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>QuestCraft, the only native Quest port of Minecraft, is run by four individuals in their spare time. Surely Mojang could match this effort.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The best answer I could gather is that the number of VR players would be "a drop in the bucket" compared to the number of Minecraft players worldwide. That may be true, but it wouldn't take very many staff members to properly support a Minecraft VR on the world's most popular VR platform, Meta Quest. QuestCraft, the only native Quest port of Minecraft, is run by four individuals in their spare time. Surely Mojang could match this effort.</p><p>The Meta Quest's demographics have been shifting younger and younger over the years, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">free-to-play content ruling the roost</a> for revenue and player count on the platform every month. Unironically, this exact demographic is the one that would put the most time into Minecraft if it were officially launched as a Meta Quest game.</p><p>Back in 2020, then Oculus CTO John Carmack famously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/minecraft-oculus-quest-carmack/">got Minecraft running on the Quest</a> "with full positional tracking," something Mojang already had working just fine on the PC side of things. For some untold reason, this version of the game was never officially picked up by Mojang.</p>

<p>All of this becomes more confusing when you consider Meta and Microsoft's other VR partnerships over the past year. You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xbox-game-pass-meta-quest-launch">play Xbox Game Pass games on Quest</a>, Windows 11 has an official linking app so you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-11-vr-integration-meta-quest-announcement">can use your PC on a Quest</a>, and even Microsoft Office <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/microsoft-office-is-finally-available-on-meta-quest-headsets">has official Meta Quest apps</a>. Oh, and don't forget that we're still due for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">Xbox-branded Meta Quest headset</a> that was announced last April.</p><p>Meta claims to have attempted to work with Microsoft on getting an official port even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/boztank/status/1827380465390755984">as recently as August 2024</a>, but, strangely, hasn't seemed to be able to make any progress.</p><p>If I were being overly optimistic, I'd say that Mojang killed the PC VR version of Minecraft Bedrock in favor of launching a native Quest version later this year. I'd probably lose money if I bet on that, but there's a very real expectation that these third-party Meta Horizon OS-powered headsets should be launching later this year to compete with the official release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, and this would tie in perfectly with those announcements.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Everyone loses when Mojang decides that Minecraft players don't want VR support, and it's ridiculous that Microsoft and Mojang don't see that.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>No matter the reason, Mojang is leaving money on the table by not supporting a native Meta Quest Minecraft VR. The official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.com/invite/questcraft">QuestCraft Discord server</a> has 80,000 users with dozens of new ones joining every day. That's for a mod of a game that requires you to sign up for a developer account <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sideload-apps-oculus-quest">and then sideload it</a> onto your Quest just to play. Oh, plus, you need to own Minecraft Java, not Bedrock, for it to work.</p><p>Imagine, then, how many more players would be on Minecraft VR if there were an official Bedrock version of the game? It's not hard to expect that number to be in the hundreds of thousands or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/1hioq4m/animal_company_has_cross_1_million_active_players/">over a million active players</a>, as the most popular Quest games have.</p><p>That's players buying stuff on the Marketplace, people subscribing to Realms so they can more easily play with friends on their own time, and players making even more content for their YouTube channels. Everyone loses when Mojang decides that Minecraft players don't want VR support, and it's ridiculous that Microsoft and Mojang don't see that.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung might make a One UI 8 beta program available based on Android 16 this month, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-one-ui-8-beta-should-start-this-month/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>. The publication says that it hears the One UI 8 beta will kick off in the third week of May 2025, which is less than two weeks away. In terms of availability, it's expected the One UI 8 beta will be extremely limited to certain devices and regions initially, with expanded access in June 2025.</p><p>The move comes following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/someone-with-a-galaxy-s25-ended-up-getting-an-alleged-one-ui-8-update">Samsung's internal testing of One UI 8</a>. A version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>-based upgrade appeared on test servers earlier today, May 8, which is a sign that the South Korean company is preparing for a public beta.</p><p>The update, with build version <strong>S938BXXU3ZYEA/S938BOXM3ZYEA/S938BXXU3BYEA</strong>, was spotted on a test server for the Samsung Galaxy S25 by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1920374301066207715" target="_blank">Tarun Vats on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, One UI 7 beta builds started appearing on test servers a few weeks before they became available to the public. This is the first time a One UI 8 beta build has appeared on a Samsung test server, and it's a key indicator that the beta program could start very soon.</p>

<p>The emergence of an early One UI 8 beta program might come as a surprise considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-launch-messy">the struggles Samsung experienced delivering One UI 7</a>, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. That update was a multi-year overhaul that brought many challenges, whereas One UI 8 is expected to be a smaller and more manageable update. Paired with Google moving up its Android release schedule, this all helps explain why One UI 8 appears to be progressing quicker than expected.</p><p>Separately, it's rumored that Samsung will launch its new foldables — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> — with One UI 8 out of the box.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<ul><li>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 might break records as the world’s thinnest foldable, measuring just 3.9mm open and 8.9mm folded.</li><li>Samsung is focusing on thinner, lighter designs for its flagship devices, with the Z Fold 7 sticking to the same 4,400mAh battery as its predecessor.</li><li>The Z Flip 7 could also get a battery bump to 4,300mAh, up from 4,000mAh in the Z Flip 6.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new rumor says Samsung's upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> might just break records as the slimmest foldable phone ever made when it sees daylight.</p><p>According to reliable tipster @UniverseIce, Samsung is switching gears, focusing on making its flagship phones way thinner and lighter (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-7-worlds-thinnest-foldable-phone-report/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). Backing that up, the tipster claims the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-thinner-folded-profile-speculation-report">set to launch as the thinnest foldable out there</a>, measuring just 3.9mm when open and 8.9mm folded.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">According to some exclusive information, the next direction of Samsung flagship machine is still to be thin and light, and the battery will be thin and thin, and the body will continue to be thin. The Galaxy Z Fold7 will be the thinnest folding machine in the world at that time,… pic.twitter.com/uAs3NzAf8j<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1919997501807198212">May 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<h2 id="same-battery-new-tricks-2">Same battery, new tricks?</h2>
<p>Digging into the battery side of things, @UniverseIce backed up earlier leaks saying the Z Fold 7 will stick with the same 4,400mAh battery as the last model. The leak also teased some fresh battery tech and charging tricks under the hood for this one.</p><p>However, the battery might feel a bit underwhelming, especially next to the Oppo Find N5’s 5,600mAh cell. The Chinese phone maker pulled that off by using a high-density silicon-carbon mix in its battery, letting the company pack more juice into the same space.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.97%;"><img id="GtyCmJKLo7RwHmMt2AotPY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaked-rendering-closed-angled" alt="A leaked rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in its closed form, showcasing a slightly thinner form factor." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GtyCmJKLo7RwHmMt2AotPY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="788" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery doubts aside, if the Z Fold 7 really is the thinnest foldable ever, that could be Samsung’s secret weapon to stand out in the crowded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> segment. With its recent slip in the foldable rankings, pulling off something this sleek might be just what it needs to turn heads again.</p><p>For context, the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> measures 12.2mm thick when folded and 5.6mm when open. Meanwhile, Oppo’s Find N5 holds the crown as the slimmest book-style foldable at just 8.93mm folded and 4.21mm unfolded. So if Samsung really manages to go even thinner with the Fold 7, it’s a major flex in foldable design.</p>
<h2 id="thinness-over-battery-2">Thinness over battery?</h2>
<p>If the latest rumors hold true, Samsung could soon snatch the crown for the world’s thinnest foldable from Oppo. That’s, of course, unless Oppo surprises us with a new, even slimmer Find N model before Samsung drops its Z Fold 7.</p><p>Switching gears to the Z Flip 7, the same insider hints at an upgraded 4,300mAh battery, up from the 4,000mAh in the Z Flip 6. Multiple sources have backed this up, making it look like a solid upgrade for the next-gen device.</p><p>Samsung’s move to focus on a thinner foldable, even if it means sacrificing some battery life, is a bold gamble. Whether it pays off will come down to how the device performs in everyday use.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>India-based smart ring brand Ultrahuman has announced plans to produce 100% of its popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ring Air</a> devices for U.S. customers in its Texas "UltraFactory" by the end of 2025, showing no signs of slowing down despite its current legal hurdles.</p><p>While Ultrahuman says this facility currently produces 400 Ring Air units per day, the eventual goal is to "soon scale its production to more than half a million units annually" — or at least 1,370 per day — so that it no longer needs to import any smart rings from India.</p><p>"The UltraFactory in Plano, Texas, allows us to deliver products faster, enhance quality control, and further strengthen our commitment to American consumers to bring them cutting-edge health technology," says Ultrahuman CEO Mohit Kumar.</p><p>The press release goes on to say that domestic smart ring production will ensure "faster shipping, better service, and increased reliability." It would also help Ultrahuman avoid any tariffs on ring sales, while creating "hundreds of high-skilled jobs" in Plano.</p>

<p>Oura is trying to stop Ultrahuman and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> makers from selling or importing their products in the United States. This announcement shows that Ultrahuman will stick to business as usual, unless the International Trade Commission (ITC) forces the issue.</p><p>A recent U.S. ITC judge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-wins-major-us-trade-case-against-smart-ring-rivals">ruled against Ultrahuman</a> in favor of Oura over alleged patent infringements, though it was merely an initial determination. In that ruling, the judge disputed Ultrahuman's claims that it had a manufacturing facility in Texas, suggesting it had submitted slides with Photoshopped images of the Ultrahuman logo added to SVTronics facilities.</p><p>The judge called this a "concerning issue regarding Ultrahuman's credibility," and clearly, Ultrahuman hopes to refute this concern by publicly unveiling the UltraFactory as a real and productive facility.</p>

<p>In a blog post titled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.ultrahuman.com/blog/so-whats-the-patent-that-oura-is-suing-everyone-for/">"So what’s the patent that Oura is suing everyone for?"</a> Ultrahuman makes its case for why Oura's smart ring patent shouldn't apply to them, claiming it has a strong case to dispute the initial findings in post-review and that "70% of such proceedings result in invalidation of all challenged claims."</p><p>It then boasts about its Texas facilities as the "first-ever Smart ring manufacturing facility" in the United States and says it will "double down" on U.S. sales rather than preemptively accept the ruling.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-itc-case/">Oura's blog post</a> praises the patent system as a "cornerstone of American innovation" and its "talented team members based in the U.S.," while decrying the "dishonest tactics" of its "foreign competitors." Clearly, both smart ring brands see value in looking as "American" as possible as this legal battle proceeds.</p><p>Ultimately, the ITC filing notes that Oura and competing brands like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> have "the manufacturing capability to replace <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn</a> and Ultrahuman's accused products if they are excluded from the U.S. market." But given this UltraFactory announcement, Ultrahuman has no plans to cede its U.S. smart ring business just yet.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It's easy enough to craft great-sounding IEMs in the mid-range and high-end categories; brands often work with quality materials and can take the time to tune these products to a greater extent. That's why I've always maintained that the budget segment is where you get the most amount of excitement — there isn't much in the way of margins, and audio makers have to know what they're doing to be able to deliver something that sounds good while still being affordable.</p><p>That's what Oriveti is aiming to do with the Blackbird; the Chinese brand partnered with India's leading audio store Headphone Zone over the Blackbird, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.headphonezone.in/products/headphone-zone-x-oriveti-blackbird">coming in at just ₹4,999</a> ($58), they're a downright bargain when you consider the sound quality. It's no wonder, then, that the Blackbird is the best-selling IEM on the site's budget category.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8LVaZeJ48wY9ReDSffyc7k" name="oriveti-blackbird-8" alt="Oriveti Blackbird IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8LVaZeJ48wY9ReDSffyc7k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Blackbird is a custom collaboration, but it is based on the bleqk Lowmaster, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORIVETI-bleqk-LOWMASTER-Detachable-Ear/dp/B0DG5M5CPZ">costs $149 IEM on Amazon</a>. You get the same design but with a glossier shell and additional logos, and it has the same set of drivers and identical accessories. After using the IEMs, I'm convinced that they're a bargain.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="32nAWEUjBcQBczt6yeL3zj" name="oriveti-blackbird-7" alt="Oriveti Blackbird IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/32nAWEUjBcQBczt6yeL3zj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oriveti went with 3D printed shells that are comfortable to wear, and I didn't see any issues with fatigue even with extended use. They're light enough that you don't notice you're wearing IEMs, and the sound tube doesn't nozzle into the ear canal too much.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3uRPhiqoR5dELUnbSADQQk" name="oriveti-blackbird-5" alt="Oriveti Blackbird IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3uRPhiqoR5dELUnbSADQQk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the overt logo doesn't look as clean as the standard model, there are no problems with the fit, and the build quality is great. The IEMs have standard 2-pin connectors, and the bundled cable is of a decent quality; it has a 3.5mm plug, and the braided design is durable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="sv7T5ikNirQuWHBUMaGLCk" name="oriveti-blackbird-3" alt="Oriveti Blackbird IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sv7T5ikNirQuWHBUMaGLCk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's also a hard shell carrying case, and it does a good job safeguarding the IEMs. You get a good selection of ear tips bundled in the package, and I found that the silicone option had the ideal seal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="M8rj2oQC365H6xE9JmQgYk" name="oriveti-blackbird-9" alt="Oriveti Blackbird IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M8rj2oQC365H6xE9JmQgYk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the Blackbird with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m15s-review">Fiio's excellent M15S</a>, and also tested the IEMs with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">K19</a>. The Blackbird has two balanced armature drivers aimed at the mid-range and high-end frequencies, with a 10mm dynamic driver handling the low-end. There is some bass exuberance with the IEMs, but I wouldn't call these bass-focused — the 7Hz Legato is still the better choice if you predominantly listen to bass-heavy tunes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="QBC6DJ2nmP2hcnSWRiWvPk" name="oriveti-blackbird-10" alt="Oriveti Blackbird IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QBC6DJ2nmP2hcnSWRiWvPk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the Blackbird has a clean low-end with some energy and vibrancy. The mid-range comes through with decent clarity, and the bass doesn't overshadow it to any noticeable degree. Treble has good detail, but it doesn't extend to the higher frequencies; on the bright side, there's no sibilance to the sound.</p>
<p>There's a warmth to the tuning that makes the Blackbird enjoyable to use. It's obvious that Oriveti tuned these IEMs for casual listening sessions, and you still get an immersive soundstage. They're not highly technical, but that isn't the point — these are designed to be easy to listen to a variety of genres, and they excel in doing so.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="nGgyNjhoTTLtqsKKUU9yEk" name="oriveti-blackbird-6" alt="Oriveti Blackbird IEM review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nGgyNjhoTTLtqsKKUU9yEk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, the IEMs are a good choice if you're just getting started and want a set with a bass-forward sound. They're incredibly easy to drive, have a good sound with decent detail retrieval, and you get a durable design along with a terrific value.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Baseus is slowly but steadily building momentum globally — the brand makes some of my favorite charging accessories. I use its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/baseus-100w-usb-c-retractable-cable">retractable 100W USB-C cable</a> to charge my daily driver, and it's the only cable I have on my desk. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/baseus-blade-2-power-bank-review">Blade 2</a> is a sleek power bank with good charging potential, and the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/baseus-nomos-140w-charging-station-review">Nomos charging station</a> is an easy recommendation thanks to its integrated Qi 2 charging pad.</p><p>While Baseus is no stranger to power banks, its latest are easily its best yet. The PicoGo Magnetic series is aimed at travel, and it contains the thinnest power banks I've used yet. Baseus has two models available; a 5,000mAh power bank that's just 7.6mm thick, and a 10,000mAh model. The 5,000mAh power bank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Card-Size-Magnetic-Lightweight/dp/B0DYJY2MKS">costs just $26 on Amazon</a>, and it's understandable why it is one of the best-selling power banks on the retailer over the last few months.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FAjT4LpJi7mmcFFjuSnBdP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FAjT4LpJi7mmcFFjuSnBdP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 10,000mAh model is even more interesting, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Portable-Certified-Wireless-10000mAh/dp/B0DY7J8HPQ">comes in at $39 on Amazon</a>. Both power banks have magnetic connectors as standard, and the 10,000mAh model gets Qi 2 integration, giving it an edge in this regard. I've been using both the 5,000mAh and 10,000mAh PicoGo power banks over the course of the last two months, and I like them so much that they're now my go-to choice in everyday use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k9gPt745ie4Wa9dyLiSaPP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9gPt745ie4Wa9dyLiSaPP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's start with the 5,000mAh PicoGo, as its ultra-thin design allows it to be portable like no other power bank. It's thinner than most phones, and at 107g, it is the lightest power bank I used. Baseus sent the grey and pink models, and both designs have aluminum shells that are built to last.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LJCCv4Utfm6h7LjqFR26NP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LJCCv4Utfm6h7LjqFR26NP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design is elegant thanks to smoothly curved sides, and the power bank has strong magnets. It had no issues staying connected to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and even wiggling the phone vigorously didn't dislodge the power bank. There's an LED indicator at the back that shows remaining battery level, and you get a USB-C port at the bottom that lets you charge a secondary device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yPdMkRDbeMzo75cui8PcYP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yPdMkRDbeMzo75cui8PcYP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It charges at 15W via MagSafe and 20W with the USB-C port, but as the power budget is 20W, that's what you get in total when charging two devices simultaneously. And because of the energy transfer, you get about 2,800mAh of usable power out of the 5,000mAh model — that's in line with every other power bank I tested recently.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QA93sAxA4RfJpCXssKSJbP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QA93sAxA4RfJpCXssKSJbP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the 5,000mAh model isn't enough to charge an Android phone fully — it managed to deliver up to 50% to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> — it is a great choice if you're out and about and need a sleek power bank that doesn't add much heft or bulk to your phone. Combine that with the great design and build quality, and attractive color options, and it is about as straightforward a recommendation as I can make with any charging tech.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JbZ8WTqineB8NqqocSicNP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JbZ8WTqineB8NqqocSicNP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you need more power, then the PicoGo 10,000mAh model is a better choice. It has the same design as its smaller sibling, but it's thicker at 12.7mm, and weighs 221g. It's still a manageable heft and size, and the added bonus is that you get Qi 2 charging, going up to 15W. The 10,000mAh model has the same great set of magnets, and although it is heavier, it manages to stay attached to any phone with a magnetic case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9aK3yjM9poJ87ATUKuQDdP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9aK3yjM9poJ87ATUKuQDdP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It has the same design, you can pick it up in the same color options, and it also gets a USB-C port, this time going up to 27W over the PD standard. The only difference between the two models is that the 10,000mAh variant gets Qi 2, and it has double the battery size.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SGHAmJtNZFrHXEtH6hg4hP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SGHAmJtNZFrHXEtH6hg4hP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It even has a similar charging efficiency, so you'll get around 5,600mAh to 5,700mAh of usable power — more than enough to charge most phones fully. While I tend to use bigger power banks, I found the 5,000mAh model to be better-suited to my needs, and even though it doesn't have enough power to fully charge a phone, it gets most devices to at least 60%, and that's enough to last a good chunk of the day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4SfCG97MXWtyjSKZDL2DcP" name="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank" alt="Baseus PicoGo Magnetic Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SfCG97MXWtyjSKZDL2DcP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given the ultra-thin design and lightweight body, I'd suggest getting the 5,000mAh model; it's just convenient to be able to charge your phone if it's running low. And if you need Qi 2, the 10,000mAh PicoGo is a good option to consider. Basically, these are the two best power banks around if you need a thin-and-light design and reliable power delivery.</p>

<p>After teasing the Honor 400 series this week, the company has announced the launch date of the handset models; both products will be unveiled at an event in London on May 22.</p><p>The company has shared a teaser video of the Honor 400 series that reveals the design of both handsets — the Honor 400 and Honor 400 Pro. The company has been teasing about the series for a couple of weeks now, and it is encouraging to see the devices finally getting a launch date.</p>

<p>Honor also emphasizes that the upcoming phones are AI-powered camera phones featuring a 200MP primary lens. It appears the company is heavily relying on bringing all its AI-powered imaging capabilities to the upcoming handsets.</p><p>Coming back to the teaser, it reveals that the Honor 400 has a flat edge design and dual rear cameras. Meanwhile, the Honor 400 Pro is sporting a triple camera system, a sleek form factor with rounded sides and corners.</p>

For instance, the hidden clues indicate the launch date, a good telescope camera with likely AI-powered zoom, and some kind of water resistance and fast charging.</p><p>It is interesting to see the company expanding the Honor 400 series to more regions through the global launch. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/uk/phones/honor-400-lite/">Honor 400 Lite</a> launched last month had a similar approach with the expansion in markets like Europe and the U.K. Meanwhile, the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.honor.com/global/news/honor-300-series-launch-china/">Honor 300 series launch</a> was confined to the Chinese market.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Cuktech is a brand you won't be familiar with; it started out as a white-label manufacturer, and merged with ZMI — a brand in Xiaomi's vast ecosystem — back in 2022. It is now aiming to gain a global presence on the back of interesting launches; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cukteks-40000mah-battery-pack">Cuktech 30</a> is a massive 40000mAh power bank with a 300W power budget and Qi integration, and the model I'm looking at is the Cuktech 15 Ultra, a 20000mAh unit with a 165W power budget.</p><p>The Cuktech 15 Ultra is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CUKTECH-20000mAh-Charger-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0DM1RGZHD">available on Amazon for $87</a> as of writing, and that's on the higher end of the scale, particularly when you consider that UGREEN's Nexode 20000mAh Power Bank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0CXHNGDC1">is selling at $59</a>. That said, the build quality of this power bank is among the best of any I used, and it holds up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-prime-27650mah-250w-power-bank-review">Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank</a> — no small feat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bZwYXQKofiZ4DmKVmmLow3" name="cuktech-15-ultra-3" alt="Cuktech 15 Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bZwYXQKofiZ4DmKVmmLow3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before we get started, a note on the naming; Cuktech says it chose its name because of the Čuk DC-DC converter architecture, named after Slobodan Čuk. With that out of the way, let's talk about the design. Similar to Anker and UGREEN, Cuktech went with a vertical profile for the power bank, and it is absolutely the right move — it makes the 15 Ultra that much more portable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KJa8y6GLYKPiGgFqXVwry3" name="cuktech-15-ultra-15" alt="Cuktech 15 Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KJa8y6GLYKPiGgFqXVwry3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are other niceties; the grey color scheme with the black front looks clean, and the back has a textured finish that makes it easy to hold the power bank. I don't have any issues with the design of the 15 Ultra, and Cuktech did a good job in this regard.</p>

<p>There's a button up front that activates the panel, and you get to see battery life, time to charge devices, and real-time charging metrics on the same page. Ideally, Cuktech should have pushed the real-time charging details to a secondary page as it makes the panel look a little cluttered, but that's a minor quibble. You get all the information you need, and that's what ultimately matters.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wDYcc2xiwr9rdgCSWyqn34" name="cuktech-15-ultra-9" alt="Cuktech 15 Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wDYcc2xiwr9rdgCSWyqn34.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As it contains a 72Wh battery, there are no issues taking the 15 Ultra onboard a flight. The 20000mAh size is adequate to charge your phone a few times over along with a few accessories, and charging efficiency is in line with other brands I tested recently.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WidH88zLTd6tWsYXvUPAy3" name="cuktech-15-ultra-18" alt="Cuktech 15 Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WidH88zLTd6tWsYXvUPAy3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, you can't charge a phone with a 5000mAh battery four times with the 15 Ultra; the inherent energy loss while using the power bank means it has an efficiency of just under 60%, so you'll reasonably get 12000mAh of charging potential. This is the case with all power banks, so you're not missing out with the 15 Ultra when it comes to charging your tech.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4a5BdVsiuwNDYqsVXKSnx3" name="cuktech-15-ultra-7" alt="Cuktech 15 Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4a5BdVsiuwNDYqsVXKSnx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the power bank has three ports in total — two USB-C and a USB-A connector. The main USB-C port goes up to 140W over the USB PD 3.1 standard, and the secondary USB-C hits 65W. The USB-A port is limited to 18W, so it can only be used with accessories. With both USB-C ports in use, you get a 165W power budget. I'm sharing a rundown of the power profiles, and how the 15 Ultra handles simultaneous charging:</p>
<ul><li><strong>USB-C1 in/out (140W max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W), 28V/5A (140W)</li><li><strong>USB-C2 out (65W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3.25A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-A out (18W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/2A (18W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + USB-C2 out (165W max):</strong> 100W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + USB-A (118W max):</strong> 100W + 18W</li><li><strong>USB-C2 + USB-A (83W max):</strong> 65W + 18W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + USB-C2 + USB-A (163W max):</strong> 100W + 45W + 18W</li></ul>

<p>I used the 15 Ultra with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="Vivo X200 Pro">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and it did a reliable job charging these devices. There's no overheating either, and Cuktech did a good job with thermal management in general.</p><p>Ultimately, the 15 Ultra stands out because of its polished design and reliable charging potential. Although Cuktech is a recent entrant to global markets, it clearly knows what it's doing in this area.</p>

<hr>
<p>The date is set!</p><p>Putting all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-tipped-for-may-debut-new-leak-claims">launch rumors</a> to rest, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">multiple teases later,</a> Samsung announced today (May 7) that the fourth variant of the Galaxy S25 series will be unveiled through a virtual Galaxy Unpacked event. The Galaxy S25 Edge is set to drop on May 12 at 8 p.m. ET, and the entire launch will be live-streamed via the OEM's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ca/">official website</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/samsung">YouTube channel</a>.</p><p>The device is being advertised with the tagline "Beyond Slim: Discover Unprecedented Innovation with Galaxy S25 Edge. " It is said to be both a powerful AI companion and an engineering marvel that combines flagship specifications while being light to carry around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3801px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5FeTFYje2z29mH34VfNcV4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-MWC-2025-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge on display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5FeTFYje2z29mH34VfNcV4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3801" height="2138" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the tagline suggests, the phone is more than just a slim device; it is set out to create a premium user experience. "Every curve, contour, and component reflects a breakthrough in precise engineering," the press release stated.</p><p>While Samsung didn't reveal much of the specs of the device, the press release did focus a lot on the Galaxy S25 Edge's camera. Stating that the device is set out to give users an "ultimate camera experience." As rumors suggested, the Galaxy S25 Edge will indeed show up with a 200 MP wide camera. The company also stated that this lens will be integrated with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, which will transform it into a smart lens, "that helps recognize what matters to create new memories."</p><p>While Samsung has teased the phone several times leading up to the launch, it is saving the rest of the specs for D-day. However, with several leaks floating around, we have a good idea of what to expect from this phone.</p>

After using the Powerbeats Pro 2 for months, they're undoubtedly my favorite Android earbuds to date.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cyd6yTNNqLifPvgwWhGYEE" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-2" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cyd6yTNNqLifPvgwWhGYEE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-pro">big fan of the original Powerbeats Pro</a>, but I'll be the first to admit that they weren't great for everyday wear. They were workout-first earbuds in a form factor that was too bulky and uncomfortable for daily use. Although it took Beats six years to release a new iteration of Powerbeats Pro, the Powerbeats Pro 2 were worth the wait. They directly addressed my concerns, making the latest version well-equipped for everyday use.</p><p>The changes start with a slimmer, more compact form factor — and that goes for both the buds themselves and their charging case. The Powerbeats Pro 2 still have ear hooks, although the new versions are sleeker and follow the natural curvature of your ear. That means, if you choose the right color, they won't look out of place in an office building or coffee shop.</p>

<p>Another reason they're perfect for daily use now is their newfound support for active noise-canceling and transparency mode. The previous generation of Powerbeats Pro were <em>too good</em> at passive sound isolation, meaning I couldn't hold a conversation with the person next to me or order a coffee without taking them out entirely. Now, you get Apple's full suite of ANC modes, meaning you can keep Powerbeats Pro 2 in your ear while having a full conversation or hearing background noise.</p><p>Battery and charging is improved too, as you can get up to 10 hours from the earbuds themselves and up to 45 total hours with the charging case. In other words, you can use Powerbeats Pro 2 during an intercontinental flight without ever needing to pop them into their charging case. Or, you can use the earbuds throughout a week of work (and workouts) without powering up the case.</p><p>When you do need to charge the Powerbeats Pro 2 case, you have a USB-C port and wireless charging options to do so.</p>

<p>That was enough to sway me into making the Powerbeats Pro 2 my daily driver, as they're fully-featured across my Macs, Windows PCs, iPhone, and Android phones.</p><p>However, if you're looking for even more value, the fact that Powerbeats Pro 2 have an individual heart rate sensor in each earbud could be the differentiating factor. It's using a version of the same technology found in the Apple Watch, and can monitor your heart rate during workouts without needing a separate device.</p><p>Put simply, I think these are a better set of earbuds than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a> — two great pairs of Android earbuds — at a now-affordable price of just under $200. They're staying in my ears for the foreseeable future, after I used their predecessor for runs for a full six years.</p>

<p>Clicks Cases' Head of Marketing, Jeffery Gadway, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jeffgadway_ive-been-keeping-this-a-secret-but-i-can-activity-7325900777485488128-M_KF" target="_blank">posted</a> on his LinkedIn page that Best Buy will now give away a free Clicks keyboard with every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr 2025</a> pre-order.</p><p>Attaching a poster for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-512gb-unlocked-pantone-mountain-trail/6625232.p?skuId=6625232">Best Buy promotion</a>, Gadaway said that the Clicks for Razr has quickly become the most popular physical keyboard for Android smartphones. He noted that this is a huge milestone for a company that began just 18 months ago, to be bundled up with one of the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on"> best flip phones</a> on the market.</p><p>Just a day after the series launched, Clicks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/clicks-keyboard-moto-razr-ultra-2025-combo-launch">revealed</a> a new case that is compatible with the Razr Ultra 2025. The new Clicks keyboard "builds on the hype" the company experienced when it launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-clicks-keyboard-for-my-motorola-razr-can-turn-my-phone-into-what-ive-been-missing">Razr</a>/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-just-crashed-well-below-its-black-friday-price-but-theres-a-catch">Razr Plus 2024</a> version.</p>

<p>According to Gadway, customers who have Clicks cases can be more productive with the pocketable flip phone. Much like AC's Jerry Hildenbrand, who isn't much of an accessories guy, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-clicks-keyboard-for-my-motorola-razr-can-turn-my-phone-into-what-ive-been-missing">quickly became a fan </a>of the Clicks for Razr, even before he got his hands on one.</p><p>To use this nostalgia-inducing case, all you have to do is quickly slot the Razr Ultra into the case and use its keyboard on its cover display, or open it and use it in a more practical scenario. Clicks says its back-lit keys are designed to be "ergonomic" and "contoured," giving users an old-school typing experience on their new phones.</p><p>"By moving the virtual keyboard off the screen, you can tackle typing tasks like email, texts, and instant messages without needing to flip the Razr open," Gadway explained in his post.</p><p>The Clicks case for the Razr Ultra only comes in the Onyx, "off-black" colorway, while the existing Clicks Razr 2024 cases will support the standard Razr and Razr Plus 2025.</p><p>That said, this is a limited-time offer valid on pre-orders of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Motorola Razr 2025 series</a> starting today until June 1 or until supplies last, as stated in the promo poster.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster claims to have discovered an early build for Samsung's Wear OS update, One UI 8 Watch, which reportedly holds clues about Gemini.</li><li>Gemini is expected in Wear OS in the future and this leak shines a light on its "actions" and the ability to manage scheduled events and more.</li><li>A previous report saw some users notice Gemini's logo appear on Wear OS in the Assistant app, but nothing further was discovered.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Additional information about Google's AI model coming to Wear OS surface, but this time, it's Samsung's One UI in the spotlight.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/one-ui-8-watch-wear-os-gemini-3555155/">Android Authority</a> highlight a discovery made on X by tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DevOfIpos/status/1919828862088671433">IposDev</a> that reportedly furthers our expectations about Gemini in Wear OS. According to the tipster, they've uncovered an early One UI 8 Watch build, which the publication states contains better insight into how Google's Gemini will function on wearables.</p><p>In its teardown, many strings in the APK point toward Gemini's varied uses for users in their daily lives. A more interesting string directly states "Add a Gemini action." Its code states this could appear as a chip in Samsung's Wear OS skin.</p><p>Elsewhere, the points toward a few of Gemini's uses, like the ability for users to command it to "move my next meeting 30mins later." Other strings highlight things we're familiar with: email summarization and weather reports. However, this code prominently features the word "suggestion," as if the AI will offer its own take on what users should do next with the information it provides. It's probably safe to say these suggestions will appear as small cards to tap, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Moreover, these functions are suspected to be available to users and their vocal commands.</p>

<p>At the start of May, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-assistant-gemini-changes-screen-spotted">a report</a> regarding a tipster's social media post detailed the sudden (small) Gemini cameo on a Galaxy Watch 4. The tipster stated Gemini's diamond/starry logo appeared when launching the Assistant; however, the latter still held control over its core functionality. There was another instance where Gemini's logo appeared in Wear OS' app list instead of the Assistant's.</p><p>We've known since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-may-soon-get-gemini">the beginning of 2025</a>, following a teardown, that Google was seemingly inching toward fully replacing the Assistant in Wear OS with Gemini. Soon after, in March, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-on-wear-os-sounds-an-awful-lot-like-google-assistant">Google confirmed</a> everyone's suspicions. During that time, an APK dive unearthed various pieces of text, like "Gemini is now on your watch" and "Get started with Gemini." For a wristbound helper, Gemini's support for voice prompts/queries will likely feel like the Assistant, but with better smarts and understanding for complex commands.</p><p>Early findings suggest users will be able to surface Gemini by saying "Hey Google" aloud.</p><p>The "good" thing here is that Google's I/O 2025 event is right around the corner on May 20 at 10 am PT. The company recently teased "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-io-2025-newsletter-teasers">new possibilities</a>" en route to the event, which concern a few Gemini updates. With so much regarding Gemini in Wear OS coming to light, perhaps we'll have more to dig into later this month.</p>

<ul><li>Pixel Watch's companion app is finally rocking a light theme after years of all-black vibes.</li><li>There's no switch in the app settings, meaning it’s a quiet server-side update from Google.</li><li>Google has been lightening things up lately, with Pixel Studio getting the same treatment in March.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s Pixel Watch app is stepping into the light—literally.</p><p>After years of dark-mode dominance, the companion app for one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">leading smartwatch models</a> is finally getting a light theme, and it’s not just a simple palette swap.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/05/06/pixel-watch-app-light-theme/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the update is rolling out via a server-side update to the Pixel Watch app on Android, giving users the option to switch from moody blacks to crisp whites.</p><p>Over the past few days, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch</a> owners over on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1kg9w9t/light_theme/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> have noticed the app adopting a light background. What’s interesting is there’s no built-in theme toggle, and since the last app update (version 3.4) arrived back in April, it looks like Google quietly flipped the switch on its end with a server-side rollout.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:392px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:195.41%;"><img id="KBAYEurLfhAQNM9tLXBiXM" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-app" alt="Pixel Watch app with light theme" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KBAYEurLfhAQNM9tLXBiXM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="392" height="766" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NicolasDK / Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="not-syncing-with-your-phone-s-theme-2">Not syncing with your phone’s theme</h2>
<p>Some users on Reddit speculated that the app might be syncing with the phone's system-wide theme settings. But so far, there’s no official word to back that up, and early testing kind of shuts that theory down.</p><p>This update follows similar moves by Google, such as introducing a light theme to Pixel Studio in March. That said, some apps like Clock are still sticking to their all-dark vibe, as per 9to5.</p>
<h2 id="watch-os-update-coming-soon-2">Watch OS update coming soon?</h2>
<p>While the Pixel Watch app has embraced a lighter look, the watch itself is still awaiting its next OS update, expected in June. There's speculation about the introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, potentially based on Android 16, at the upcoming Google I/O 2025.</p><p>However, since there’s no developer session lined up for it yet, chances are the Pixel Watch will stick with its current Android 15-based setup for a little while longer.</p>

<p>I'm not that guy who keeps up with the sales and prices of everything, but I know I should be; saving money is always the best way to buy anything. What I do pay attention to is companies that build something consumer-friendly and different, something that stands out from the rest of the pack.</p><p>That's what the HMD Skyline does. It's a good midrange phone with all the amenities you expect from one, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">one special feature you don't find very often</a>: an easy way to open it up and do something like replace the battery or display. This is what makes me love this phone. It's also the first (and so far, only) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-does-not-require-magnets">Qi2</a> Android phone with built-in MagSafe if that interests you.</p><p>Yes, yes, you can spend a lot more and buy something a lot more powerful or with a better camera. Just don't break the screen, or you'll pay even more for an expensive replacement. With the Skyline, you can use one screwdriver and a guitar pick to follow a simple set of instructions to do that yourself. And yes, you can do it yourself; it's that easy.</p>

<p>It's not a perfect phone because that doesn't exist. In particular, I have issues with the fact that you'll only be slated to receive two years of official support for a phone you can potentially keep using for a lot longer, but that's just me. I know most people are more than ready to buy something new after two years.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that this is the North American version, listed as officially supported by AT&T, T-Mobile, Cricket, and Tracfone. It could work on other networks, but you need to know what you're buying ,even though it's on sale.</p><p>If you're not worried about having a phone that can boast about its specs, and want the peace of mind that comes with knowing a busted screen isn't going to have you buying another one, this is a phone I can recommend to a lot of people.</p>

<hr>
<p>Netflix executives sat down to announce the beginning of a new TV experience that's preparing to roll out for all members.</p><p>In its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/unveiling-our-innovative-new-tv-experience">announcement</a>, Netflix states, "In the coming months," all of its users will receive its newly updated homepage when viewing the platform on a TV. The company's chief product officer, Eunice Kim, stated Netflix wanted the redesign to be "more flexible for our broad entertainment offerings, more intuitive and responsive to our members’ needs."</p><p>What users should prepare to find is an "elevated" Netflix experience on TVs. The company states it reworked its homepage with a "clean and modern" design. Joining these changes is a brighter spotlight on the information that matters for shows and movies. The post says users should find everything they need "front and center" to make an informed decision before interacting.</p><p>Netflix content will feature tags, like "Emmy Award Winner," "#1 in TV Shows," "Recently Added," "New Season," and more.</p><p>The UI is also seeing some TLC, as Netflix says key shortcuts for "My List" and Search will move to the top of your display. Lastly, experience progresses with better real-time recommendations.</p>

<p>The smartphone Netflix experience gets a little love, too, as the company discussed new ways to search and discover. Regarding the former, Netflix will incorporate generative AI to enable the use of "conversational language" when searching. For example, the platform says a user could write "I want something funny and upbeat," and its AI software should narrow things down.</p><p>This feature will arrive as an opt-in beta for iOS users first.</p><p>Additionally, Netflix is preparing to introduce a vertical feed "in the coming weeks." This feed will contain clips of its available shows and movies to (hopefully) entice users into watching. If there is something that catches your eye, Netflix says users can tap to watch that bit of content seamlessly.</p><p>Interestingly, we've seen Netflix <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-highlights-smart-tv-home-screen-changes">testing similar changes</a> around this time last year. The company's senior director of product, Pat Flemming, discussed these changes in an interview, stating, the changes should help users cut down on the "gymnastics they do with their eyes." Another change is how cards for shows and movies are offered. When hovered over, these cards will expand to display a quick teaser or preview of what you can expect.</p><p>The test was extremely limited last year, but Netflix is in a place now where it's comfortable enough to roll it out officially for members.</p>

One of my favorite Android phones (and one that I personally bought with a <em>painfully </em>inferior discount) is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HX5ZB7"><strong>now selling for as low as $799.99 through the retailer, with the 512GB version chilling at 25% off.</strong></a> The Pixel 9 Pro has only hit this record low price once before, so don&apos;t make the same mistake I did and buy now if you&apos;re interested. </p>
<div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9701f0f0-d7a5-4b9c-8992-acf1cf533322" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,219" data-dimension48="$1,219" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HX5ZB7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Y6BjeqA5JUC8RJeo9rnUrA" name="Google Pixel 9 Pro" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y6BjeqA5JUC8RJeo9rnUrA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>💲<em>Record Low Price Alert</em> 💲<br>
<strong>Google Pixel 9 Pro 512GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HX5ZB7/" data-dimension112="9701f0f0-d7a5-4b9c-8992-acf1cf533322" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,219" data-dimension48="$1,219"><del>$1,219</del> <strong>$919 at Amazon</strong></a></p>
<p>Head to Amazon and buy the Google Pixel 9 Pro with a 512GB storage configuration and you'll get a whopping 25% slashed off your purchase. That's a record low price that the phone has only touched once before, so don't wait too long if you're interested.</p>
<p>If you don't need that much storage, you'll also be happy to learn that the 128GB and 256GB versions of the phone are receiving 20% and 23% discounts, respectively, while the epic 1TB configuration is currently 21% off through Amazon's site. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HX5ZB7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9701f0f0-d7a5-4b9c-8992-acf1cf533322" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,219" data-dimension48="$1,219">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>We gave the Google Pixel 9 Pro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">a glowing 4/5-star review</a> back when the flagship lineup was revealed late last year, and it isn&apos;t hard to see why. The phone boasts a stunning 6.3-inch OLED display that&apos;s simply a joy to use in any light, while under the hood you get 16GB of RAM, the ultra-efficient Tensor G4 processor, and all of the latest AI-boosted software features. As usual with Google phones, the Pixel 9 Pro&apos;s cameras are truly exceptional, plus you get superb haptics and seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. </p><p>That being said, Pixel phones have a reputation for being relatively inefficient when it comes to gaming, and while I&apos;ve never had any issues with simple side-scrollers or puzzle apps, you might want to look for a different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming phone</a> if you play graphics-intensive titles like Genshin Impact. You might also have a problem with the Pixel 9 Pro if you&apos;re sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM flicker</a>, so consider doing a little research on that if you&apos;ve had issues before. </p><p>Aside from those few faults, the Google Pixel 9 Pro is an excellent daily driver that I use for just about everything, from streaming TV shows and films to capturing photos and video in 4K resolution.

<ul><li>Sony has confirmed that its next product launch will involve its Xperia smartphone line, which seemingly points toward the expected Xperia 1 VII.</li><li>The company states its launch event will kick off on May 13 at 11 am JST (May 12 at 10 PM ET).</li><li>Leaks from April suggest the Xperia 1 VII will look largely similar to the Xperia 1 VI with a 6.5-inch display, a triple camera array, and a 5,000mAh battery.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you've been waiting for the next big thing from Sony, you're in luck because the company's new product launch is coming up fast.</p><p>Sony's Xperia page on X <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/sonyxperia/status/1920036311575974057">posted official confirmation</a> of a "new product announcement" toward the middle of May (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_officially_reveals_the_xperia_1_viis_launch_date_and_its_close-news-67670.php">GSMArena</a>). The company doesn't offer much of a device teaser; however, it's clear by the name and the included photo that we're expecting a smartphone reveal. Sony states the reveal will take place on May 13 at 11 am JST (May 12 at 10 PM ET).</p><p>The company links users to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4vO4znaDPg&ab_channel=Sony%7CXperia">YouTube Premier</a> set for next week, which gives us a little more to think about.</p><p>Accompanied by the "Next ONE is coming" tagline, Sony displays the outline of its next Xperia with one of its cameras. The close-up highlights the camera's FE 1.2/50mm lens before rolling into a few shots of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-vi-launch">Xperia 1 VI. </a>The teaser seemingly alludes to more camera enhancements with the expected Xperia 1 VII, stating, "True Quality. Real Emotions."</p>
<h2 id="a-few-xperia-leaks-2">A few Xperia leaks</h2>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Xperia is coming on 13 May!Get ready for the Xperia New Product Announcement, exclusively on @SonyXperia YouTube: https://t.co/FrBWgOMjcq13 May (TUE), 2025 11:00 Japan time / 04:00 CEST#SonyXperia #ProductAnnouncement #NextXperia<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1920036311575974057">May 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>With the Xperia 1 VII around the corner, it's time to take a look back at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-vii-renders-leak-revealing-device-design">few leaks from April</a> that might bring its offerings into perspective. To start, the phone's renderings seemingly surfaced, showcasing a design language similar to its predecessor, the Xperia 1 VI. However, the upcoming model looks slightly taller in its renders, and with a couple of noticeable chins above and below its display.</p><p>Thinner bezels line the sides, but the larger chins might be something to get used to if true.</p><p>Its supposed specifications include a 6.5-inch display with a purported 19.5:9 aspect ratio. Sony is expected to implement Android 15 in the Xperia 1 VII, as well as a 5,000mAh battery with 30W wired charging capabilities. The phone is said to feature a dedicated camera button along its right edge, with a volume rocker and power button.</p><p>A triple camera array is expected on its rear panel, like its past-gen version. Specs for those lenses weren't detailed; however, the Xperia 1 VI offered a 50MP primary camera, a 12MP telephoto, and a 12MP ultrawide.</p><p>AI was at the center of Sony's last Xperia, and it seems like we can expect more of the same this year, too. One of its main features was AF tracking with "human pose estimation." The device could track the human body and track it with "precision" even through objects.</p>

Its latest product is the Flash Pro Ultra, a 25000mAh power bank that lets you charge up to six devices at once. As someone who has way too many power banks, I wanted to take a look at the Flash Pro Ultra, and see how it holds up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-prime-27650mah-250w-power-bank-review">Anker's Prime 27650mAh</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-25000mah-power-bank-review">UGREEN Nexode 25000mAh power banks</a>.</p><p>The Flash Pro Ultra secured over $400,000 in crowdsourced funding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/asaptechnologies/flash-pro-ultra">via Kickstarter</a>, and it is now doing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flash-pro-ultra-1st-275w-powerbank-w-oled-screen#/">another round on Indiegogo</a> if you're interested. Chargeasap is selling the power bank at $179, which it says is a 46% discount over the $329 retail pricing. As an overview, Anker's Prime 27650mAh power bank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG">retails for $179 on Amazon</a>, and the UGREEN Nexode 25000mAh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-25000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0CXHM5RY2">is down to $99</a>.</p>

<p>Power banks have gotten sleeker in the last two years, but that isn't the case with the Flash Pro Ultra; it has a utilitarian design and is considerably bigger than most 25000mAh power banks I used recently. It is made out of plastic, but the build quality doesn't feel quite as robust as recent Anker and UGREEN options.</p>

<p>Coming in at 596g, it is the same weight as the UGREEN Nexode 25000mAh power bank, but as it doesn't have a vertical design, it isn't as portable. The upside is that you get additional charging ports; there's a 15W MagSafe charging puck at the front, and a dedicated pad to charge the Apple Watch or Samsung Watch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GZkRyiRseKJHYrLgfobPrQ" name="chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-5" alt="Chargeasap Flash Pro Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GZkRyiRseKJHYrLgfobPrQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Annoyingly, I got the variant that charges the Samsung Watch, so I wasn't able to test it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch/i-used-the-apple-watch-series-10-for-six-months-heres-why-its-still-the-best-smartwatch">Apple Watch Series 10</a>. Chargeasap sends out a survey to all backers asking about the model of choice, so if you're interested in this power bank, know that you can choose between the two.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HRkMJY7KoBdGVdo5sH8MrQ" name="chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-12" alt="Chargeasap Flash Pro Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HRkMJY7KoBdGVdo5sH8MrQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 15W Qi charging pad sits flush with the body, but it pops out should you need to use it. I tested it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and it did a decent enough job. The magnet is strong enough that it doesn't dislodge the phone, and my only worry in this area is the durability of the mechanism; there were instances where the pad didn't pop out fully, and I had to push it back in and try again.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t3XuB53ht92KsF5UomyhnQ" name="chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-11" alt="Chargeasap Flash Pro Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t3XuB53ht92KsF5UomyhnQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a tiny OLED panel that shows battery level, thermals, and time left to charge connected devices, and a second press of the button on the side shows real-time charging details. The panel gets adequately bright, and I didn't see any issues viewing the text while outdoors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="drifxVYjVsTigpSCUKWinQ" name="chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-15" alt="Chargeasap Flash Pro Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/drifxVYjVsTigpSCUKWinQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power bank has a glossy finish that picks up smudges with relative ease, and the sides have a grooved design that makes it a little easier to hold. You get three USB-C ports alongside one USB-A, with the main USB-C port able to hit 140W. The USB-C2 port does 100W, and USB-C3 maxes out at 60W, just like the USB-A connector.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MM4eKtkdJf82ZmdniGSkkQ" name="chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-6" alt="Chargeasap Flash Pro Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MM4eKtkdJf82ZmdniGSkkQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the Flash Pro Ultra is branded as a 275W power bank, it doesn't actually hit that figure; in my testing, I found it go up to 200W while charging several devices at once, and the key advantage you're getting with the device is the ability to charge up to six devices at once. Most other power banks in this category have three ports as standard, so you're essentially getting increased flexibility when it comes to charging all your gear.</p>

<p>As it has a 90.75Wh battery, there are no issues taking the power bank onboard a flight — it's under the 100Wh limit enforced by most countries. It did just as well at charging various devices as the UGREEN Nexode alternative, and I didn't see any issues using it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, and a dozen or so accessories.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4iEJkPh5PAQkCA28C4UZsQ" name="chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-4" alt="Chargeasap Flash Pro Ultra power bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4iEJkPh5PAQkCA28C4UZsQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the whole, I like the convenience on offer with the Flash Pro Ultra; it is easily able to charge more devices than its immediate rivals, and the inclusion of a 15W charging pad is a decent differentiator. That said, the build quality isn't as good, and I don't know how the product holds up over long-term use. I've had it for just over a month now, and while I didn't see any issues outside of the charging pad getting stuck, it doesn't have the same rugged durability of the Nexode 25000mAh power bank.</p>

<ul><li>Honor Magic 7 Pro gets access to Android 16 Beta 3 and test run, and see what this new OS feels like on their phones.</li><li>The company put out a detailed guide for developers and advanced users who'd like to test out the new software.</li><li>Honor cautions that this is not for general users and says that there's a low probability of the phone restarting in some scenarios once it is updated.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor announced today that those with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> device will be able to experience <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> Beta 3 as it has been made available for developers. In an email to Android Central,  the company added that the HONOR Magic7 Pro is one of the first phones globally to support this preview.</p><p>The company added that this Android 16 Beta 3 preview will give developers early access to new features and performance of the OS, firsthand. It will also give them access to new APIs and tools that could help developers fine-tune the user experience before the stable version of the OS is officially launched later in June.</p>

<p>That said, it should be noted that Pixel phones are currently on<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-drops-android-16-beta-4-before-the-big-stable-launch-in-may"> Android 16 Beta 4</a>, but this is the first Android 16 beta version available for the Honor's Magic 7 Pro.</p><p>"This marks another milestone in HONOR’s close collaboration with Google. HONOR was also among the first to roll out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> Beta 1 in 2024 for the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review"> Magic 6 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2,</a>" the company said in an email.</p><p>Furthermore, in a detailed post, the company laid out steps for developers to safely upgrade their phones. And if you are a general user, the company recommends that you wait until the official stable launch of the OS later this year.</p><p>Developers who plan on installing the Beta version can do so through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.honor.com/en/tg/android16">Honor's official page</a>, which has the upgrade package uploaded onto the website. All that you need to do is download the corresponding upgrade package based on your device. Make sure adb, Python environment, and Honor Suite are available for PC. Secondly, developers need to have more than 60GB of space on their phones.</p>

<p>Following this, go to <strong>Settings > About phone</strong>, tap <strong>Build number</strong> seven times to enable developer mode, then go to <strong>System & updates > Developer options</strong> to enable <strong>USB debugging</strong> and connect the device to PC via USB cable.  The next steps are detailed in Honor's blog post.</p><p>Lastly, the OEM notes that this upgrade will not erase any data, and recommends that you back up your phone beforehand.</p><p>"The upgraded new system adopts a brand new user partition, which is not shared with the original one, and the data of the original user partition is unavailable on the new system," the company added.</p>

<p>Instagram is playing around with a new way to lock down Reels using a secret code, maybe even with a hint to help out. The company has teamed up with The Weeknd to roll it out for the first time and see how it plays.</p><p>This new feature gives creators a cool way to boost engagement with their content. It also lets artists and influencers drop exclusive short videos just for their fans—the ones sharp enough to crack the clue.</p><p>To kick things off, The Weeknd is dropping an unreleased sneak peek from his upcoming clip Hurry Up Tomorrow using the new secret-code Reels. The hint to crack the code is "CLEAN TITLE FOR TRACK 3."</p>
<h2 id="hype-machine-2">Hype machine</h2>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/instagram">Instagram</a> is toying with this new feature to help creators stir up buzz and drop content that feels more like a secret club.</p><p>The Meta-owned social network has been quietly experimenting with the feature on its Design account.</p><p>This new feature also gives creators and brands a fun way to kick off promos or marketing campaigns. Hidden Reels could be perfect for teasing new products or building buzz around an upcoming drop.</p>

<p>For everyday users, this feature offers a nifty way to share content only with a select group of friends.</p>
<h2 id="been-here-before-2">Been here before?</h2>
<p>This isn’t Instagram’s first rodeo with exclusive content. It is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/05/new-stickers-in-instagram-stories/" target="_blank">reminiscent of its “Reveal” Stories feature</a> from last year. With those, you could post a hidden Story that only unlocked if followers hit you up directly. It aims to spark closer connections and get people more involved.</p><p>Locked Reels could offer regular users a fun, more private way to share with close friends. But not everyone might be into dealing with secret codes, especially with how busy and info-packed the platform already is.</p><p>This feature is just another addition to Instagram’s toolbox of interactive tricks, but whether it’ll really take off is anybody's guess.</p>

<h2 id="you-need-a-good-id-vault-more-than-ever-2">You need a good ID vault more than ever</h2>
<p>A new feature for Android was announced, and it's likely that most people didn't notice or care about it: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-enhances-digital-credentials-access-with-androids-open-standards-support">on-device support for OpenID standards</a>.</p><p>It makes sense; this sounds like a really nerdy thing that nobody asked for and you have no intentions of using, but it's not. Well, OK, not very many people asked for it, but only because they had no idea it existed or that it was needed. We do need it, and you will end up using it.</p>
<p>How this all works is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/identity/digital-credentials/credential-verifier" target="_blank">a rabbit hole of tech</a> that is really difficult to understand completely, but easy to see the high-level picture.</p><p>You'll enter a form of verified digital ID, like a driver's license or a passport, into a wallet app. This app uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html" target="_blank">OpenID open-source standards</a> to ensure it's secure — plenty of eyes are on its code and actively trying to break it. It will never be 100% foolproof because nothing ever is, but it's pretty secure.</p><p>That app doesn't need to do anything other than be a place to store these credentials. In fact, I'd say that's all it should ever do because that's a really important thing. Think of it as a big, heavy-duty bank vault to hold your ID.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mtV4A7b79jaWGYJCzwSLeW" name="Add passport to Google Wallet" alt="Add passport to Google Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mtV4A7b79jaWGYJCzwSLeW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When another app needs to verify who you are, examples given include Amazon, CVS, or Uber. You pick your ID from the list, and that ID vault app sends the relevant details securely between them. You don't have to take a photo of anything or send a copy of your driver's license to Amazon, or anything else. The app knows who to ask (the Digital Wallet, or ID vault) and knows what to do with the information it is given.</p><p>All this is done on your phone, it's all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-googles-backup-encryption-works-good-bad-and-ugly">encrypted</a>, and it's surely going to be easy to wipe all details if you need to do it.</p><p>All you have to do is enter your ID into the right app, and the rest is done for you. Normally, I don't like it when things happen automatically, but this is not one of those times. I know if done properly, this system will do a much better job of keeping my identity secure than I ever could. My only problem is making the right choice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XHbi4ptDLYz9wvFDtaMDQZ" name="Google-Wallet-logo-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024" alt="The Google Wallet logo on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XHbi4ptDLYz9wvFDtaMDQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The problem isn't really a problem: regular users (that'd be you and me) don't need to know about any of this for it to be effective. We can just use it and benefit without knowing any better. But that means we either need Google to act in a very walled-garden way and act as a gatekeeper for which developers can use it and how, or we have to make the right choice.</p><p>The first isn't likely to happen and probably shouldn't happen. Companies like Google and Apple control the mobile phone market, and giving them even more power <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-sues-google-and-samsung-anti-competitive-case">is a bad idea</a>. In Google's case, with an enormous amount of leverage worldwide through Android, it's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-be-forced-to-split-up-chrome-and-android-over-antitrust-concerns"><em>very</em> bad idea</a>.</p><p>That means you have to be able to trust someone. So, who to trust?</p>
<p>That's tricky. The only thing I trust a tech company to do is things that benefit it. Having said that, I know that you can trust a company like Google (or Apple, if you use an iPhone) or Samsung because they have too much to lose if they screw it up. Google says 1Password is also going to incorporate this more secure "ID vault" feature as well, and we can probably trust them, too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3375px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="X7hXneZDSgYkAMBeaPL3ii" name="android-digital-credentials-selection-interface" alt="Android Digital Credentials selection interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X7hXneZDSgYkAMBeaPL3ii.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3375" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Who you <strong>can't</strong> trust is the better way to think about it. There could be a development team out there that can do this so much better than Google or Samsung ever will. There could also be people who just want to make a quick buck, do the very basics, then stop caring. Until you can determine which is which, <strong>you can't trust either</strong>.</p>
<p>I know that's awfully cynical and a little unfair. I don't care, and neither should you.</p><p>When that amazing app that does a great job hits the scene, a lot of eyes will be on it. The right people will look at it, and they'll tell you if it's as great as claimed or if it's just a dud. You need to let those right people have a long, hard look and trust them, knowing they know a lot more about this than we do. Unless, of course, you are one of those right people; if so, make sure to tell the rest of us what you think, OK?</p><p>When everything is finally squared away and this is how we handle identity verification in the future (I think it will happen and know it <em>needs</em> to happen), do the smart thing. Install <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallets-installment-payments-and-tap-to-send-features-show-up-in-the-app">Samsung Wallet</a> and use it. Don't be tempted by something with a fancy UI or shiny bits until someone tells you you should.</p>

The specs are spectacular, but that's no secret. What's not being talked about as much as it should, however, is the diverse offering of textures and colors. We need to appreciate the many shapes and forms of all three devices.</p><p>You can have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025</a> made of wood or one with a nylon-like woven fabric backside. Then there's the marvelous, luxurious marble imitation that oozes opulence and grandeur. It truly is a sensory delight.</p><p>Motorola is innovating the tactile sense of a phone.</p>

<h2 id="motorola-acknowledges-the-public-s-desire-for-fun-and-unique-designs-2">Motorola acknowledges the public's desire for fun and unique designs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola is clearly having fun doing things its own way, just like the brand always has. In a world where Google is taking a leaf out of Samsung's bland book to give us the bar of soap that is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a>, Motorola is rebelling. It's such a legendary move, to be honest. I'd expect nothing less from the makers of the most iconic flip phone in the history of technology.</p><p>The Razr 2025 lineup consists of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Razr 2025, Razr Plus 2025, and Razr Ultra 2025</a>. The first and last models come in four colorways each, whereas the middle child is available in three finishes.</p><p>Motorola collaborated with Pantone to curate colors for every single color variant, and then meticulously decided to pair those shades with the right materials and finishes. The attention to detail and dedication to ensure that each variant is on the Pantone scale of standardized colors is admirable.</p><p>Leather-backed smartphones aren't new, and many brands like Xiaomi and OnePlus have colorways that offer this texture for their flagship phones. But there's usually one "unusual" option along with two or three other commonplace finishes like plastic or glass on the roster. With the Razr family, every single option brings something different to the table.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-what-breaking-the-mold-looks-like-2">This is what breaking the mold looks like</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q4uD6JrUXYHyJc2Us5C4se" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-17" alt="Different colors of the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q4uD6JrUXYHyJc2Us5C4se.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Introducing three phones in one go is already a risk, but offering four individual colors with unique textures for two of the three models is a big gamble. And it's not your average vegan leather, either—the Razr 2025 series comes in some seriously uncommon finishes.</p><p>For instance, there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/what-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-color-should-you-buy">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 colorway</a> in Scarab that's made of Alcantara, the stuff used to line the insides of a Porche or Ferrari. They could've used any other type of synthetic material to get that soft matte look, but Alcantara is a high-grade material that offers improved durability and longevity. Not to mention, it looks and feels just as premium as it sounds.</p><p>And if you're an environmentalist or an avid adventurer with a penchant for nature, the Razr Ultra 2025 is also available in a gorgeous wooden option called Mountain Trail. It's literally a phone made with polished wooden bits incorporated into its core. What a lovely concept!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-15" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 AI key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We get fun phones on and off, particularly futuristic-looking designs like Nothing's transparent shtick or that heavy gamer aesthetic that brands like ASUS and Red Magic favor. But beyond that, flagship brands like Apple, Samsung, and Google have all moved towards bland blocks of glass and metal with as little character and individuality as possible. I'm sick of it.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">Pixel 9a losing its signature camera</a> bar was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I'm tired of Samsung regurgitating the same tired designs year after year. This is not a trend; it's the death of creativity. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> did nothing to differentiate itself from its predecessor, visually speaking, and I've got a funny feeling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will be just as disappointingly predictable.</p>

<p>Frankly, it's refreshing to see a mainstream phone brand like Motorola doing things differently. I'm so glad they didn't commit such a crime against the Razr family.</p><p>From a business perspective, it's a really smart move too. Product differentiation is crucial when going up against well-established brands in the market. Motorola is slowly but surely building its own base of loyal customers whom the brand will certainly retain if it continues down this path.</p><p>If Samsung doesn't add uniquely distinguishable features to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, Motorola will surely win the battle for the clamshell foldable pie of the smartphone market.</p>

Doing so will undoubtedly be time-consuming, and we'll need to wait and see if the factories assembling iPhones in India can handle the increased demand.</p>

<p>Apple in general is enjoying a heady momentum in India, gaining sizeable market share on the back of strong sales. But what I like the most is the attention the brand is paying to Indian consumers on the software front; iOS 18.4 debuted a month ago, and while it doesn't bring much in the way of bold new features, it adds Indic language integration to the OS, and it is wonderful.</p><p>In typical Apple fashion, the brand took a while to add localization to iOS, but having used the feature over the last month, I can say with some confidence that it is a much better implementation than Android. I switched the system language to Telugu on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> and Hindi on another device, and both languages have tight integration; it's great to see the attention to detail Apple lavished towards its localization efforts.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mVyGfaT28hih9yH5dEhofa" name="iphone-indic-language-2" alt="iPhone 16 Pro Max running Telugu and Hindi languages within iOS 18.4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mVyGfaT28hih9yH5dEhofa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are still a few labels that show up in English — like Apple Intelligence — but everywhere else, you'll see Indic languages as standard. What's interesting about this is that all the sub-menus and details in utilities like Fitness and Health are also translated into Indic languages, and that makes it easier to understand key metrics like calories burned and activity data.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uHNyTrrMGG7bA9QKyvaWda" name="iphone-indic-language-3" alt="iPhone 16 Pro Max running Telugu and Hindi languages within iOS 18.4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uHNyTrrMGG7bA9QKyvaWda.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple stuck to a standard notation in settings where it transliterated text into Telugu without changing the English naming — it's just that the alphabet has changed. Google does things a little differently where it translates the word into the source language, and it's not as easy to locate menus and sub-menus within settings because of that (at least for me).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7mxm6AdJx7UvWWwL4W3qha" name="iphone-indic-language-6" alt="iPhone 16 Pro Max running Telugu and Hindi languages within iOS 18.4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7mxm6AdJx7UvWWwL4W3qha.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If anything, the only limitation I can think of is that Apple Intelligence isn't available with most Indic languages, so you miss out on most of the AI-assisted features. Other than that, Apple did a thorough job integrating most Indic languages into iOS, and it's refreshing to use the iPhone in my native language.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DeNUh5ddzqpwHR6ETD6Nia" name="iphone-indic-language-4" alt="iPhone 16 Pro Max running Telugu and Hindi languages within iOS 18.4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DeNUh5ddzqpwHR6ETD6Nia.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While English literacy is high in India, the ability to use regional languages with an iPhone makes it that much more enticing. This should lead to a meaningful increase in sales, and I know one loyal Android user who's willing to switch to iOS as a result of this change. My dad has been using Android phones for the last decade — he's currently on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a> — and while he likes using the device, he's run into several issues with Bluetooth connectivity and pairing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">OnePlus Watch 2</a>.</p><p>I suggested he switch over to an iPhone several times in the past, but he's found iOS to be restrictive. But with the switch to Indic languages, he's interested in trying out the platform; he likes to type in Telugu and uses Gboard extensively, and the tight integration of local languages combined with the fact that Gboard is just as good on iOS as it is on Android was enough to get him at least intrigued about switching over.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="wUGjxDrGdcKkbEg7nvdVga" name="iphone-indic-language-5" alt="iPhone 16 Pro Max running Telugu and Hindi languages within iOS 18.4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wUGjxDrGdcKkbEg7nvdVga.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another plus point is the broader ecosystem. My dad is very active, and he likes using smartwatches; he's wanted something like the Apple Watch but on Android, and there just isn't something that has a similar design and feature-set. Now that he's moving to an iPhone (I'm giving him an iPhone 16), I'm setting him up with an Apple Watch, and I'm excited to see how he likes the platform.</p><p>On the whole, iOS 18.4 is a definite step in the right direction, and combined with the increased attention to the country and positioning its products aggressively, it's obvious that Apple is gaining considerable momentum.</p>

I plan to stick with my Lite subscription for the long haul. And only one thing would make it better: if Google worked Lite into its group and annual membership plans.</p><p>YouTube is apparently testing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-launches-new-two-person-premium-subscription-tier-for-select-countries">couples' Premium membership</a> in India, France, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, a nice two-person middle ground for people who can't take full advantage of the Family subscription for five people.</p><p>It could take months or years for this promotion to reach the U.S., if it comes here at all. But even if it does, Google has thus far only offered group rates for the full-price Premium plan with YouTube Music and all the bells and whistles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UghHxcSsxqYZ8eNYBdqQc" name="YT- Premium-subscription-for -two" alt="YT Premium subscription for two people pilots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UghHxcSsxqYZ8eNYBdqQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The new "Two-person" YouTube Premium, available in India </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Money Control)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My fiancée and I both stream way too much YouTube every day, from her Critical Role and cat videos to my Let's Plays. But no one else in our respective families cares all that much about YouTube, so a $23/month family Premium plan felt like overkill.</p><p>But a YouTube Premium Lite two-person plan? That we could easily fit into our budget! So I can only hope Google decides to offer a wider range of unconventional family plans soon.</p>

<p>I don't have official stats on YouTube ad frequency, but ever since I let my Premium subscription lapse after the 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-raising-price-of-youtube-premium">price hike</a>, it has sure <em>felt</em> like Google has piled in more ads per video in the past year than I ever remember seeing.</p><p>I still tense up when I click a thumbnail, my brain trained to expect 5–15 seconds of garbage as I wait frantically for the Skip ad pop-up. Skip ahead a minute? That's usually an ad. Pause the video for five minutes to check on my screaming cat? Time to auto-reload the page with a fresh ad!</p><p>That's why Premium Lite has been such a simple joy, easily worth the $8/month.</p><p>I let my original Premium subscription lapse because I couldn't justify $14/month to remove ads when I already had another preferred music app. It didn't matter how good YouTube Music was; I just wanted the <em>choice</em> to bundle it in or not.</p><p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-made-a-mistake-with-youtube-premium">made this argument</a>, I usually got one of two responses: I was an idiot for not switching to YT Music — even my managing editor bullies me about this — or I was a moron for not using Brave, Pie, NewPipe, or other workarounds to avoid ads for free.</p>

<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-will-finally-uncouple-youtube-premium-and-youtube-music-with-premium-lite">making Premium Lite available</a> felt like validation; clearly, I wasn't alone in wanting this option, and I was right to cancel my sub until Google let me pay for what I needed <em>and nothing else</em>. The only thing I really miss is having background play — and I can live without it — and downloadable videos.</p><p>As for ad blockers or ad-free browsers, yes, I'm aware that they exist. But I disabled my AdBlock years before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-three-strikes-policy-for-ad-blockers">YouTube started punishing people for using these methods</a>.</p><p>I didn't think much about it during my college days, but once I had a full-time job, I felt pretty conflicted about using a loophole that stopped the YouTubers I liked from getting paid for their work. Plus, my favorite creators apparently earn much more from my Premium views than from ad revenue, so it feels good to support my favorite channels more directly.</p>

<p>Now I'm just hoping that Google eventually offers a Premium Lite annual subscription, maybe for $79.99/year instead of $95.88 total with a monthly sub. After that, Google should move on to two-person and family Premium Lite plans.</p><p>Google bundled Premium and YouTube Music to get families hooked on both, but it means families already invested in Spotify Premium Family or Apple One Family won't give Google money because it means double-dipping.</p><p>A Premium Lite family or couple plan would be more tempting as a standalone, and once Google hooks a family, it's much harder to unsubscribe because all your freeloading family members will complain. So it should benefit their bottom line, too.</p><p>Make these new Premium Lite plans happen, Google! In the meantime, I'll keep happily paying for myself.</p>

<ul><li>The May 2025 update is rolling out for Google Pixel devices with fixes for another zero-day exploit.</li><li>It may take about a week for the update to reach all Pixel phones and tablets, depending on your device and carrier, and you should update immediately.</li><li>The patch also includes three minor bug fixes for Google Pixel 6 and newer phones and tablets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The May 2025 security update is rolling out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel</a> devices as of today, May 6, and it includes a critical patch for a zero-day security vulnerability. The update also includes three bug fixes and 28 total security patches for issues affecting Android and Google services. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/342521516/google-pixel-update-may-2025?hl=en&sjid=665115666812218645-NC" target="_blank">says</a> that the May 2025 update's rollout will continue over the next week, depending on your carrier and device model, so you might not see it immediately.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-05-01" target="_blank">Android Security Bulletin</a> outlines the security issues addressed with this month's Pixel update, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-users-just-dodged-a-bullet-as-the-cve-cybersecurity-tracker-stays-funded">the zero-day exploit tracked as CVE-2025-27363</a>. The bulletin notes that "there are indications that CVE-2025-27363 may be under limited, targeted exploitation." Essentially, this means you should update your device as soon as the May 2025 patch is available to avoid falling victim to this security exploit.</p><p>The May 2025 security patch will also update your device's bootloader to add anti-rollback measures. After updating, you won't be able to run older versions of Android 15 on your device. This is likely in response to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-april-security-update-screen-flicker-camera-fixes">both the April and May patches including fixes</a> for zero-day exploits.</p><p>"The May 2025 update for Pixel 6 (6, 6 Pro, 6a) and Pixel 8 (8, 8 Pro, 8a) devices contains a bootloader update that increments the anti-rollback version for the bootloader," Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/android/images" target="_blank">explains</a>. "This prevents the device from rolling back to previous vulnerable versions of the bootloader. After flashing the May 2025 update on these devices you won't be able to flash and boot older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> builds."</p>

<p>The May 2025 update also addresses three bugs affecting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-experience-with-google-pixel-6-two-years-later">Google Pixel 6</a> and newer phones and tablets, as Google explains in the release notes below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Audio</strong><ul><li>Fix for degraded microphone recording quality in certain apps</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bluetooth</strong><ul><li>Fix for Bluetooth pairing issues with certain smartwatches under certain conditions</li></ul></li><li><strong>Framework</strong><ul><li>Fix for secondary language displayed in quick settings under certain conditions</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>When the update becomes available, all Google Pixel users should install it immediately. You can check for updates by opening the <strong>Settings app</strong> and navigating to <strong>System</strong> > <strong>Software update</strong> > <strong>System update</strong> and pressing <strong>Check for update</strong>. Then, follow the on-screen prompts to download and install the OTA update once available.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>-backed feature for iOS users on its Google App. The tech giant announced this feature, dubbed "Simplify", in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/simplify-google-app-ios/">Keyword</a> earlier today (May 6).</p><p>As the name suggests, this feature breaks down complex concepts into easily understandable text. This is particularly useful when users are trying to learn about something new on the web; they might come across content that uses jargon or technical concepts they're not familiar with.</p><p>Google added that Simplify "uses AI to make dense text on the web easier to understand — without leaving a web page." Thus, people can understand long, winding words seamlessly without losing their research/reading flow.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kaemmp72eLHxctPw2HGzHQ" name="Google-Simplify - iOS" alt="Google's experiment to test Simplify feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kaemmp72eLHxctPw2HGzHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to the tech giant, the goal here is to simplify text while making sure that the meaning of the original text isn't lost along the way. Google refers to this as "minimally lossy" simplification.</p><p>Before rolling out this feature on a large scale, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.google/blog/making-complex-text-understandable-minimally-lossy-text-simplification-with-gemini/">Google Research tested this</a> on a large cohort of nearly 4.500 participants, who were handpicked for topic expertise.</p><p>"We used 31 diverse, real-world text excerpts across domains known for complexity: medical research, biology, law, finance, literature, philosophy, aerospace, and computer science," Google stated.</p><p>These participants were given either the original text, the simplified version, or both. Following this, these users were tested on their ability to retain the text. And were judged based on two conditions: one where they could refer back to the text while answering questions, and one where they could not.</p><p>This resulted in people who read the simplified text understanding the information significantly better and retaining it more compared to reading the original complex text.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oFqaEsnwXb3i9ku6HNdcLo" name="Google-Simplify - iOS" alt="Google Search rolls out "Simplify" on iOS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oFqaEsnwXb3i9ku6HNdcLo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To use Simplify, select any complex text on a web page you’re visiting in the Google app. Tap the <strong>“Simplify” </strong>icon that appears, and a new window with a simpler version of the text will pop up.</p><p>iOS users with the latest version of the Google App might spot this new feature in action starting today. While it remains unclear when this could roll out to Android users, Android Central has reached out to the tech giant and will update this article when we have more information.</p>

<h2 id="there-s-more-than-enough-great-motorola-razr-2025-cases-available-2">There's more than enough great Motorola Razr 2025 cases available</h2>
<p>The best Motorola Razr 2025 cases come in various shapes, colors, and styles. You can go for a simple clear case or choose something flashy. The Razr 2025 is pretty robust on its own though, and it's one of the few phones I would use naked. Any case adds some level of drop protection, but generally the thicker the case the better the impact absorption, so it's never a bad idea to get one.</p><p>Since you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-2024-cases">Razr 2024 cases</a> on the Razr 2025, you might want to hang on to its covers if you're upgrading devices. When buying new, however, the search might feel a little overwhelming. That's why I've curated this guide of the best cases you should get for your Razr 2025, depending on your needs.</p><p>The best overall pick is the Fin2feel Magnetic Motorola Razr 2024/2025 Case because it's affordably priced, adds 10ft drop protection, promises not to yellow over time, and has a magnetic ring on the back so you can use MagSafe and Qi2 accessories. A clear case like this also lets you admire the color of your Razr 2025 while keeping it fresh. For such a decent case, $14 is a pretty sweet price to pay.</p><p>Another highly functional option is the CCSmall Crossbody Wallet Case. This might be too bulky for some, and that $25 asking price isn't exactly cheap, but the colorways are unique, the crossbody strap is super useful, and the wallet slots are really generous. You could even prop up your Motorola Razr 2025 while watching something thanks to the wallet compartment.</p>

That is, until the Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller arrived at my doorstep a few weeks ago.</p><p>While it certainly resembles my favorite GameSir controller, it has a special superpower that no other controller to date has: the ability to plug a pair of smart glasses in while getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">the neck-saving comfort</a> of smart glasses. More specifically, a pair of Viture Pro smart glasses plugs into the new 8BitDo Ultimate controller, putting the screen on your face so your arms can relax.</p><p>We've named Viture the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> ecosystem because the company has so many different gadgets that work with its glasses, while most other smart glasses are just designed to plug into a smartphone or laptop. This new controller solves a very real problem in the mobile gaming sector, and it does it without eliminating the ability to charge the phone <em>and</em> <em>still</em> play on your glasses.</p>

<p>The Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller gets all the basics right. It's got dual Hall Effect joysticks, a <em>proper</em> d-pad (read: not one of those circular garbage ones), four face buttons, a screenshot and home button on the front, start and select buttons, two bumpers, two back buttons, and two analog-style triggers.</p><p>The contours are incredibly comfortable, and the controller itself is a smidge smaller than the GameSir G8 Galileo, which makes it feel less cumbersome than that controller. Don't get me wrong, I love the Galileo, but it can feel a little on the chunky side if you have smaller hands.</p><p>The controller connects to your phone via a USB-C port on the right, which is great for most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best smartphones</a>, but large book-style foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> should remain closed unless you like a big phone hanging down below your controller.</p>

<p>All of the buttons are customizable via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bbitdo.advanceandroidv2&hl=en">8BitDo Ultimate Software V2 app</a>; just make sure you're using the <strong>V2</strong> app and not the original release.

Viture tells me it's working on a "Full-FoV" feature that lets you launch full-screen games through the app, similar to how the experience feels when connecting Viture smart glasses to a Samsung phone that supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>.</p><p>Of course, the real draw here isn't just the controller comfort or the customizable buttons — all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">best mobile controllers</a> do those already — instead, it's the ability to connect to your Viture Pro smart glasses while enjoying the ultra-low-latency that only a USB-C gaming controller can deliver.</p>

<p>Since neither the glasses nor the controller has an internal battery, they're both powered by your phone's battery. I've been mostly using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> to test this pair, but I haven't seen any obvious battery drain issues on it or on some other phones I've tested, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>. If the phone does happen to need a top-up, you can plug a USB-C cable or any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best power banks</a> into that top USB-C port, and the cord won't even get in the way since it's up top. Brilliant!</p><p>The bulk of my play sessions were spent in Monster Hunter Wilds via GeForce Now on my phone, and my gosh, did it ever look good in 1440p at 120FPS on those Viture Pro smart glasses. It doesn't even require setup or anything like that, either. Just plug the glasses into that dedicated port on the controller, and you're good to go.</p><p>If you'd rather skip the smart glasses and just use it handheld from time to time, there's no need to change any settings or do anything extra. Just plug your phone into the controller and play away. If you <em>do</em> end up deciding the glasses are the right idea, though, make sure you get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4/">Viture Pro</a> and not another pair, as the Pro model is the only one that works with the controllers.</p>

<p>Motorola has raised the bar for what a premium flip phone should look like with the new Razr Ultra 2025. The $1,299 price tag officially makes it the most expensive Motorola flip phone yet, and has its eyes set squarely on the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>.</p><p>The reason for introducing this third option in the Razr line was to try to capture the premium end of the market, according to Motorola. This calls for a Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs. Razr Ultra 2025 comparison since it's a choice most users in the U.S. are going to have to make once the former is formerly introduced.</p><p>We don't know exactly what the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will be like, but we've got enough leaks for a rough sketch. We might finally get a larger outer display, a slightly bigger battery, some tweaks to the design and hinge, and new software. All of this is speculative right now, but one thing's for sure: Samsung better wow us with its upcoming foldable if it hopes to take down Motorola's dominance and claim the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone" target="_blank">best foldable</a> title.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-05" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> is expected to start at the same price as the Z Flip 6: $1,099.99 for 256GB of storage and $1,219.99 for 512GB. Both variants come with 12GB of RAM. This would make the Flip 7 fairly expensive, just like its predecessor. Hopefully, the flurry of expected upgrades should help justify the price. One area where Samsung leads is in the length of software upgrades.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> only comes in a single variant with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, for $1,299. It's only a little more than Samsung's equivalent storage variant, but you get a lot more RAM. Additionally, buying the phone directly from Motorola will score you 1TB of storage, more than Samsung has ever featured on a flip phone.</p><p>Preorders for the Razr begin on May 7, and the phone goes on sale on May 15. Apart from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-software-update-support">long-term software support</a>, the Razr Ultra 2025 has equally good or better specs than the expected Z Flip 7, making it look like a much better value.</p>

<p>The big upgrade we're all curious to see is if Samsung actually goes with a larger, edge-to-edge cover display on the Galaxy Z Flip 7. The recent leaks and renders all point towards it, and it should be true in all likelihood.</p><p>We hope Samsung unlocks the ability to natively <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">run standard apps on the cover screen</a> too, and not just widgets, which should be a great utility upgrade. The phone is also expected to have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-finally-give-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-the-screen-upgrades-they-need">slightly larger 6.8-inch folding display</a>, which could make it slightly wider or taller, depending on the new aspect ratio. It will lilely feature a FHD+ resolution and 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>If the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is anything like the render above, we're looking at a more boxier design compared to even the past generation. We fear that the Flip 7 could be less comfortable to hold than the Flip 6, but we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KuyQUn9CEfDpMLw4EWxpCe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-18" alt="Different colors of the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KuyQUn9CEfDpMLw4EWxpCe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025's design and displays are in another league altogether, which is interesting when you consider how poorly Motorola lagged behind Samsung when both had just introduced their first-gen flip phones. Motorola's obsession with adding different textures to the bottom half of the phone continues as the Razr Ultra gets two unique finishes, including one with wood and another with Alcantara.</p><p>The Ultra's display specs are epic. Both screens on the Razr Ultra 2025 have a 165Hz refresh rate and are bright pOLED panels. The Super HD+ resolution of the internal display is also quite high, finding a medium between FHD+ panels on many flagships and QHD displays on premium models. The outer glass gets Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic, which should help it survive scratches and cracks well.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TWRFBH69hmoT5yMMNVDz25" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-26" alt="Perplexity on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TWRFBH69hmoT5yMMNVDz25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're not expecting a big change when it comes to cameras on the Galaxy Z Flip 7. The cameras on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> were fine and did a decent job, and that'll probably apply to the Z Flip 7 too.</p><p>We should expect a main 50MP sensor with optical stabilization and a 12MP ultrawide camera on the outside. All the leaks so far point to it being a dual-camera setup once again, so it's unlikely that we'll have a third telephoto. The camera in the folding display will probably be the same 10MP sensor again. Real-world image quality should be better, especially if the phone gets the Snapdragon 8 Elite's new ISP and improved software tuning in One UI.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="f2PjhiTXGxJuKTS74nZa8f" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-mint-01.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 cameras and cover panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f2PjhiTXGxJuKTS74nZa8f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 now comes with Pantone Validated cameras, which Motorola says should deliver better skin tones and color reproduction. The Razr Ultra also has a 50MP main camera with a similar apeture and specs. There's also a 50MP ultrawide, which in all likelihood, should be able to capture greater level of details than the Z Flip 7. Motorola uses a 50MP sensor for the selfie camera too, which again, should produce much better photos than Samsung.</p><p>Both phones might offer similar performance in daylight shots, but Motorola should have the edge in low-light and ultrawide photos. It can also shoot at 8K, while the Z Flip 7 could be limited to 4K, but we don't know for sure until the phone launches.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="45qixYcw9UkSSQ7FVBCmLV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-leaked-render-3" alt="Leaked image of a blue Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/45qixYcw9UkSSQ7FVBCmLV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the performance front, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 could potentially be on equal footing, assuming they both have the Snapdragon 8 Elite. This hasn't been confirmed yet for the Galaxy but we're almost certain it would use that chip, although come rumors have indicated it may <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-might-not-use-a-snapdragon-chip-after-all">use the Exynos 2500</a> instead.</p><p>Benchmark numbers would be up and down for both phones, with some favoring the Razr and vice versa. I don't think you'll notice any difference in real-world usage, though. Games and apps should perform similarly on both. The Razr Ultra could have an advantage for AI tasks and long-term usage thanks to the higher RAM.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-One-UI-7-welcome" alt="One UI 7 welcome screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, sitting in front of colorful plants" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Software will also play a big role in how these phones perform, and here, Samsung has Motorola beat when it comes to updates. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 will most likely get seven years of OS and security updates, just like the current flagship S series. That's a big commitment and will ensure your phone is still relevant even if you decide to sell it a few years later.</p><p>Samsung had a few hiccups with the rollout of One UI 7, but it has generally been timely with new software updates. We should also see some new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features being introduced with the Flip 7.</p><p>The Razr Ultra will only get three OS upgrades, which is not great when you're paying above $1,000. Plus, Motorola doesn't have the best track record for issuing timely updates either, which means it's a bit of a leap of faith here. Motorola is doubling down on AI this year to better compete with Samsung.</p><p>The Razr Ultra 2025 has a dedicated button to activate the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> hub, which is genuinely useful and does not feel like an afterthought. One of the unique new features is Look and Talk, which lets the phone's owner simply look at the phone in tented mode and start conversing with the AI. We'll be testing all the AI features in our full review, so don't forget to check that when it drops.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-could-get-a-slightly-wider-display-a-new-leak-suggests">slightly larger battery</a> than last time, at 4,300mAh. This should provide a little boost and help the phone last a little longer. Plus, the new chip and software optimizations could help deliver double-digit battery gains compared to the Z Flip 6.</p><p>Charging specs are expected to be the same too, at 25W, although there is a good chance we could see 45W as Samsung has begun using this for its budget A-series phones too. Wireless charging should be present as well at 15W.</p><p>The Razr Ultra 2025 has a much larger 4,700mAh battery, which should deliver vastly better battery life than the Z Flip 7 on paper, although they both could end up being similar. We're yet to test the Razr, but that battery also needs to power two incredibly bright and high-resolution displays, which could negate the advantage of having the higher capacity. We'll know for sure once we have tested both phones, but don't be surprised if both end up having similar battery life in real-world usage.</p>

<p>I know it's easier to recommend the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 for its potential for wider availability and longer software support, but the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 just feels like the better product, as of now anyway.</p><p>The Z Flip 7 is not yet official, so our opinion could change based on what it ends up offering, but the Razr Ultra is a better value pick right now. It's expensive, sure, but you get some of the best specs not found anywhere on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> in the U.S., along with excellent carrier support. If you're not too bothered with keeping the phone for very long, then the Razr Ultra 2025 looks like a winner through and through.</p>

<h2 id="there-s-only-three-ways-you-can-go-when-choosing-a-motorola-razr-plus-2025-color-2">There's only three ways you can go when choosing a Motorola Razr Plus 2025 color</h2>
<p>To make it simple, you only have three options when Motorola Razr Plus 2025. It comes in pink, brown, and blue. Depth, tone, and texture bring a lot of much-needed context to the three color variants. Of course, getting a good look at all the options is your primary step. That's why this guide focuses on explaining the finish in detail before helping you pick on shade to buy.</p><p>Now that you've seen the shades, you know that all three Razr Plus 2025 finishes are either leather or similar to satin. If you don't or do prefer a certain texture, that's already enough for you to narrow down the colorways. For example, only Hot Pink comes with a satin finish, so you can either prioritize that or cut it out of your shortlist.</p><p>The two vegan leather options also differ slightly, as the Midnight Blue option is an imitation of basic leather. Meanwhile, Mocha Mousse is a lot more complex as it is speckled with little dark spots just like grains of coffee in an actual cup of mocha.</p><p>Based on how much of a grainy texture you like, Mocha Mousse may or may not be the perfect fit for you. It all depends on your preferences and style. Personally, I find that this tan coffee-colored foldable is the most stunning variant of the Motorola Razr Plus 2025. That's a tough call even for someone like me because I adore pink and I love the legacy of that shade on the Razr.</p><p>Even so, Mocha Mousse plays with texture and brings something new to the table. The little details like the dark specks are such an underrated touch. It's definitely the Razr Plus 2025 colorway that stands out the most. So if you're still confused after all this advice, go for it.</p><p>And if you're not even sure about which exact model of the Razr 2025 series you're looking to purchase, we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">a handy guide for that</a> too.</p>

<ul><li>Android 16 is about to bring a robust Battery Health page to Pixel phones with key performance data.</li><li>The page will show estimated battery capacity as a real-time percentage compared to a new battery.</li><li>Notably, Google is confirming that only the Pixel 8a and newer will receive the useful features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is adding a Battery Health statistics page to the Settings app for Pixel phones with Android 16, but most models won't be supported. The company says that the feature will be available "on Pixel 8a and Pixel 9 products including 9 Pro Fold" in a reply to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/403373209?pli=1#comment6" target="_blank">Issue Tracker</a> ticket concerning Battery Health availability. That leaves out all Pixel models released before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>, including the rest of the Pixel 8 series and the original Pixel Fold.</p><p>"The Battery Health Indicator feature is currently supported in Beta 3 on Pixel 8a and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> products including 9 Pro Fold," a Google employee wrote on May 1. "Due to product limitations, this feature will not be available on older in-market Pixel devices."</p><p>Newer Google Pixel devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-check-android-phone-battery-health">already showed cycle count data</a> as of last year, but the Battery Health page is set to bring more detailed analytics. Specifically, battery capacity will be shown as a percentage compared to its new state. This should give users an easy-to-understand idea of how their battery will perform on a daily basis, even years after their phone purchase.</p>

<p>"This [battery capacity] is an estimated percentage of charge the battery can currently hold compared to a new standard battery," the Battery Health page in the Android 16 beta explains. "Battery capacity decreases over time."</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-phones-might-finally-introduce-battery-health-feature-with-android-16">Battery Health page</a> shows a green checkmark and a <strong>Normal</strong> status if the battery is working as expected. It also offers quick links to battery-related support articles, and lists any charging optimization features that are enabled — such as Adaptive Charging.</p><p>While it's unclear what "product limitations" prevent Pixel phones older than the Pixel 8a from supporting the Battery Health page, it may have something to do with the batteries themselves.</p><p>Starting with the Pixel 8a, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15738128?hl=en" target="_blank">Google says</a> Pixel phones can reach 1,000 charge cycles before needing a battery replacement. Older Pixel phones, namely the Pixel 3 through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> and Pixel Fold, are only rated for up to 800 charge cycles before a battery replacement is recommended.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, and the Battery Health feature for Pixels, will likely be shown off at Google I/O 2025.

<p>Motorola went all out with the Razr 2025 launch. The colorways themselves are exceptional. Sure, we've seen brands like OnePlus and Xiaomi play around with textures before. But Motorola left no holes barred, giving us four unique textures and color options across the board for every Razr 2025 model.</p><p>With all those options, it's only natural that this decision isn't easy. And that's after you've decided on which model you want to buy.</p><p>I'm here to simplify this process for you. Each one of the Motorola Razr 2025 colorways are epic, so regardless of what you choose don't doubt yourself. However, if you simply can't break the tie between a few shades, I'd say go for the uniquely textured Lightest Sky variant.</p><p>That stunning marble-like back is so opulent and grand, you'll start sticking your pinky out whilst sipping on tea. It's the best take on the beige/cream colorway that Samsung, Google, Apple, and many other name brands have dabbled in before. All of them pale in comparison to Motorola's way of doing things.</p>

<p>Let's go a little more in-depth about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr 2025</a> and its last-gen counterpart, the Razr 2024. Both devices have the exact same measurements, and they even weigh the same. With the Plus models, it's the same thing. Both the Razr Plus 2025 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> have matching dimensions.</p><p>It's not always true that these factors determine whether you can use the same case on both phones though. After all, Samsung is notorious for changing camera lens positions or button placement just enough that you can't use an older case on a newer phone model. However, Motorola didn't go down that path and we are thankful for it.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-vs-razr-2024">Motorola Razr 2025 and the Motorola Razr 2024</a> are mirror images of each other, as are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-vs-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2025 and Razr Plus 2024</a>, except for the color options (and of course the internals are completely different, but that doesn't matter here). Everything from the button placement to the location of the cameras is identical. This is what makes it possible for you to use a Razr 2024 case on the newer Razr 2025.</p><p>In fact, most smartphone case manufacturers that cater to Motorola didn't even bother to release new cases made specifically for the Motorola Razr 2025 or Razr Plus 2025. As far as I've seen, a good 80% to 90% of them have just renamed their pre-existing product listings for Razr Plus 2024 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-motorola-razr-2024-cases">Razr 2024 cases</a> to include the Razr Plus 2025 or the Razr 2025.</p><p>This isn't a bad thing. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Manufacturers don't need to make a new mould to make new cases for the latest Razr model, so the price stays the same. And since the Razr 2024 lineup is already old now, those cases are cheaper than they were at the Razr 2024 launch.</p><p>This means all Razr 2025 and Razr 2025 Plus owners have access to a cheaper and much more diverse and wider assortment of cases than they would if they had bought another newly launched phone, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>. The cherry on top is that it's good for the environment too, since you can reuse your old case should you choose to upgrade. Everybody wins.</p>

<p>As it turned out, Motorola introduced a third new model with the Razr 2025 series. The Razr Ultra 2025 is a new entrant to the Razr family, so there's no last-gen version of it.</p><p>In case you're wondering whether you can use the Razr Plus 2024 or 2025 case on the Razr Ultra 2025, let me stop you right there. The dimensions are slightly off, so none of the Razr Plus covers will fit it.</p><p>Apart from the difference in measurements, the Razr Ultra 2025 also deviated from the Razr and Razr Plus models of 2024 and 2025 in button placement. The volume buttons of the Razr Ultra 2025 are situated on the right side of the phone instead of the left. So even if you wanted to use a soft malleable case for the Razr Plus 2025 or 2024 on the Razr Ultra 2025, it could never work.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re a Samsung user looking for a great deal on wireless earbuds; you value great sound and noise cancellation in your audio equipment.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t regularly use Samsung devices; you&apos;re looking to spend $100 or less on earbuds. </p><p>As we described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">our Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review</a>, these wireless earbuds are pretty much perfect for any user already immersed in the Galaxy ecosystem. Pairing the buds with a newer Galaxy phone like Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Z Flip 6</a> will let you experience Samsung&apos;s proprietary SSC (Samsung Scalable Codec) technology in action. This means you&apos;re getting better dynamic range, clearer audio, and less noise when you use the Buds 3 Pro. These premium earbuds also deliver 24-bit hi-res support with spatial audio, up to 30 hours of battery life, and active noise cancellation (ANC) straight out of the box. </p><p>Of course, if you aren&apos;t a Galaxy user and you just want a great pair of earbuds, something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">Sony WF-1000XM5</a> may be a better, albeit more expensive, choice. Furthermore, Google Pixel users may be better off skipping these Samsung earbuds altogether and buying something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>. Needless to say, there are plenty of excellent wireless earbuds to choose from nowadays, but if you&apos;re already a Samsung user, this might just be the best earbuds deal on the web today.</p>

<hr>
<p>One UI 8 rumors press on, and a new set claims Samsung is working on upgrading the security/privacy of a key Knox security feature.</p><p>Tipster IposDev has allegedly been sifting through an early Samsung One UI 8 build, claiming the OS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DevOfIpos/status/1919344240036872260">will upgrade Secure Folder</a> with Google software (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-8-to-make-samsungs-secure-folder-even-more-secure/">SamMobile</a>). Supposedly, the early test build offers insight into the API swap of Secure Folder from Samsung's old work profile preference to Google's Private Spaces.</p><p>In the comments, the tipster responded to a user, stating, "There are some private space APIs on the system side." The tipster went further, adding that they went through the profile IDs, which apparently doubles down on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-secure-folders-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">Secure Folder's</a> swap to Private Spaces.</p><p>The provided snapshots don't highlight any sort of forward-facing change for users. Secure Folder's description reads mostly the same, highlighting its ability to provide "an extra layer of protection" for items you want to keep secure and private on your device, like apps, photos, and more.</p>

<p>This change could be beneficial for users as Secure Folder previously leveraged Android's Work Profiles to separate your data — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-most-secure-feature-seems-to-have-a-few-holes">and that backfired</a>. A vulnerability in One UI 7 was discovered earlier this year, which exposed users' media files in Secure Folder (images, videos) to other apps, which wasn't supposed to happen. This problem was reportedly restricted to people who had <em>physical </em>access to your device.</p><p>Work profiles set up by third-party apps for Secure Folder were also at risk during the initial discovery. Samsung acknowledged the extreme security flaw in February 2025, but didn't offer a potential solution. However, with what's presently rumored for One UI 8, perhaps this is the fix we're looking for.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-android-upcoming-security-privacy-layers">Private Spaces</a> was announced by Google during its 2024 I/O event as a tool to help users safeguard their important, sensitive data. The feature, when enabled, would create a new area on a user's Pixel to store sensitive apps and data. Private Spaces requires users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-create-private-space-for-your-apps-on-pixel">create a whole new PIN</a> (or fingerprint) for maximum safety.</p><p>It's been a day for One UI 8 rumors, as a recent report stems from a user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/someone-with-a-galaxy-s25-ended-up-getting-an-alleged-one-ui-8-update">who allegedly got One UI 8 working</a> on a Galaxy S25. The user showed off Samsung's changes to the weather app, like 3D images and animations, as well as the phone call update to the Now Bar. More news on One UI 8 might await us at Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">summer Unpacked</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables and more, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<hr>
<p>Google's experimental versions of Gemini 2.5 Pro are getting a boost, as there's a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/" target="_blank">Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview</a> (I/O edition) model available for tasks that involve coding and advanced reasoning. The early access comes ahead of Google I/O 2025, an annual developer conference later this month, the company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-2-5-pro-updates/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The full update will be released at the event, but the preview is already a top performer on key AI benchmarks.</p><p>Users will find "meaningful improvements for front-end and UI development, alongside improvements in fundamental coding tasks such as transforming and editing code, and creating sophisticated agentic workflows," the company explained in a separate post on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-2-5-pro-io-improved-coding-performance/" target="_blank">Google for Developers blog</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview</a> ranks first on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.lmarena.ai/leaderboard" target="_blank">WebDev Arena leaderboard</a> at the time of publishing, a benchmark that specifically tests AI models' performance in web development exercises. It tops <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet" target="_blank">Claude 3.7 Sonnet</a>, which now holds second place. Google holds two of the top three WebDev Arena leaderboard spots, with Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental still holding third place.</p>

<ul><li>Google's Pixel 9 Pro is poking fun at Apple over a recent string of iPhone 17 rumors.</li><li>The rumors suggest the device could adopt a horizonal camera bar, which looks a lot like the latest Pixel lineup.</li><li>Google's design director stated last summer that the Pixel 9's large camera bump is a product of consumer interests, as people want to take good, high-quality photos.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's #BestPhonesForever series is back, and this time, the company is teasing Apple over a rumor.</p><p>Google posted a new entry to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/A26C66LX2AA">series on YouTube</a>, saying the show's host, Pixel, is "Responding to the Rumors" with its best buddy, the iPhone. The two devices are discussing the recent string of rumors regarding Apple's potential design for the iPhone 17. As talks begin, the iPhone says, "It's crazy, can you imagine me doing the same thing you did first years later?" The Pixel quips back, "Sounds pretty far-fetched."</p><p>One look at this rumored design can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1igpd3m/iphone_17_air_features_google_pixel_look/">be seen on Reddit</a>, where users discussed the purported new Pixel-like look. The rumored render shows Apple's iPhone with a horizontal camera bar situation, which gives us serious Pixel 9 series vibes.</p><p>On the other hand, our friends at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/google-pokes-fun-at-apple-for-the-iphone-17s-rumored-pixel-style-redesign">TechRadar</a> highlighted a set of alleged CAD renderings, which continue the horizontal bar narrative. Image runs through a few variations, even a small vertical island, but the Pixel-esque design is still apparent. However, as the publication notes, the rumors suggest the bar will be slightly higher on the device and could expand even more for Apple's iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max if it's to be believed.</p>
<h2 id="google-s-unapologetic-camera-bar-2">Google's Unapologetic Camera Bar</h2>

<p>Regardless, these are nothing but rumors, as the Pixel and iPhone state in their podcast. Google didn't end there with the rumors, as the iPhone walked through other ways Apple "copied" the Pixel. The video highlights Google's Night Sight and Apple's Night Mode "a year later." There's also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a> and Clean Up comparison, too.</p><p>Google's Pixel 9 series camera bar is (unapologetically) huge, but the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">design director says there's a reason why</a>. Last August, Claude Zellweger, Google's Director of Design for Pixel phones, held an interview where they discussed <em>why </em>the camera bump is the way it is. The main takeaway was that the Pixel 9's camera bar was the product of consumer interests. Zellweger stated Google understands that consumers want the ability to take good, high-quality pictures.</p><p>Achieving such a feat, in a handheld device like a phone, requires strong sensors and lenses. Those pieces of hardware aren't small or thin, thus the massive camera bump we have today. Zellweger teased that the major bump might not last forever, and that's recently come true with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">the Pixel 9a</a> reveal.</p><p>Some of you may remember Google's #BestPhonesForever ad campaign from the company's efforts to draw awareness to the similarities between its Pixel and the iPhone. A previous one we've covered involved the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-campaign-best-phones-forever">Pixel 7 Pro highlighting its ability</a> to unblur photos and capture the night sky, while also providing a VPN to users. Google also showed off the Pixel Fold, poking Apple as it's yet to create a foldable iPhone. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnKtcw5mIGUR-aMBz9AphxHzEH7Kt-azY">28 videos in total</a>, all of which feature banter between the two devices.</p>

This means you'll get the basic wireless charging compatibility but won't benefit from the improved magnetic alignment or faster speeds offered by Qi2-enabled devices.</p></article></section>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr 2025</a> family offers several upgrades, including improved batteries on some models. While the battery capacity has increased (on the Razr and Ultra models), the phones still use the original Qi standard, which remains the most common and widely supported option for wireless charging.</p><p>One benefit of Qi is that it works seamlessly with a broader range of existing chargers. In contrast, Qi2, although backward compatible, is primarily found in iPhones and a few newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">2025 Android flagship devices</a>, offering additional features, such as magnetic alignment, which none of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025 models</a> support.</p><p>Qi2 charging would have been a plus due to the magnetic alignment, which makes positioning easier and results in faster and more efficient charging. The latest charging technology reduces heat through precise alignment and helps preserve battery health over time, providing a more reliable charging experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For most Android users, the Razr 2025 lineup's lack of Qi2 likely won't be a dealbreaker. The first-gen Qi standard still provides reliable charging speeds and is suitable for everyday use, such as overnight or casual daily top-offs. Nonetheless, without Qi2's magnetic alignment, Razr 2025 model owners must be more cautious when placing the phone on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers" target="_blank">wireless charging pad</a> to ensure proper positioning.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4136px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="7bNDiJnnfpHtFReerYVuDQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-1" alt="The Razr 2025 next to the Razr 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7bNDiJnnfpHtFReerYVuDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4136" height="2327" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, why did Motorola decide not to include the Qi2 charging technology in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Motorola Razr 2025 series</a>? Talking specifically about the Razr Ultra, Motorola said that "incorporating Qi2 charging would have compromised the design due to the size of the magnet." Motorola did not specifically comment on the other Razr 2025 models, but none include Qi2 support, nor do they appear to support the Qi2 standard, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Galaxy S25 series</a>, which is "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 Ready</a>."</p><p>If you want the fastest wired charging, you'll need a Motorola TurboPower charger of 33W or higher. The Razr 2025 and Razr Plus 2025 support 15W wireless charging, while the Ultra supports 30W wireless charging, which is still plenty fast. Be cautious when using other chargers, as they are not recommended and may harm the charging performance.</p>
