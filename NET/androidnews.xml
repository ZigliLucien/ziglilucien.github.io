Yes, we're talking about those annoying texts you receive about a 'stuck package' from USPS or an "unpaid road toll" that needs your urgent attention.</p><p>These scams get victims into clicking a link and sharing personal information, often by illegally using the trademarks and logos of established companies like Google to make the fraudulent websites look like the real deal. So here's what Google is doing to fight these scams.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1716px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.84%;"><img id="NUXNyoskczshgKACg88QFC" name="Screenshot-USPS-scam-text" alt="Google launches legal action against massive scam network" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:51,l:0,cw:1716,ch:964,q:80/NUXNyoskczshgKACg88QFC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1716" height="1044" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: USPS )</span></figcaption></figure><p>The tech giant has filed a lawsuit to completely shut down a major criminal infrastructure called "Lighthouse," which is a "Phishing-as-a-Service" kit that helped criminals perform these smishing (SMS- phishing) attacks. Google says that this scam has hurt over 1 million victims in more than 120 countries.</p><p>"We are bringing claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the Lanham Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to shut it down, protecting users and other brands," the Keyword added.</p><p>In addition to courtroom battles, Google is advocating for stronger legislation (new laws) in the U.S. Congress to address the broader scam threat. "We are collaborating with policymakers and are today announcing our endorsement of key bipartisan bills in the U.S. Congress."</p><p>This includes the GUARD Act to help law enforcement fight scams targeting retirees, the Foreign Robocall Elimination Act to block illegal international calls, and the SCAM Act to counter organized scam compounds and help victims of trafficking within them.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NN3W8rRenk8gQ7AnM9VxJ6" name="Google-scam-tools" alt="Google launches new tools to keep Phishers at bay" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NN3W8rRenk8gQ7AnM9VxJ6.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, at the ground level, Google recently launched a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/googles-new-scam-fighting-tools-let-trusted-contacts-help-you-recover-your-account">couple of tools </a>designed to help users not only avoid scams but also spot them before it's too late. For instance, Google Messages will "warn you when you click on any links within it and stop you from visiting the potentially harmful website, unless you explicitly mark the message as not spam."</p><p>Additionally, it is also bringing Android's new "Key Verifier" tool that is said to keep you safe from fraudsters. It works by allowing you to scan a QR code for your trusted contacts and helps ensure your messages are private. And if you do end up losing access to your account,  "Recovery Contacts," found in Settings, users will be able to designate friends or family members they trust as recovery contacts.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Users can now have conversations with AI Mode in Search, much like they would with a store employee in person, describing exactly what they're looking for instead of typing several lines.</p><p>When you ask <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-searchs-ai-mode-is-now-giving-early-access-to-select-users">AI Mode</a> a shopping question, you’ll not only get results to your search query, but it will also give you the images along with a breakdown of other purchasing details like price, reviews, and inventory info, helping users "quickly and confidently decide what to buy."</p><p>For instance, if you need some visual inspiration, you can simply say “cozy sweaters for happy hour in warm autumn colors,” and you’ll see shoppable images.  By simply asking for "moisturizers suited to your skin type," you will be presented with multiple products, including insights from reviews (such as how a moisturizer feels on the skin), allowing for a quick understanding of the differences.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bfgCT5DCm9cYSPwekf4iaK" name="Shopping-with-Gemini" alt="Google's new AI features transform holiday shopping with 'Buy for Me' and Agentic Calling" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bfgCT5DCm9cYSPwekf4iaK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, the Gemini app will also feature these new shopping tools so you can shop even when you're chatting with the AI bot. The feature pops up when users ask a shopping-related query. Google says it will give you shopping inspiration for events like Black Friday or holiday lists, providing shoppable product listings, comparison tables, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="tgJ6266QgWM5kZgEBpkKsf" name="Gemini - Product Recommendations - Sister" alt="Google's New AI Features Transform Holiday Shopping with Buy for Me and Agentic Calling" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tgJ6266QgWM5kZgEBpkKsf.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="ai-can-get-you-real-time-inventory-status-2">AI can get you real-time inventory status </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="QB3qxpETBUmvdm7a3CDPTN" name="Agentic Calling Demo" alt="Google's New AI Features Transform Holiday Shopping with Buy for Me and Agentic Calling" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QB3qxpETBUmvdm7a3CDPTN.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's Agentic AI can now find products in stock nearby, saving you the hassle of calling multiple stores and wasting your time being on hold. When you search for products "near me" on Google Search, select "Let Google Call." AI will then call local stores on your behalf to check availability, price, and promos.</p><p>You'll receive an email or text with the answers, including local inventory from the Shopping Graph. The tech giant says that this feature uses Duplex technology, "with a big Gemini model upgrade that helps us identify the best stores to call, suggest helpful questions to ask based on the product you want and summarize the conversations into key takeaways."</p><h2 id="never-miss-a-sale-on-your-favorite-products-2">Never miss a sale on your favorite products</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1825px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="4ogijjnKyK6vgePXZaTqSj" name="Agentic Checkout" alt="Google's New AI Features Transform Holiday Shopping with Buy for Me and Agentic Calling" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ogijjnKyK6vgePXZaTqSj.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1825" height="1029" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Holiday sales can be totally overwhelming with so many stores offering huge discounts, and between all that craziness, it's easy to miss out on that dress you've been wanting forever or those pair of shoes that are only on sale for a few days. But that could change, as Google's new "agentic checkout" feature uses price-tracking to help you get desired items within your budget.</p><p>So you can get down to the specifics by tracking an item by size, color, and desired price, and you'll be notified when the price drops on Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, and select Shopify merchants. If that wasn't enough, Google will then purchase it for you on the merchant's site using Google Pay, obviously after taking necessary permissions from you. This feature combines Gemini models and the Shopping Graph, saving you time and money this holiday season.</p><p>These agentic shopping features are available in the U.S. starting today (Nov. 13), and Google says it has plans to roll them out to other countries soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That includes not just the higher refresh rate, but also a dedicated touch response chip and a new fluid frame generation feature for supported titles, such as Call of Duty Mobile.</p><p>OnePlus isn't pushing this display as ultrabright despite some obvious improvements in brightness, and the company isn't following Samsung in using an anti-glare layer on the screen, either.

Brightness and dimming methodology are paramount to eye comfort, especially when trying to use a device in a dimly lit environment. Many phones, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review" target="_blank">Pixel 10 Pro,</a> use low-frequency <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks" target="_blank">PWM dimming</a>, which can make them an uncomfortable choice for some people.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 is supremely comfortable thanks to OnePlus's use of DC dimming at medium to high brightness and 2160Hz PWM dimming at low brightness. Not only that, but the modulation rate of the display is impressively low, coming in at roughly 1/3 the rate of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>On the downside, OnePlus doesn't offer dimming options on this display, so what you see is what you get.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.47%;"><img id="WaTs2h7wMYdGGen5EY5EXg" name="oneplus-15-pwm" alt="Measuring the dimming and PWM rates of the OnePlus 15's display at varying brightness levels" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WaTs2h7wMYdGGen5EY5EXg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3024" height="1738" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OLEDs emit their own light, so, as a result, each time the image refreshes, a dip in brightness occurs. This is known as modulation. Phones like the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Pixel 10 don't attempt to control this brightness dip at all, giving them a very harsh strobing effect at 100% brightness reduction each cycle.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 efficiently manages this brightness dip to a maximum of 35%, meaning that the brightness dip is significantly less harsh and should be comfortable for most people.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ySpQSzNmfqFJoKfe9Jpn6E" name="oneplus-15-100-brightness-comparison" alt="Measuring the peak brightness of the OnePlus 15 at 100% brightness, including high brightness mode (HBM), peak HDR brightness, and with the reduce white point accessibility option enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ySpQSzNmfqFJoKfe9Jpn6E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus shipped its first-ever "reduce white point" accessibility feature with the Android 16-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-hands-on">Oxygen OS 16</a> update, which reduces the peak brightness of the display for sensitive people. I've found that leaving it at 80% white point reduction makes this the most comfortable flagship display I've used to date.</p><p>OnePlus also shipped its first-ever Motion Cues feature in Oxygen OS 16, adding moving dots to the sides of the display for people who get motion sick. It's something we've seen Honor adopt on its phones in the past year, and it's a great choice for motion sickness-prone individuals.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uzQzo6CqjvUSN2Aze3xmJE" name="oneplus-15-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-iphone-17-pro-max-sunlight-visibility" alt="Comparing sunlight visibility with an image of a golden autumn mountain on a OnePlus 15, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and an Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uzQzo6CqjvUSN2Aze3xmJE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Folks who prefer the highest peak brightness will be happy with this display. It's slightly brighter than the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display without resorting to nasty flickering PWM dimming like Samsung uses, but it's not quite as bright as the Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL's displays.</p><p>All of these displays are plenty bright for outdoor viewing, although OnePlus isn't employing an anti-glare filter like Samsung used on the S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra. Still, now that the OnePlus 15 uses a fully flat display, it should be easy enough to find a good tempered glass screen protector with an anti-glare layer applied.</p><p>And thanks to the high-frequency PWM dimming rate, viewing this one in a totally dark room won't tire your eyes out. It also gets down to 1 nit by default or as low as 0.5 nits when "reduce white point" is enabled. That's the darkest I've ever seen a smartphone display get.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:787px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="Ygieemgjy97jSwAcpuSwW4" name="oneplus-15-mura-measurement" alt="Testing for mura on the OnePlus 15's display using a uniform 50% grey image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ygieemgjy97jSwAcpuSwW4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="787" height="443" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the OnePlus 15's OLED display doesn't show any signs of mura, unlike the Galaxy S25 Ultra's display. Mura is the measurement of how uniformly pixels are lit, something that's particularly important on an OLED screen.</p><p>As you can see from the above picture, a uniform 50% grey image produces perfectly uniform pixel illumination when viewed through a macro lens. Displays with poor mura can look grainy, especially at low brightness, and have been a complaint among Galaxy S24 and S25 owners over the years.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-gaming-refresh-rate-and-resolution"><span>Gaming, refresh rate, and resolution</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="teJuePnqDLUJv62sKEucKK" name="oneplus-15-gaming-framerate" alt="Comparing gaming modes for Call of Duty Mobile on the OnePlus 15's 165Hz display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/teJuePnqDLUJv62sKEucKK.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="426" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some concerns were raised over OnePlus's decision to choose a higher refresh rate display, as it sacrificed some screen resolution. But even at a reduced resolution of 2772 x 1272 pixels — compared to 3168 x 1440 on the OnePlus 13 — it still pushes a pixel density of 450 PPI.</p><p>That's well more than "retina" resolution, and there's no chance anyone will look at this and see anything less than a gorgeous, crystal-clear high-res screen.</p><p>To enable 165Hz, you'll need to launch a supported title, swipe the OnePlus game launcher out from the sidebar, and check all the boxes to achieve maximum smoothness.

It's also the most comfortable flagship phone display I've used to date, and it achieves this metric without sacrificing image quality, resolution, smoothness, or other desirable traits.

Debuting a full two months earlier than the traditional annual release schedule, the OnePlus 15 introduces a radical new design, a faster-than-ever processor, and a promise to deliver the need for speed in every regard.</p><p>However, I can't help but feel that OnePlus lost its way a bit this year. The design mirrors the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13S</a>, a phone we called "The compact iPhone clone you never wanted." OxygenOS looks and feels more like iOS than ever out of the box — though you can change all of it, thankfully — and a handful of annoying bugs make the phone feel at least somewhat unfinished.</p><p>Additionally, the trademark Alert Slider is no longer available, replaced by a generic button that can be somewhat customized, although its usage is far more limited than it should be.</p><p>At least OnePlus is still owning the company's well-known smoothness and speed mantras, featuring the best battery life I've seen on any flagship phone to date, a gorgeous 165Hz OLED that beats everything I've tested so far, and a camera with surprisingly fantastic performance despite a hardware downgrade.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

While it's certainly got a starkly "clean" look to it, OnePlus lost too much of its identity by following iPhone design language. The alert slider is gone, replaced with a semi-customizable button called the Plus Key, which can be used for eight different functions or disabled altogether.</p><p>The default function is to interact with the Plus Mind AI-based memory storage and note-taking system, but I found that I simply never used that functionality, no matter how hard I tried. In the end, I reverted it to a way to toggle between ring/vibrate/silent modes with a long press, but I wish OnePlus had left the Alert Slider alone.

That frame is made of an amazing new ceramic-like aluminum that would feel great to hold if it weren't completely flat.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 struck a perfect balance between flat sides and curved edges, but the OnePlus 15 simply does not. It's just uncomfortable to hold. I can't wait to get a case for this phone, and that's something I <em>never</em> say.</p><p>There are also no magnets inside the phone, so you'll <em>need </em>a case to add that functionality, a disappointment that OnePlus says was necessary to fit such a massive battery inside and still keep the weight down.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap"

Hands down. Given the massive 7,300mAh battery inside, it should come as no surprise that 2-day battery life is a normal part of living with this phone, and some people will find usage into a third day before needing to charge.</p><p>To give you an understanding of how good the battery life is, I obtained some data from Future Labs, our parent company's testing department, for comparison. Note that Samsung and Apple's charging speeds are achieved by a separately sold fast charger, while the OnePlus phones use the <em>free</em> charger <em>included in the box</em>.</p><div ><table><caption>Battery rundown test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 15</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 13</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></th><th  ><p>iPhone 17 Pro Max</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Full battery drain</p></td><td  ><p>25 hours 13 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>19 hours 45 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>17 hours 14 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>14 hours 54 minutes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>30 minute charge</p></td><td  ><p>81% (5,900mAh charged)</p></td><td  ><p>92% (5,400mAh charged)</p></td><td  ><p>71% (3,500mAh charged)</p></td><td  ><p>64% (3,250mAh charged)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>OnePlus still includes the best charger in the box, offering U.S. users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-charging-speed" target="_blank">80W and global users 120W</a>, depending on the voltage your power supply operates at. That means a full charge in under 45 minutes, even with a battery that's 50% larger than most other phones, a feat that shouldn't go unnoticed.

OnePlus included a new temperature-controlling gel underneath the screen to prevent it from getting too hot, and I found it to be very effective during normal gaming sessions. This is an epic beast of a chip, and it chews through anything you throw at it like it's nothing.</p><p>The phone still cooked as high as 52 degrees Celsius during extreme benchmark testing, and I saw 3DMark crash more than once when the ambient room temperature was above 20 degrees Celsius (~72F). However, I never experienced this behavior while playing Call of Duty Mobile, Fortnite, or doing anything else on the phone. Benchmarks push hardware to its limits, though, so it's clear OnePlus needs to tweak the thermal profile on this phone a bit to prevent even niche case crashes.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-15-software"><span>OnePlus 15: Software</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fi5pZphyNydGu3VXaLrnSe" name="oneplus-15-display-lock-screen-themes-05" alt="A themed lockscreen using the OnePlus 15's built-in Flux Themes engine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fi5pZphyNydGu3VXaLrnSe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Ships with Android 16-based Oxygen OS 16, including new AI features that work impressively well.</strong></li><li><strong>Several UI default have an iOS-inspired design but can be swapped out with traditional OnePlus designs.</strong></li><li><strong>OnePlus promises 4 OS updates (to Android 20) and 6 years of security updates.</strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>-</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-photo-samples"><strong>I've already taken 100 pictures with the OnePlus 15.

Thankfully, you can change all of these silly decisions and give the phone a more distinct Android flair with a few taps.</p><p>OnePlus's AI features are all quite impressive, with a range of capabilities including text editing and generation, as well as image editing, all available on the phone. It doesn't have some of the AI generation models from a Pixel, and the built-in call screening isn't as advanced as Google's model, but I didn't have an issue with spam calls while using the phone, so I think it does a good job once enabled in dialer options.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-15-cameras"><span>OnePlus 15: Cameras</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dgRhn3Zh6GuReTk53drVsT" name="oneplus-15-camera-viewfinder-02" alt="The camera viewfinder UI on the OnePlus 15 without the orange Hasselblad button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgRhn3Zh6GuReTk53drVsT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Despite hardware downgrades on several sensors, the OnePlus 15 delivers better image quality than the OnePlus 13.</strong></li><li><strong>New features like 4k120 video recording are notable, but telephoto performance is worse than the competition beyond 30x.</strong></li></ul><p>There were some genuine concerns when the OnePlus 15's camera specs came out, including the removal of the Hasselblad branding.

using a smaller sensor, the telephoto performance is quite admirable, delivering image quality that rivals iPhone, Galaxy, and Pixel phones at most zoom levels. It's really only beyond 30x or in some rare conditions that I saw the OnePplus 15 falter, and phones like the Galaxy S25 Ultra or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-8-pro-hands-on">Honor Magic 8 Pro</a> deliver better results.</p><p>And while the new DetailMax engine does a better job of delivering even wider dynamic range, better colors, and sharper details than the OnePlus 13's more advanced sensors, the older sensors in the OnePlus 15 take longer to capture photos when lighting conditions are tough. We're talking 1-2 seconds longer for darker scenes, which isn't the end of the world, but it's certainly a worse experience.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-15-the-competition"><span>OnePlus 15: The competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="dQh26iydETxMTs6Ma7UJwQ" name="oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-13-camera-modules-02" alt="Comparing the backs of the Sand Storm OnePlus 15 with the Ocean Blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dQh26iydETxMTs6Ma7UJwQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15 features the fastest processor, the fastest charging, the best battery life, the best OLED, and the best ingress protection rating of any flagship phone you'll find today.

Now, as we head into 2026 in just under two months, Motorola has finally unveiled the 2026 Moto G Play, bringing some welcome upgrades while keeping the phone at an extremely affordable price.</p><p>The phone features a better chip, display, and battery specifications than its predecessor, all of which sound promising on paper. That said, the cost of that affordability comes in the form of some compromises, which are front and center on this phone. After all, this is still a $179 phone, so you can't expect the very best.</p><p>So, what can you expect from a phone that costs less than $200? Well, not much, but that's really the point. You're getting what you pay for, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's still quite functional and can handle the basics (with a couple of extras)... so long as you're patient.</p><h2 id="at-a-glance-2">At a glance</h2><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-2026-and-moto-g-play-2026-launch">Moto G Play 2026 launched</a> on November 4, 2025, and goes on sale through retailers and select carriers starting November 13.

To be honest, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-play-2023-review">I wasn't too impressed</a> with what Motorola provided, so I approached this review with some apprehension. Fortunately, I can say that my time with the Moto G Play 2026 hasn't been a terrible experience.</p><p>Part of this is a result of the upgrades Motorola introduced with the 2026 model. The MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset is the very same one that powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>. It's a chipset that worked quite well on that phone, and here it at least makes the performance more manageable than the last Play I reviewed. It also brings 5G connectivity, which is surprisingly a first for the Play series, and a welcome spec for a $179 phone in the year of our lord 2025.</p><p>The display also got a bump to a 120Hz refresh rate. Unfortunately, the resolution is still just HD+, but that has rarely been a concern for me in my use, and I feel like the smoother refresh rate makes up for it. You'll still have to deal with rather large bezels, but the LCD panel is bright enough at 1,000 nits.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Che6rUQMREhe5fGGqz98Nj" name="Moto-G-Play-2026-review-6" alt="Moto G Play 2026 display outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Che6rUQMREhe5fGGqz98Nj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the standout features of the Moto G Play 2026 is its impressive battery life. Motorola says the 5,200mAh battery should keep this phone going for up to two days, and while I haven't quite reached that, I easily get more than a day of use. In fact, I average about nine hours of screen-on time, which is something I can't claim with too many phones.</p><p>On the software front, the phone runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box.

This also applies to gaming, which is not this phone's strong suit.</p><p>In fact, this is probably the first time I've recommended keeping the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">RAM Boost</a> feature on.

Setting up the phone nearly filled up the 64GB of internal storage, some of which is taken up by the Android software.

I had to uninstall a few apps after the initial setup and disable a gaming folder (which is really just a way to serve ads for games you can install). The Glance lock screen is here, too, although it wasn't enabled by default, which I appreciated.</p><p>Additionally, the phone is also inexplicably missing some of my favorite software gestures.

If you can't manage, consider other options for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">Android phones under $200</a>, particularly older models that may perform just as well or better.</p><p>The Moto G Play 2026 doesn't feel like a bad phone; it just feels like a $179 phone. In that sense, you're getting exactly what you pay for, meaning you take the good with the bad. If you're looking for a temporary phone, a first phone for a young child, or a burner phone, this could be a suitable option. Just make sure you purchase a microSD card with it.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9ce138d8-268d-4b4b-8393-fd22ffc26354">            <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/en/p/phones/moto-g/moto-g-play-2026/pmipmja42mq" data-model-name="Moto G Play 2026" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgnA3NaRP6aQV8ffkBGfuD.jpg' alt="Moto G Play 2026 render front and back"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Motorola</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Moto G Play 2026</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Cheapest way to play</strong></em></p><p>The Moto G Play 2026 brings 5G speeds and two-day battery life to an ultra-affordable price tag, complete with a comfortable vegan leather back and even a headphone jack.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How many rear camera sensors does the Moto G Play 2026 have?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>While is looks like it has three camera sensors, the Moto G Play 2026 has one optical 32MP sensor and an ambient light sensor.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Is the Moto G Play 2026 waterproof?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The Moto G Play 2026 isn't waterproof, but it has minimal water resistance, thanks to the IP52 rating.

The Galaxy Z Fold 7 brought notable upgrades such as a slimmer build, wider cover display, and lighter body, while the Galaxy Z Flip 7, despite featuring a larger cover screen and a newer Snapdragon chipset, offered fewer overall improvements.</p><p>Samsung now plans to change that with the Galaxy Z Flip 8. The company reportedly expects the Z Flip 8 to outsell the Z Fold 8, with insiders calling it "the key to next year's increase in foldable sales." Samsung is targeting about a 10% increase in foldable sales overall compared to this year.</p><p>This development comes as Apple is reportedly gearing up to launch its first foldable phone next year. The Cupertino company has been working on its foldable device for several years, and with its launch expected next year, Samsung is aiming to counter it by delivering major design and consumer-focused improvements in its upcoming foldables.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, these tests don't tend to be indicative of real-world use as they're performed on reference devices optimized to get the best scores, so I wanted to wait and see if there's any noticeable difference on consumer-facing devices powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>.</p><p>Although there was a little bit of a wait, I've managed to do just that, thanks to the Redmagic 11 Pro. The phone is among the initial wave of devices featuring the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, the phone serves as a good indicator as to just what the Qualcomm chipset is capable of, and after a week of testing and daily use, it's evident that this is the fastest mobile chipset available today.</p><p>And while I'm sharing testing data of the Redmagic 11 Pro, that isn't the only device based on Qualcomm's latest silicon I have on hand — there are two other phones I've been using alongside it, but as they're yet to launch, I can't talk about them just yet.

There's a smaller year-on-year increase in 3DMark scores, but again, it is in line with the gains Qualcomm has delivered with every new generation over the last three years.</p><p>Interestingly, there's just a 5% difference between the Redmagic 11 Pro and the MediaTek Dimensity 9500-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">Vivo X300 Pro</a>, and that alone illustrates just how good the latest Arm cores are this year — they're able to hold their own against Qualcomm's custom design. It's a similar situation with 3DMark, and the ray tracing enabled Solay Bay test has both the Redmagic 11 Pro and Vivo X300 Pro on a level playing field.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.70%;"><img id="rcJq6g3FrXH6vabXiVUcvD" name="Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5" alt="Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rcJq6g3FrXH6vabXiVUcvD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4037" height="2289" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But there's a problem: overheating. The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 manages to get hotter than the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which I didn't think was possible. The difference is noticeable while gaming, and even on a phone with liquid cooling like the Redmagic 11 Pro, the thermals got so high that it was just uncomfortable to hold the device.</p><p>In fact, the Redmagic 11 Pro just shut down in the middle of 3DMark's Steel Nomad Light stress test as it overheated, and this is with the built-in fan running at its highest setting and liquid cooling active. I noticed the same thing on another Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5-powered device I'm testing, so this is clearly something Qualcomm needs to look into.</p><p>While the issue isn't as extreme in regular gaming scenarios, the Redmagic 11 Pro exceeds 52 degrees in extended gaming, and it got a few degrees hotter than its predecessor. To put that into context, I didn't see any of these issues with the Vivo X300 Pro, with the device staying under 45 degrees during marathon gaming sessions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rCriBuxGPiceGQR68GGa8V" name="Redmagic 11 Pro" alt="Redmagic 11 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rCriBuxGPiceGQR68GGa8V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The solution? Most Android manufacturers will likely have a much more conversative thermal threshold that throttles the Qualcomm silicon before it can overheat. This is what I noticed in most 2025 phones powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and there really isn't much more that can be done to manage the thermals.</p><p>Even in phones with dedicated thermal management systems, there just isn't enough surface area to effectively spread out the heat generated by the chipset, so all manufacturers resort to some level of throttling. It's almost a given that we will see the same in 2026 flagships — at least those powered by Qualcomm.</p><p>So while Qualcomm once again has the fastest mobile chipset, it's a Pyrrhic victory. The overheating issue curtails the excitement associated with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and if anything, the Dimensity 9500 is looking like a much more balanced platform this time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Apple Watches have 5G connectivity, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a> LTE has satellite SOS support; Samsung's upside is that it typically charges half as much as its rivals for the cellular upgrade.</p><p>Right now, you can essentially get the 4G LTE upgrade for the Watch 8 Classic for "free." On Amazon, the standard Bluetooth Watch 8 Classic is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Rotating-Coaching/dp/B0F7Q5RB96">$469</a> ($30 off), while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Rotating-Coaching/dp/B0F7PXV6LS"><strong>Watch 8 Classic LTE is </strong><em><strong>also</strong></em><strong> $469 ($80 off)</strong></a>, an all-time low according to Camelcamelcamel.</p><p>You'll find a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartwatch-Titanium-Advanced-Coaching/dp/B0F7PYZ44K">$80-off</a> discount on the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025), which includes LTE, if you're willing to spend another $100 for a titanium case and longer battery life for cellular tasks. But the Classic is the more affordable option, with better controls and similar perks.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="12b8100f-8cd9-4b1d-9c32-781a23d4bb95" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" data-dimension48="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" data-dimension25="$469.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartwatch-Rotating-Coaching-Warranty/dp/B0F7PXV6LS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1663px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Mg4S8RRy6Xjk2kULqjLYiC" name="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic cropped render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mg4S8RRy6Xjk2kULqjLYiC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1663" height="1663" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review" data-dimension112="12b8100f-8cd9-4b1d-9c32-781a23d4bb95" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" data-dimension48="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" data-dimension25="$469.99">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a> has the most striking design of Samsung's 2025 watches, with a rotating steel bezel that's more exact for One UI Watch navigation than the normal Watch 8's touch bezel. And at $80 off, it's not too much more expensive than the $400 Galaxy Watch 8 LTE, if you want a more "classic" design, doubled storage, and a third button for shortcuts.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Smartwatch-Rotating-Coaching-Warranty/dp/B0F7PXV6LS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="12b8100f-8cd9-4b1d-9c32-781a23d4bb95" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" data-dimension48="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" data-dimension25="$469.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You prefer Galaxy Watches in general for their four years of updates, seamless One UI 8 Watch Tiles and tools, and Samsung Health insights; you prefer physical controls and traditional style, and don't mind the extra weight required for them.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want faster 5G connectivity or satellite connectivity in cellular dead zones; you'd wouldn't mind picking a lighter, cheaper model without the same chic, or a pricier model to get an extra day or two of battery life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JJvqnaStEhfDsFrJVNRjL8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Heritage-Classic-watch-face" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a woman's wrist showing the Heritage Classic watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JJvqnaStEhfDsFrJVNRjL8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We may end up seeing a cheaper Galaxy Watch 8 Classic deal once Black Friday or Cyber Monday rolls around, but this deal is worth jumping on if you've been waiting for a good LTE smartwatch. The only real question for Android phone owners is if the Pixel Watch 4 LTE is a better fit.</p><p>Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic">Pixel Watch 4 vs. Galaxy Watch 8 Classic guide</a> offers an in-depth comparison, but the gist is that Google's watch is less rugged, heavy, and "classically" styled, with a crown instead of a bezel. Both have Wear OS 6, but Google's stock version focuses more on stylish transitions and magnified content at the center of the domed display.  It performed surprisingly well in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-battery-test">LTE battery life tests</a>, and the emergency SOS feature is a nice bonus.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 LTE costs about the same as this Galaxy Watch 8 Classic deal, but we'd recommend the more expensive 45mm option, which is $499 at full price. So if you'd prefer Google's option, you may want to wait until Black Friday for its first major discount.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-7">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Samsung Galaxy deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Video generation models aren't new. Artificial intelligence has been able to create realistic video content for a while, and consumer tools are readily available. Both Google and OpenAI have released Veo and Sora text-to-video and image-to-video generation models in the past. So, why is the technology only blowing up now with the launch of OpenAI's Sora app?</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Sora is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/best-android-ai-apps">AI video-generation app</a> from OpenAI that combines a generator and social platform in one. It launched for iOS and on the web in September and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/sora-app-on-android-now-available"> recently debuted for Android</a>. Chances are, even if you haven't heard of Sora, you've probably seen a video from it shared on another platform, like X or TikTok.</p><p>Sora is on its way to becoming a household name for OpenAI in the same way ChatGPT did two years ago. It's succeeding and starting to infiltrate pop culture in a way Google's Veo video-generation models haven't. After trying both Veo 3 and Sora 2, it's clear that OpenAI is winning the generative video race by going all-in on presentation — and removing as many limitations as possible.</p><h2 id="veo-3-and-sora-2-are-both-hyper-realistic-video-generation-models-2">Veo 3 and Sora 2 are both hyper-realistic video generation models</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8frHjNfcAY7re76LitBndd" name="Veo-3-vs-Sora-2" alt="The start pages for Gemini (Veo 3) and Sora." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8frHjNfcAY7re76LitBndd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI video generation models like Veo 3 and Sora 2 face an uphill battle. Simply making an excellent, hyper-realistic video generator isn't enough to be successful. Brands like Google and OpenAI need to make AI videos <em>cool</em>, and I wasn't sure that was possible until the Sora app launched.</p><p>By wrapping the Sora 2 model in a TikTok-like social feed and adding human cameos, OpenAI seemingly changed the perception of AI content overnight — what was once slop and garbage became funny and engaging. That has nothing to do with the model itself, but rather, the interface.</p><p>Sora, like Gemini, is both a model and an interface. Sora 2 is the video-generation model powering the experience, and OpenAI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/sora-2/" target="_blank">says</a> it is "more physically accurate, realistic, and more controllable than prior systems." The company adds that it thinks Sora 2 "may be the GPT‑3.5 moment for video."</p><p>That sounds a lot like Google's claims regarding Veo 3.1, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-steps-up-its-creativity-in-3-1-version-update-for-realism">just rolled out to the Gemini app</a> in October. Google said Veo 3.1 adds "richer audio, more narrative control, and enhanced realism." It's pretty similar to what OpenAI touted about Sora 2 a month earlier.</p><p>Why hasn't Veo 3 surged in popularity like Sora 2? It's because Google doesn't have an app to tie it all together.</p><h2 id="openai-s-sora-app-turns-ai-video-generation-into-a-social-platform-2">OpenAI's Sora app turns AI video generation into a social platform</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cNzRcmrU9RMM8LuemU9bXd" name="Veo-3-vs-Sora-3" alt="The Sora app on iOS showing the camera feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cNzRcmrU9RMM8LuemU9bXd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's Veo 3 model, while technically as capable as Sora 2, is often positioned more toward developers and businesses than the average consumer. It's accessible in the Gemini app for Google AI Pro or Ultra subscribers, and it powers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/photos-to-video-in-google-photos-gets-veo-3-upgrade">photo-to-video generation in the Google Photos app</a>. Even those implementations are ones the user needs to seek out — they're not a major part of either app.</p><p>By comparison, Sora 2 is available at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sora.chatgpt.com" target="_blank">sora.com</a>, but OpenAI also built an entire app around it. The company noticed the vertical video and infinite scroll formats working for social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and others. It responded by making the Sora app a similar hub for AI-generated videos and a place where users can make their own.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LS9x8W3WfNYXAMLKyYJiod" name="Veo-3-vs-Sora-5" alt="Trying to generate a realistic video with Gemini and Sora." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LS9x8W3WfNYXAMLKyYJiod.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A core part of the Sora experience is the cameo feature, which allows users to make realistic AI videos of themselves or others. These can eventually be shared with others via the Sora feed. The idea is that you connect with your friends on Sora, create AI cameos, and share them, so that everyone has a TikTok-like feed of clever AI content.</p><p>Comparing Veo and Sora quickly revealed that OpenAI's approach with cameos immediately separates it from the competition. At a time when many video generators are blocking the creation of AI video content about real people, OpenAI made it Sora's entire reason to exist. There <em>are </em>limitations to prevent people from using Sora irresponsibly, but they end up feeling more like detours than outright roadblocks.</p><p>Here's what OpenAI says about how people can protect their likeness within Sora:</p><div><blockquote><p>Only you decide who can use your cameo, and you can revoke access or remove any video that includes it at any time. Videos containing cameos of you, including drafts created by other people, are viewable by you at any time.</p><p>OpenAI</p></blockquote></div><p>Still, these are looser restrictions than what you'll find using Veo 3 with Gemini. People are unsurprisingly always trying to find ways around them, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pcDKqmTuoJiqt5rqzT8vJd" name="Veo-3-vs-Sora-6" alt="Gemini refusing to generate a video of Mark Cuban, while Sora encouraging it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pcDKqmTuoJiqt5rqzT8vJd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While testing Veo 3 and Sora, I struggled to get Gemini to create anything realistic involving actual people or celebrities.

Oddly enough, there's nothing in there that specifically bars generating videos of real people, but Gemini and Veo models are clearly trained against it.</p><p>This puts Google and Veo 3 in a precarious position because Sora's popularity proves people crave realistic AI videos of actual people.</p><h2 id="are-google-s-strict-policy-guardrails-holding-its-ai-features-back-2">Are Google's strict policy guardrails holding its AI features back? </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="35LBckLVTZJUkZ5BUEBtwd" name="Veo-3-vs-Sora-4" alt="The Sora app on iOS showing its AI content advisory." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/35LBckLVTZJUkZ5BUEBtwd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OpenAI's headfirst dive into lifelike AI videos represents a sharp contrast to Google's insistence on AI responsibility. I can't say for certain why OpenAI is starting to bend the lines, but after following the AI industry closely for years, I have a theory — AI development is plateauing, and OpenAI's competitors are catching up.</p><p>Shortly after announcing Sora, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, said in October 2025 that ChatGPT would soon be allowed to engage in "erotica for verified adults" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-erotica-chatgpt-openai-sam-altman-d52e00cedf34a8120af7af66981da295" target="_blank">AP</a>). Altman added that OpenAI is "not the elected moral police of the world."</p><p>These are separate decisions, but as a whole, they appear to show OpenAI systematically removing guardrails for its AI products. By letting Sora go all-in on AI videos of real people, OpenAI created an instant hit. Meanwhile, Veo is still relatively unknown to the masses.</p><p>To me, AI videos are still slop, regardless of whether Veo or Sora makes them. Who knows if OpenAI's bet on Sora, social, and cameos will pay off? But for now, it's hard to argue with early results — the Sora app has already been downloaded millions of times across iOS and Android.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is Google Veo?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Veo is a text-to-video model developed by Google that enables users to create high-quality, realistic short video clips based on text prompts.

However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/android-gaming-handhelds-are-having-their-steam-deck-moment">Winlator </a>has been taking over the space, quickly becoming the default recommendation for many. The problem with Winlator is that it's far from user-friendly, and can easily trip up those who have a bit more technological knowledge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vnqGhoadne2MgfqhH7bwSX" name="rog-ally-x-legion-go-s-odin-2-pocket-dmg-gaming" alt="Ayaneo Pocket DMG emulating Switch, Odin 2 with Winlator, Balatro on Legion Go S, and Bazzite on ROG Ally X" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnqGhoadne2MgfqhH7bwSX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Installing one game means hours spent configuring each VM, downloading the necessary game files, transferring them to your phone or tablet, then waiting for the install to finish. And once everything is done, keep your fingers crossed that the game will just load, because of it doesn't, get ready to set aside some time for tinkering.</p><p>At one point, Winlator was a fully open-source project, meaning that anyone could clone the GitHub repo and re-release the app on their own. That's where GameSir comes in, as it's done exactly that with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-retro-gaming-and-emulation-community-needs-to-take-a-deep-breath">GameHub</a>. The emulator also integrates features from similar projects like Pluvia and GameNative, which let you sign into your Steam account and download games.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NZVaGcV7pT4LvEjqyzKcTX" name="close-up-gamesir-gamehub-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Emulation on Android devices with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, AYANEO Pocket DMG, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NZVaGcV7pT4LvEjqyzKcTX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When going through the process of installing games, GameHub detects what hardware you're using and then downloads the necessary files that are (hopefully) the most compatible. But even if they aren't, or if there's an updated Turnip driver released, you can download and install it right from the app. GameHub ultimately simplifies the entire process, removing a lot of the headache of trying to get Winlator set up.</p><p>GameHub was technically first released earlier this year, but until now, the only way to download the emulator was through the dedicated website. Given the current rigmarole surrounding the future of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/sideloading-apps-onto-android-phones-from-random-sources-wont-be-an-option-starting-in-2026">sideloading on Android</a>, it might not be long before this method is no longer viable. Thankfully, GameSir is getting ahead of the curve by releasing GameHub onto the Play Store.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3940px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="U6ywQvQqGi6QM44pPCG8oY" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-review-1.jpg" alt="Fallout 4 running on the Ayaneo Pocket S with the Steam Deck OLED" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6ywQvQqGi6QM44pPCG8oY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3940" height="2216" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, it's worth noting that there are two major differences between the Play Store version and the version available directly. The first of which is the removal of external storage support, which is a downright bummer, and we're hoping to see this changed in the future. The other is that you're not able to load Windows games into the GameHub app yourself, so you'll want to wait until you're on a stable network before trying to install any games.</p><p>Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd be able to play modern Windows games natively on my Android phones, tablets or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>.

For instance, ahead of this year's Black Friday, Best Buy is offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/motorola-edge-512gb-2023-unlocked-interstellar-black/J39QWY93Q8" target="_blank"><strong>up to $500 off the 512GB version of the Motorola Edge Plus (2023)</strong></a><strong> </strong>when buyers let the retailer connect it to a carrier, or $400 off when they do it themselves.</p><p>We lauded the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus (2023)</a> upon its release for its design and functionality, and it definitely served as the best flagship phone Motorola had released in several years. While there are now two newer versions of the device, this particular deal is for the larger 512GB version of the phone, and it's hard to beat that or its other features at this price point.</p><p>Motorola launched the 2023 Edge Plus with one of the industry's most eye-friendly displays and powerful performance. Despite being from a couple of years ago, buyers will get four years of software updates, meaning that there is some level of future-proofing baked into the older phone.</p><p>To be sure, newer versions of the Motorola Edge Plus have built on this phone's success as a 2023 flagship, though they've also built this into the price tag, which is why many find deals on older phones like these preferable to going with newer ones.</p><ul><li><em><strong></strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025" target="_blank"><em><strong>Check out these other Motorola phone deals that are worth checking out for Black Friday, and save up to 50%</strong></em></a><strong></strong></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/motorola-edge-512gb-2023-unlocked-interstellar-black/J39QWY93Q8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="MC9BYyhDua27wPx6EETXga" name="motorola edge plus 2023 reco 600x600.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MC9BYyhDua27wPx6EETXga.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>2023 Motorola Edge Plus (512GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/motorola-edge-512gb-2023-unlocked-interstellar-black/J39QWY93Q8" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$799.99</del> <strong>$299.99 with activation at Best Buy for early Black Friday</strong></a></p><p>Buyers can get up to $500 off the 512GB storage configuration of the 2023 Motorola Edge Plus as part of <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-buy-black-friday-deals-2025">Best Buy's early Black Friday sale</a>, so long as they let the retailer activate the phone for them. Even if they don't, they can still get $400 off, marking a 50% discount, on a phone that was especially well-liked when it was released. The 2023 edition of the Motorola Edge Plus still holds up fairly well today, boasting a long battery life, a thin, sleek design, and an eye-friendly display that still has some other companies beat, even in 2025.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/motorola-edge-512gb-2023-unlocked-interstellar-black/J39QWY93Q8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a capable Motorola phone this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> and you don't mind going with an older model to save some extra money; battery life is a major selling point for you when it comes to buying a phone; you need something with smooth, quick performance, even when gaming or performing other power-intensive activities.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you'd prefer to upgrade to the 2024 or 2025 versions of the Motorola Edge Plus, and you have the budget to spend more on a phone; you need a phone with a telephoto lens that has more than 2x zoom; you don't need 512GB of storage and you'd rather go with a newer phone with less storage capacity.</p><p>The 2023 Motorola Edge Plus was easily one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones</a> available when it was released. And while there are more than a few new phones on the block, price cuts like these highlight how consumers may stand to save a lot of money without compromising quality, just by going with an old device.</p><p>The 2023 Edge Plus features a roughly two-day battery life, 68W fast charging, and it has a good-looking, eye-friendly 6.7-inch pOLED display with a 165Hz refresh rate.</p><p>The overall design of the phone is well-liked for how thin it is and for the inclusion of the curved bezel. Other perks of the phone include its camera features, such as Horizon Lock, and the user-friendly My UX.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-12">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Samsung deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It can also display info on multiple visual layers, so quick AI prompts appear in the foreground while navigation or notes sit subtly behind them.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.70%;"><img id="3j2mkGWzFUoy45RJYwwvj3" name="Even-G2-smart-glasses" alt="Even G2 smart glasses close up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3j2mkGWzFUoy45RJYwwvj3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Even Realities)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.70%;"><img id="Kars7boG6NfJpSx4ubsSMn" name="Even-G2-smart-glasses" alt="Even G2 smart glasses and R1 ring on a lap" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kars7boG6NfJpSx4ubsSMn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Even Realities)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.36%;"><img id="jrD6JJnVqgszDCPd3ctQ5k" name="Even-G2-smart-glasses" alt="Even G2 smart glasses on the face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrD6JJnVqgszDCPd3ctQ5k.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1318" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Even Realities)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Unlike many smart glasses, the G2 skips cameras and speakers entirely, so there's no recording or unwanted audio. It is built with aerospace-grade titanium and magnesium alloy to keep it featherweight at 36 grams, with IP67 dust and water resistance. Battery life lasts over two days on one charge, and the compact case offers seven full recharges.</p><p>On the software side, G2 introduces Conversate, a feature that listens to conversations (with your consent) and helps you keep up with topics, context, and follow-ups. The glasses also refine popular tools like Teleprompt, Translate (supporting 29 languages), and Navigate, now with a built-in geomagnetic sensor for better orientation.</p><h2 id="control-on-your-finger-2">Control on your finger</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SCAsDrxeboEfT4inVE7bkD" name="Even-R1-smart-ring" alt="Even R1 smart ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SCAsDrxeboEfT4inVE7bkD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Even Realities)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XBACSycPfgv4o8dpQt3LZD" name="Even-R1-smart-ring" alt="Even R1 smart ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XBACSycPfgv4o8dpQt3LZD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Even Realities)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Then there’s the new Even R1 Smart Ring, which doubles as a discreet controller for the G2 and a health tracker. Made from zirconia ceramic and medical-grade stainless steel, it handles navigation gestures and offers real-time wellness insights. Its TriSync system connects with the G2 and your phone, so it does not feel like another gadget to manage.</p><p>Both devices go on sale on November 12 at EvenRealities.com for $599 for the G2 and $249 for the R1. For a limited time, buyers can grab the R1 and accessories for 50% off when bundled with the G2.</p><p>Later this year, Even Realities plans to launch Even Hub, a developer platform where creators can build new experiences for the G1 and G2 in an effort to open its ecosystem to community-driven innovation.</p> ]]></dc:content>

IT will also run Android 16 out of the box, which is a given at this point.

Although Google has already made customizing and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/first-things-to-do-with-the-google-pixel-10">personalizing Pixel phones easy</a>, one element you still cannot disable or hide from the home screen is the At a Glance widget.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-at-a-glance-widget-could-help-you-follow-sports-scores-on-your-pixel">At a Glance widget</a> is quite useful as it shows important information like your boarding gate and time before a flight, weather updates for the coming days, or calendar events. However, it also takes up a significant amount of space on the home screen. And, for those who do not use it or simply want more room, it looks like Google will finally allow users to remove this widget.</p><h2 id="pixel-users-may-finally-be-able-to-hide-at-a-glance-widget-2">Pixel users may finally be able to hide At a Glance widget</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3195px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="5s4RosAAHGFybvAQfYxGcK" name="Google-Pixel-6-Pro-At-a-Glance-connected-devices-galaxy-buds.jpg" alt="The Pixel 6 Pro At a Glance widget displaying connected devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5s4RosAAHGFybvAQfYxGcK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3195" height="1798" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-at-a-glance-remove-from-home-screen-option-3614939/">Android Authority</a>, the new Android Canary build adds a "Show on home screen" toggle in the At a Glance settings. This suggests Google will soon let users hide the widget from their home screen. Currently, as reported by the publication, disabling the feature does not change anything, but it indicates that Google is developing it behind the scenes.</p><p>There is no confirmed timeline for when this feature will roll out or whether it will make it to the final Android build. However, since it has appeared in the Canary version, it is reasonable to expect it sometime in the future. We will keep you updated if and when it arrives on Pixel phones.</p><p>As useful as the widget is, this change would certainly give Pixel users more customization options. People have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1cnwb2a/why_is_there_no_way_to_remove_at_a_glance_widget/">asking for this for years</a>, and many have switched to third-party launchers for that reason, but that may no longer be necessary.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, one of the most noteworthy additions in this update is Google Maps' new Power Saving Mode.</p><p>This new Power Saving Mode, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-is-testing-a-battery-saving-mode-youve-always-needed">as previously rumored</a>, allows you to view live navigation in Google Maps on a dimly lit screen that uses less power while still displaying most of the navigation interface. It works similarly to the Always-on Display mode on Pixel phones, but specifically for Maps.</p><p>However, even though Google announced this feature as part of its November Feature Drop, it is exclusive to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a>. The reason behind this is unknown at the moment, but it means you will not be able to use this feature even if you have last year's Pixel 9 or previous Pixel 8 or Pixel 7 models.</p><h2 id="a-battery-friendly-maps-mode-you-probably-can-t-use-2">A battery-friendly Maps mode you probably can't use</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="25kXR7jBzszajx2d7YmYg9" name="google-maps-psv" alt="Google Maps' power-saving mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/25kXR7jBzszajx2d7YmYg9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Moreover, as noted by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16711572">Google Support page</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-maps-power-saving-mode-pixel-10-3614181/">Android Authority</a>), this feature works only while in driving navigation mode on the Pixel 10 series. It does not support other types of navigation, such as walking or biking directions.</p><p>It is disappointing that Google is keeping this feature exclusive to the Pixel 10 series. Though it is likely because the new Power Saving Mode in Google Maps uses a feature called "AOD Min Mode" that allows apps to tap into Android's Always-on Display to show apps as full-screen activities while consuming less power with dim brightness, fewer colors, and a lower refresh rate.</p><p>This feature is a part of Android, and any app can use it, but Google has decided to make the feature unavailable on older Pixel phones. Though similar to other Pixel-exclusive features, it may arrive on other Pixel phones in the future.</p><p>That said, if you have the latest Pixel 10 series phone, you will be able to use this feature once it rolls out widely. To access it, just press the power button during navigation to start the new Power Saving Mode in Maps and view navigation in the new always-on display style instead of the usual clock and lock screen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It is available for recent Pixel phones, including the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10</a> series, and foldables.</p><p>The latest beta release is still on the October 2025 security patch, which shows Google is focusing on stability rather than new system-level features this time.</p><p>As you may already know, QPR (Quarterly Platform Release) updates usually include small refinements before a stable public release, and this point update is no different. Beta 3.3’s changelog lists a fix for a lock-screen issue where devices could freeze or become unresponsive after waking.</p><h2 id="squashes-a-major-lock-screen-freeze-2">Squashes a major lock-screen freeze</h2><p>The bug (Issue #457527675) has caused random freezes that required users to restart their phones to fix, so many Pixel owners will be glad it’s resolved. Earlier beta versions, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-rolls-out-bootloader-fix-in-android-16-qpr2-beta-3-1">Android 16 Beta 3.1</a>, also fixed bootloop issues for Pixel users.</p><p>As this is primarily a stability update with one critical bug fix, users shouldn’t expect visual or functional overhauls. That said, those enrolled in the Android Beta Program can grab the over-the-air (OTA) update starting today.</p><p>The rollout should gradually make its way to all eligible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>, though users can head over to Settings > System > Software update to check for it. If you haven’t enrolled in the beta program yet, Google’s beta site still offers an easy sign-up process. Just keep in mind that beta software can occasionally introduce minor quirks.</p><p>While Android 16’s QPR2 Beta 3.3 might not look exciting on paper, it brings us a step closer to the full release expected later this year, possibly in December. If you’ve been dealing with lock-screen glitches or random slowdowns, installing this update should make your Pixel feel noticeably smoother.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, that showcase was limited, with the device displayed behind glass and no media or attendees allowed to go hands-on. Samsung also did not reveal any additional details about the device at the conference. Now, it appears the company is ready to launch the device in the market.</p><p>According to the Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2025/11/12/5HVVWAXXMZF5HAPTH4LBK4FA4M/">Chosun Biz</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1988545779410391510">@UniverseIce on X</a>), Samsung is planning to host a launch event for the Galaxy Z TriFold on December 5, 2025, in Korea.

There are plenty of new features as well, and one that I like is the new app drawer. It doesn't look any different to previous years — other than a search bar located at the bottom — but it has new a few new tricks.</p><p>You get the usual alphabetized sorting in the app drawer, but this time when you tap on a letter, it pulls up all the apps starting with that letter without you having to scroll down to that section. This makes launching apps that much easier, and is just a nice addition. I now find myself just using this option instead of scrolling the app drawer, and it's even faster than using the search bar.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="X8KaRyzK2dkKhMruhiUYzM" name="ColorOS 16 on Find X9 Pro" alt="ColorOS 16 on Find X9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X8KaRyzK2dkKhMruhiUYzM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another plus point is that when you launch an app this way and exit it, you'll go to the home screen. That isn't the case when you scroll down the app drawer and launch an app; in this situation, you go back to that position within the drawer when you exit the app. OPPO introduced this with ColorOS 15, and after a year of use, I still don't like it. Thankfully, with the easier way to sort and launch apps, this hasn't proved to be a problem on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LveFHA2LzFx5jQC9GUrQEN" name="ColorOS 16 on Find X9 Pro" alt="ColorOS 16 on Find X9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LveFHA2LzFx5jQC9GUrQEN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Alongside the feature, ColorOS 16 has auto-categorization of apps. Xiaomi did this on its phones for several years, but with ColorOS 16, OPPO is emulating iOS, offering identical functionality. Basically, apps are sorted into folders automatically, and you can then drag these folders around as needed. Thankfully, this exists as a standalone pane called Categories, and if you don't like the feature, you don't need to use it at all.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BnZp5sCogNEy4oYRwPMN6N" name="ColorOS 16 on Find X9 Pro" alt="ColorOS 16 on Find X9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BnZp5sCogNEy4oYRwPMN6N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I get that tweaking the app drawer is a minor thing, but it makes a noticeable difference in daily use. It is particularly evident when going back to a Pixel; I recently tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-pro-fold-may-not-be-the-best-foldable-but-its-the-one-i-like-the-most">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, and using the app drawer on the foldable feels archaic — Google doesn't even have alphabetized sorting. Yes, I know it can be triggered by pressing down on the scroll bar, but it is usually a hassle, and it isn't anywhere as smooth or convenient to use as OPPO's implementation within ColorOS 16.</p><p>It's clear that Android brands are paying greater attention to what their rivals are doing — you'll just need to see the design similarities between Vivo's OriginOS 6, Xiaomi's software, and ColorOS 16 to know that — and I want other Android manufacturers to steal ColorOS 16's app drawer and integrate it into their own devices.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's the question long-time Garmin fans may have to answer soon, based on a report suggesting that "ongoing Garmin hardware work" is in progress toward a rotating crown with a magnetic sensor.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2025/11/09/garmin-rotating-crown/">Gadgets & Wearables</a> shared this news, explaining that the Hall effect sensor wouldn't rely on mechanical parts or a physical connection, making it easier for Garmin to preserve its watches' water resistance. For context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a> uses a Hall sensor for its rotating crown.</p><p>Garmin's main fitness and smartwatch rivals have used crowns for years, which made Garmin's button-heavy designs a point of pride and comfort for its fans. They're slower to press but more dependable than sweaty touchscreen swipes, without the finicky accidental turns you get when a crown bumps into something; they're also more accessible for left-handed athletes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HFDdUzCEvCKoxe3Mdccmwe" name="Garmin-watch-with-rotating-crown.jpg" alt="A mockup render of a Garmin watch showing a rotating crown embedded into a rugged design." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HFDdUzCEvCKoxe3Mdccmwe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gadgets & Wearables)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The alleged design would sport two left-side buttons and a single right-side crown. Assuming the above mockup is accurate, it would be similar to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a>'s or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-2-hands-on-accuracy-test">Suunto Race 2</a>'s centered crown, rather than the top-right placement you get on a COROS or Apple Watch.</p><p>There are dozens of Garmin watch subbrands, and even if this report is accurate, there's no guarantee Garmin will ditch Up/ Down buttons on its Fenix, Forerunner, or Instinct watches. Garmin may only use them on its "mainstream" lineups, aka updating the two-button <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-fitness-heart-rate-steps">Venu 4</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a> with crowns.</p><p>On the other hand, we've seen how AMOLED displays started with the Venu series and then took over <em>most</em> Garmin watches over the past few years, despite the outcry from MIP display fans who took pride in Garmin's use of this less-popular tech.</p><p>The MIP vs. AMOLED debate had passionate athletes on both sides, whereas I'm not certain how many Garmin watch fans have been clamoring for a crown. If this report proves accurate, we may see our first Garmin watch with a crown relatively soon; the reaction will depend on <em>which</em> lineup gets the crown.</p><h2 id="the-main-thing-a-garmin-watch-with-a-crown-would-need-2">The main thing a Garmin watch with a crown would need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="d9sAsGozfYqTxRFHAQC9fM" name="COROS-APEX-4-turn-by-turn-navigation" alt="A photo of the COROS APEX 4 on the author's wrist showing a topographic map with turn-by-turn navigation showing a right turn in 387 feet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d9sAsGozfYqTxRFHAQC9fM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Putting a crown on a Garmin watch would have <em>some</em> upsides. When it comes to map navigation, I prefer COROS watches because zooming in and out is significantly easier with a crown than with buttons. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-nomad-3-has-impressed-me-as-fun-garmin-instinct-3-rival">COROS NOMAD</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-4-fitness-test-and-first-impressions">APEX 4</a> are excellent hiking companions, whether I'm following a route or just checking what trails are nearby.</p><p>Of course, only premium Garmin models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a> even <em>have</em> maps, and hardcore Garmin/ button fans are the most likely to buy these. If the Garmin Fenix 9 introduces the crown next year, that could be a big risk, considering Garmin's stock took a big hit because, among other things, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-pro-vs-fenix-8">Fenix 8 Pro</a> sales were lower than anticipated.</p><p>Let's assume Garmin <em>does</em> give its flagship watches a crown. I think it would only work if Garmin accompanied it with a significant processor or memory boost. Garmin watches, packed with features while optimized for long battery life, have felt a bit <em>laggy</em> this generation, especially when scrolling through maps, and speedier crown scrolling would expose this.</p><p>Ideally, Garmin would take this opportunity to boost performance a bit, while maintaining the same battery life that Garmin fans expect.</p><h2 id="why-garmin-might-go-down-this-route-2">Why Garmin might go down this route</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ikzBFsdFCJgjTtP7VBhkAn" name="Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-Garmin-Fenix-8-run-activities" alt="The Garmin Fenix 8 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, both showing Run activity start screens." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ikzBFsdFCJgjTtP7VBhkAn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a runner in a warm-climate area, I don't have the same issues with a crown as other athletes will. Turning a crown is harder with gloves in cold-weather regions, and if it juts out too far, it can interfere with certain bodyweight or gym exercises. Even if buttons are more deliberate to press, they're a safer choice, one Garmin has relied on for a decade.</p><p>So why would Garmin ignore your likely ambivalence to a crown? Because Garmin already <em>has</em> your business. It needs to satisfy shareholders by continuing to grow its audience, stealing them away from Apple and Samsung. And quite simply, those users might be more comfortable with a crown than buttons. It's the same reason AMOLED displays have become the norm.</p><p>We shouldn't get too riled up by a single unconfirmed report, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> may stick to five-button layouts for years to come. But the report is plausible, and it wouldn't shock me if we see our first Garmin crown in 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The new OTA update, most importantly, fixes one of the most critical bugs affecting Pixel smartphones.</p><p>Google today (Nov 11) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/386109819/google-pixel-update-november-2025?hl=en&sjid=6820244845885047423-NC">shared details</a> about what users can expect from the November 2025 security patch for Pixel devices. Similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-october-security-patch-continues-to-fix-haunting-display-problems">October 2025 update</a>, the Pixel 6 series is missing from the list of supported devices.

The build number for the Pixel 7a to Pixel 9 series is <strong>BP3A.251105.015</strong>, while for the Pixel 10 models it is <strong>BD3A.251105.010.E1</strong>.</p><p>While the November Feature Drop adds many new features to Pixel devices, the list of bug fixes and stability improvements isn't long. However, Google notes that the November security patch resolves an issue with emergency calling functionality.</p><p>Some users recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1oeiqop/pixel_9_pro_wont_call_911/">reported</a> on Reddit that they were unable to contact emergency services from their Pixel devices despite having full signal strength, as the call wouldn't connect.

Google is also promising improvements for general charging and battery usage with the new update. The remainder of the fixes are as follows:</p><ul><li>A fix for an audio issue causing occasional system instability and slowdowns in certain conditions.</li><li>A fix for an issue preventing some apps from loading properly.</li><li>A fix for an issue where webcam mode doesn’t function correctly with connected devices.</li></ul><p>While the focus right now is on the November Feature Drop that introduces several new and useful features like Theme Packs app for Pixel devices and a new AI-powered notification summary feature, these security and bug fixes continue to address important issues for Pixel owners.</p><p>If you have a Pixel smartphone, you can check for updates by going to <strong>Settings > System > Software updates > System update > Check for update</strong>.

I tested all the models in this range, starting with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft1-new-king-of-budget-headphones">FT1</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft1-pro-best-budget-planar-headphones">FT1 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft3-review">FT3</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-ft5-review">FT5</a>, and now the FT7. As the naming indicates, the FT7 sits at the pinnacle of the range, and the design and planar drivers indicate as much.</p><p>The FT7 is now available globally, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-Headphones-Open-Back-Diaphragm-Detachable/dp/B0F2J4FKRZ/">costs $699 on Amazon U.S.</a> as of writing. Obviously, that's costlier than the $499 retail price of the FT5 and double that of the budget-focused FT3 and FT1 models, but as is always the case with Fiio, you get an incredible value.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PUkXrSg3M3PtS3P6FpQSZj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUkXrSg3M3PtS3P6FpQSZj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Starting with the design, the FT7 retains a similar aesthetic as its siblings, but the design is different. The headset uses a carbon reinforced chassis, and going this route clearly made a difference to the weight, with the FT7 coming in at 427g, 29g lighter than the 456g of the FT5. Even if the numbers indicate the lightness of the headset, it feels lighter than its sizing suggests; in a sense, this is the opposite problem of what you get with Audeze's products.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AWtUik7pSAKVp4UyKA5TZj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AWtUik7pSAKVp4UyKA5TZj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Build quality itself is phenomenal, and the FT7 looks every bit like a high-end headset. It is considerably bigger than the FT5, and that has to do with the size of the planar drivers. As a result, this isn't a headset you can take outside — it's designed to be used for indoor listening.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nAozsA7ZUQeh4jw8y6fEcj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nAozsA7ZUQeh4jw8y6fEcj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iBBNLHxpj6E8uRwZGdzUZj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iBBNLHxpj6E8uRwZGdzUZj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The design itself feels elegant, and the outside of the earcups is decked out in wood, and looks pretty good. The large grilles do a good job showcasing the planar drivers housed inside, and like the chassis, the headband uses a carbon construction.

The lightweight design ensures there's no fatigue even with extended use, and there isn't much in the way of clamping force. If anything, the FT7 sits snugly against your head, and you don't feel like you're wearing a headset that's quite as big as the design indicates. To give you some context, I tested the FT7 alongside Audeze's new LCD-S20, and Fiio did a better job with the comfort of the headset.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9NsKJfhV8nVZV94h8PfLbj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9NsKJfhV8nVZV94h8PfLbj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ewWcfCaX6nUCRGSZLWqhXj" name="Fiio FT7" alt="Fiio FT7 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ewWcfCaX6nUCRGSZLWqhXj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>You get leather ear pads installed by default, and Fiio also bundles fabric pads in the box.

There's good rumble and energy, and the headset does better than the FT5 in this regard. The mids are clean and have good texture, with instrument ensembles and vocals shining through. There's good treble extension as well, particularly with the leather pads. I didn't notice any harshness, and if you want a more balanced sound, I'd suggest switching to the fabric pads.</p><p>The soundstage is incredibly expansive, and you get a level of immersion that's not often found in this category. Overall, Fiio did an outstanding job with the design and tuning of the FT7, and the pricing is thoroughly justified.

One of the most surprising offers I've seen comes from Verizon, which will give you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/"><strong>a free Samsung Galaxy S25, Galaxy Watch 8, AND a Galaxy Tab if you bundle the three devices</strong></a> and add respective service lines. </p><p>No trade-in is required, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon</a> won't even force you to use the most expensive data plans to receive the savings. Even lower-priced tiers like Verizon's myPlan and the Unlimited Welcome plan will land you the three free Samsung devices, just be sure to add all three items to the same cart. Only new customers and existing Verizon customers who add a new line with a port-in are eligible for the deal, but if you can make it work for you, it's almost like getting all of your holiday shopping done at once! </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><em><strong>See the full list of Black Friday deals at Verizon</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b266e783-390d-4816-b5d9-1e9236f21fa4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Verizon Black Friday Bundle: Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines" data-dimension48="Verizon Black Friday Bundle: Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:502px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.97%;"><img id="qVDakRZaDJo6VZFZcF8dxR" name="samsung-galaxy-phone-tab-watch-bundle-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qVDakRZaDJo6VZFZcF8dxR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="502" height="537" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Verizon Black Friday Bundle: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" data-dimension112="b266e783-390d-4816-b5d9-1e9236f21fa4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Verizon Black Friday Bundle: Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines" data-dimension48="Verizon Black Friday Bundle: Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines" data-dimension25=""><strong>Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines</strong></a></p><p>Just in time for Black Friday, Verizon is running a deal that will get you a free <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, Galaxy Watch 8, AND a Samsung tablet, and all you need to do is pay for the new data plans.

The free devices included in the deal are some of the best that Samsung has to offer. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, for instance, is powered by the ultra-efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, plus you get 12GB of RAM, seven years of software support, and all of the latest Galaxy AI software features. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch 8</a> is no slouch either, coming complete with a stylish, ultra-comfy design, Wear OS 6, and a suite of comprehensive health and fitness tracking features. Not interested in these devices? Verizon is also running similar bundle deals for Apple and Pixel, so take your pick. Needless to say, Black Friday is sure to come with a multitude of excellent Android deals in tow, but if you don't want to wait, Verizon has you covered. </p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-17">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Samsung Galaxy deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The tech giant announced that a whole host of features is coming to Pixel 6 to the Pixel 10 series.</p><p>The update brings a mix of fresh AI tools, safety upgrades, and a themed makeover inspired by Wicked. Whether you’re rocking an older Pixel or the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, there’s something in here to play with.</p><p>One of the standout additions is Remix in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>, a creative new feature powered by Google’s Gemini Nano Banana model. It lets you reimagine photos inside a chat. You and your friends can pass the same image back and forth, tweaking and remixing it without ever leaving the conversation.</p><p>The feature launches first for RCS users in English-speaking countries including the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, India, Ireland, and New Zealand.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.48%;"><img id="PnRxq5BeNa5uCA6jQhhxcG" name="Pixel-Drop-Google-Messages-Remix" alt="Remix in Google Messages showing a dog with various AI-generated versions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PnRxq5BeNa5uCA6jQhhxcG.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1046" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="wicked-themed-customization-2">Wicked-themed customization</h2><p>If you're fond of customization, there’s the new “Wicked: For Good” theme pack.

Notification Summaries, coming to Pixel 9 and newer (except the 9a), automatically condense long group chats into quick recaps right in your notification shade. A follow-up feature arriving in December promises to take things further by automatically quieting less important alerts, helping you focus on what matters.</p><h2 id="scam-protection-gets-tougher-2">Scam protection gets tougher</h2><p>On the security front, Scam Detection for messages can now flag suspicious chat notifications in popular apps on Pixel 6 and newer models. It checks message content and shows a “Likely scam” alert before you open the app. Google is also expanding call scam detection, which listens for scam-like speech during calls, to more regions like the UK, Ireland, India, Australia, and Canada.</p><p>For Pixel 9 and newer, Call Notes is also expanding internationally. The feature uses on-device AI to record and summarize calls, turning them into searchable notes with action items, making follow-ups less of a chore.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5739jzRC6N2xzgfNPxxLpb" name="November-Pixel-Drop-features" alt="Pixel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5739jzRC6N2xzgfNPxxLpb.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ALjyZgYFrq2vCbZpgtfrfb" name="November-Pixel-Drop-features" alt="Google Maps power saving mode showing minimal interface during navigation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ALjyZgYFrq2vCbZpgtfrfb.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.00%;"><img id="LiGGrojEpAFfNrzLiakDrb" name="November-Pixel-Drop-features" alt="Pixel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LiGGrojEpAFfNrzLiakDrb.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="krULDBviXgNKFpsi9PxLwb" name="November-Pixel-Drop-features" alt="Pixel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/krULDBviXgNKFpsi9PxLwb.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google Photos is also getting Personalized Edits.

I've had a question all this time: how do you guys decide what is worth writing about? I don't mean news and updated information because that's a given. I mean, the other content about what you all like or what you think needs to change. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Surely you're not just writing what you want, and there has to be some sort of process. If you can share anything about it, I think it would be very interesting.</strong></em></p><p>Hi Jane, thanks for the interesting question. It's nice to step away from wires and tubes and things that go beep every now and then.</p><p>I'm going to preface this by saying this is about <strong>me</strong>. We're all writers and Android enthusiasts here at Android Central, but more importantly, we're individuals. We each have our own process of getting an idea from the back corner of our mind onto the web's virtual paper.</p><p>I'll also skip some obvious things. If there is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news">news</a> out there, it will get written because people want to read it. The same goes for announcements from the companies that build all this stuff; when Samsung or Motorola has something to share, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">it's always worth sharing</a>.</p><p>Once we're past that part, things are a little more free-form. The most important thing to me is that <strong>we</strong> care about something (we, meaning both you, the reader, and I). I could spend all day writing about fishing poles or how to change the spark plugs on a Volkswagen, but would you read it?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-titaniumsilverblue-s25plus-navy-s25-icyblue" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25, next to each other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8256" height="4644" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The second most important thing is that I have a clue. I don't write about finances, for example, because I don't follow how much companies are earning or spending, as it holds no interest to me. Anything I would write wouldn't be nearly as interesting as it would be if someone enthusiastic about the subject tackled it. We both deserve better.</p><p>Finally, some of my interests are tech-adjacent but not really a great fit for an Android website. I love DIY and project electronics, so the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> is one of my favorite products. I'll occasionally share a great deal with you, but I don't have the time to spend explaining how to use it and build a smart device or a reef aquarium controller. Or even a phone. I know, because I've done it, and very few people read it.</p><p>When all the dust settles, I hope I can share some information that's interesting and helpful. Helping people is important to me.</p><h2 id="we-write-about-what-we-love-2">We write about what we love</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hiofJ5eS93tG6WTpCKssnN" name="linux-on-pixelbook-go-16x9.jpg" alt="Linux terminal on Pixelbook Go" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hiofJ5eS93tG6WTpCKssnN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Within reason, of course.</p><p>If you take a minute to notice it, you'll find that the writers here have an obvious love of different things. When the right person writes about something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">VR glasses</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/sunday-runday">health and fitness</a>, it shows, and the articles are exceptional.</p><p>I'm not interested in how a company is building the next generation of super microprocessor that can power things 30% faster. I'm curious about optimizing the existing software to make it more efficient and run 30% faster than it currently does. Without the software, all these gadgets are just a hunk of metal and wires.</p><p>I'm also super interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>. They have the potential to do anything and everything with the right infrastructure, yet they're often dirt cheap. A powerful product that's accessible to everyone beats a $5,000 MacBook every time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1299px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.96%;"><img id="VH3fnBtYZxXpXdaf4nd2KJ" name="Android-Central-columns" alt="A list of some Android Central columns" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VH3fnBtYZxXpXdaf4nd2KJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1299" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a little off the beaten track, but I want to try to do my part in holding all these companies accountable, too. Google, Apple, Samsung, and others provide us with the products we love, often making our lives easier. But there is always a cost, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-vs-disney-when-big-companies-fight-consumers-lose">things need to be equitable</a>. If you're forced to give up more than something is worth, or when these seemingly above-the-rules tech companies are out of line, I want to mention it. And there's always plenty of that going on.</p><p>Finally, there is the whole Apple thing. "<em>Who cares about Apple? This is an Android website!</em>" is something I get to hear all of the time. Here's an answer: <strong>I care about Apple</strong>. I also care about Microsoft and Amazon. These companies are driving and shaping the future of our tech. I'll never use an iPhone; I tried it, hated it (though I think the older Mac Mini was the best PC ever). When Apple makes a change to the iPhone that affects consumers or consumer technology in general, that's important, particularly because of the sheer number of people using the product.</p><h2 id="we-re-a-service-provider-2">We're a service provider</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="rMBmQxWTmVoB7xjzPDAZkN" name="Lenovo Tab M11 lifestyle" alt="Lenovo Tab M11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rMBmQxWTmVoB7xjzPDAZkN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the end of the day, we're here for you.

Like most Motorola phones, it also features the vegan leather, anti-slip backing, and the latest edition of the phone comes with a MIL-STD-810H durability rating, meaning that it's rated even for military standard durability.

It also boasts a slightly better suite of cameras, faster charging speeds, higher wireless standards, and some of the latest Motorola software features available. While it doesn't usually go on sale as much as the 2024 version, this is a solid price for those hoping to get a newer release.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-amazon-deals-2025" target="_blank"><strong>Check out our ultimate guide to Amazon's early Black Friday deals!</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Stylus-Unlocked-Gibraltar/dp/B0DWV55DXH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1112px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:115.83%;"><img id="8MUigJMAtb2rabW3B3tdvm" name="motorola-moto-g-stylus-2025-product-image.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MUigJMAtb2rabW3B3tdvm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1112" height="1288" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Motorola Moto G Stylus (2025):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Stylus-Unlocked-Gibraltar/dp/B0DWV55DXH" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$399.99</del> <strong>$299.99 at Amazon for the Early Black Friday sale</strong></a></p><p>Amazon's early Black Friday sale has cut 25% off the price of this year's Motorola Moto G Stylus, marking $100 in savings.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the years, one of my biggest complaints about foldable phones has been that while many of these have all of the bells and whistles, they usually fall short in the camera department. When you spend between $1,500 and $2,000+ on a phone, you would expect it to feature the best hardware across the board, but that simply hasn't been the case.</p><p>Even with how drastic an overhaul the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-one-year-later">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> received last year, it still didn't offer the same camera features as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. Sadly, this is also the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, as the camera hardware is practically identical to its predecessor.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

Not to mention that foldable phones that are available abroad, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a>, usually don't suffer from the same issues, at least not usually.</p><p>With that, I ventured out and took a bunch of pictures with all four foldable phones in an effort to see how well the Pixel 10 Pro Fold compared. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I want to note that all of the pictures you see were taken with the default settings. The images were not manipulated in any way to provide the most balanced comparison possible.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7"><span>Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2BGrrFpboUdovnBzoVz4MA" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-galaxy-z-fold-7-1" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera comparisons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2BGrrFpboUdovnBzoVz4MA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We'll kick off this camera showdown with the two phones that many are likely considering as we head into the holiday season. It's also an interesting comparison because while Google didn't really do much in the way of upgrades, Samsung took the opposite approach with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-comparison">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. However, even with the new 200MP sensor, I'm not sure that it's really all <em>that much</em> better than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Right off the bat, we get the patented Samsung saturation, albeit not as pronounced as I've become accustomed to. It's saturated enough to notice compared to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but it's not like the picture looks bad by any means. That said, the 10 Pro Fold took a picture that was a bit more true-to-life, and a bit brighter, even if it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q8N6TsaU8w9XYXMbNMp5XA" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-galaxy-z-fold-7-3" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera comparisons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q8N6TsaU8w9XYXMbNMp5XA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The picture of the tree has me feeling a bit perplexed, as the tree from the Fold 7 doesn't stand out quite as much, and it's not until you look at the grass behind the tree that you see a clear difference. To be honest, this was one of the closer pictures to judge, as both phones do a good job at capturing what I was actually seeing.</p><p>This picture below really surprised me. To my eyes, the Pixel is more vibrant and captures more detail than the Z Fold 7, which is not what I was expecting.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n73daLW5ZmHMyAYfVq5wcA" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-galaxy-z-fold-7-4" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera comparisons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n73daLW5ZmHMyAYfVq5wcA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a fall picture with lots of bright colors, so I assumed Samsung's saturation processing would rear its ugly head. If anything, I'd probably go so far as to say that the picture is a little blown out, especially when you look at the trees and leaves around the steps in the background.</p><p>Naturally seeing as I'm a sucker for having a phone with a good telephoto camera, I also snapped a few shots with each of the phones. Unfortunately, this is where the Galaxy Z Fold 7 fell, and fell hard. It's immediately apparent in every image, but especially so with pictures that have text in them.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aqh2a7SzLmucmnPaS3CnDA" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-galaxy-z-fold-7-2" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera comparisons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aqh2a7SzLmucmnPaS3CnDA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gpwxciqCHjEp9F7bmqBAPA" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-galaxy-z-fold-7-5" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera comparisons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gpwxciqCHjEp9F7bmqBAPA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4D7rVF9cxNBQKCP2qumTKA" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-galaxy-z-fold-7-10" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera comparisons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4D7rVF9cxNBQKCP2qumTKA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The entire picture just looks like it's an attempt at being AI generated, while the Pixel looks crisp and clean without much artifacting at all.

Thanks to Android Central's Nick Sutrich, I've been able to spend some time with the Magic V5 and was able to include it in this camera comparison. And let me tell, this phone might just the most perplexing of them all.</p><p>The image above looks like Honor took Samsung's old image processing algorithm and cranked the saturation up to 11. Like the Fold 7, it's not that the picture from the Magic V5 looks inherently bad, as the colors do pop, especially on the mural. However, if I were to make any edits, dialing back the saturation would be the first thing I'd do.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rbSLPx2rmUbJvQZa4hKcsL" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-honor-magic-v5-3" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Honor Magic V5 camera comparisons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rbSLPx2rmUbJvQZa4hKcsL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's where things get weird. In the picture of the tree, it's like I jumped in a time machine and went back at least a few years. The V5 clearly didn't know what to do with all of the various colors and the grey sky, so it just blew everything out. As a result, there's hardly any definition, and the picture just looks...bad.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TCkevg5Jhr324Dtgqt9GzL" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-honor-magic-v5-4" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Honor Magic V5 camera comparisons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TCkevg5Jhr324Dtgqt9GzL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Then</em>, there's the picture above of the park bench, and it's like a completely different phone took the picture.

The built-in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">Type-C cable</a> can get awkward to use, but it's so convenient to have. You don't have to worry about packing a separate cable.</p><p>At $36.99, the KraftGeek PowerShutter is an absolute steal. It's a fantastic alternative to the more premium Belkin Stage PowerGrip.

Arriving this week, OPPO says owners of a Find N3, Find N3 Flip, or a Find N3 Pad 3 Pro can expect the major Android OS upgrade to begin on November 11.</p><p>Moreover, the company is stacking its update rollout schedule, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, and the Find X8 have already started receiving it, as of November 6.</p><p>OPPO states that while these dates are when it will begin pushing the update, consumers shouldn't expect it that day (but if it arrives, then lovely!). The community post says that ColorOS 16 is rolling out "in batches," meaning that it could take a few days to a few weeks before <em>everyone </em>receives it. The main takeaway here is that ColorOS 16 should at least hit your phone or foldable or tablet at some point in November.</p><p>OPPO's ColorOS 16 update closely mirrors what OnePlus folks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygenos-16-arrives-as-a-software-that-truly-knows-you">got with OxygenOS 16</a>.

The patch was announced for users in India first; however, it's expected to soon spread across to more regions as we move through November. Among the highlights, OxygenOS 16 brings a revamped UI experience that's designed to be much smoother and fluid than before.</p><p>OnePlus states it's reworked its visuals, as well as refreshed apps, AI, and more. The Mind Assistant, hitting the OnePlus 12, is capable of getting you to your saved content even faster. Even the past-gen device's camera is receiving some updates, as the company introduces better controls to help users get those creative juices flowing and into reality.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The app is a universal hub for location sharing and tracking of items, devices, and people. In the latest Find Hub app update on the Google Play Store, Google adds a redesigned account menu and dedicated toggle for units of distance measurement.</p><p>The new Find Hub app update is version 3.1.458, and starting to roll out as of Monday, Nov. 10. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/10/find-hub-device-list/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> spotted the updated Find Hub app that includes a <strong>Distance units </strong>menu for the first time. Here, users can customize the unit of measurement Find Hub uses to display distance and location data.</p><p>The fresh menu has four choices available, including a <strong>Use default</strong> setting that will follow your Android device's system setting.

Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything.</p><p>Often, it's good to take a step back and see what's inside that pretty package. Was it worth what you paid for it? Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Early Black Friday sales</a> are already here, and we'll see even more in the next few weeks.

You will find great deals at places like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/walmart-black-friday">Walmart</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-buy-black-friday">Best Buy</a>, too, but Amazon has a gazillion tech products, and it seems like they all get a Black Friday deal worth looking at.</p><p>Some of the best deals will be for Amazon's own products, like an Echo or the Fire line of tablets. It seems that Amazon is willing to lose money selling these because the company knows they will encourage you to use Amazon services more. That's not a bad strategy if your company can afford it, and Amazon certainly can.</p><p>But let's be honest: these products aren't for everyone. They are only worth buying if they are something you'll use. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-and-nest-are-making-smart-home-feel-smarter-matter">Google's Nest</a> line of smart home products is, in my opinion, miles ahead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-echo-flex-review">Amazon's Echo and Alexa</a>. But if you <em>use</em> Alexa, the Echo is a much better buy. And plenty of people do.</p><p>Before you buy anything, you should ignore the deal and the low price and ask yourself if you'll use it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-makes-the-fire-tablet-a-good-fit"><span>What makes the Fire Tablet a good fit?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1775px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="NAoRynxHhVPTNCv3xvni5m" name="amazon-fire-hd-10-plus-docked.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire HD 10 Plus using Show Mode in Dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NAoRynxHhVPTNCv3xvni5m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1775" height="998" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is no right way or wrong way to use a tablet, but there are different ways to use one.</p><p>If you want a bigger screen with longer battery life to consume, Amazon's Fire tablets might be for you. Especially if you're already (or thinking of becoming) an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-share-amazon-prime-friends-and-family">Amazon Prime</a> subscriber.</p><p>You can watch movies, TV shows, and videos on any modern tablet, even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-prime-video-getting-shuffle-button-too">Amazon's Prime Video</a> offerings. But if this is your primary use case, like it is for a lot of folks, then a new Fire HD makes it easy, and you'll have a lot of money left to buy more and more of that content. You aren't missing anything; you don't need a stupid-crazy powerful Apple processor or a world-class Samsung display to watch a movie on the couch. You need quick and easy access to the content, and Amazon offers it.</p><p>What about the kids? I think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Amazon's Fire Kids tablets</a> are one of the best things a parent can buy for their child. I will say that there is nothing you can do with one that can't be done on something like a Galaxy Tab or a OnePlus tablet, but the parental controls over what the kiddos have access to are dead simple on the Fire Kids versions. Simple means <em><strong>you'll do it</strong></em>, keeping the things you don't want your kids to see away. Until they get smart enough to work around it all anyway.</p><p>There are a few gray areas, too. Gaming is a big one. If you want the best gaming experience or love to play intense and demanding games, the Fire isn't the best way to do it. If you want to play more mobile-style games or the kids want to play <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-game-review-minecraft-pocket-edition">Minecraft</a>, well, the Fire tablet is a winner because it's more than adequate and usually about one-third of the price.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-don-t-buy-a-fire-tab-and-expect-everything"><span>Don't buy a Fire Tab and expect everything</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7toEJcBHissLb7zzLyXyUg" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-18.jpg" alt="Help me write in Google Docs on Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7toEJcBHissLb7zzLyXyUg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there are things the Fire Tab isn't good at doing. When it comes to productivity, things like working with spreadsheets or doing homework, nothing beats a good Android tablet. And yes, I say that as an iPad user. Don't be shocked, I use what fits me best.</p><p>A good Galaxy Tab or even a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/forget-what-you-may-have-heard-chromebooks-are-actually-great-productivity-machines">Chromebook</a> with a great touchscreen is the way to get work done because the software is there. Yes, my iPad can be more responsive, and I can buy a special Pencil. But <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-ui-leaks-better-writing-and-search-on-android">Google Docs</a> is integrated into Android and Chrome devices in ways that make it a better experience.</p><p>If you are thinking of going all in and using a tablet for your entire mobile computing needs, well, the Fire Tab isn't going to cut it. Buy yourself a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/i-dont-think-tablets-can-get-any-better-than-the-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra">Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</a> or an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro</a> and call it done.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-ve-got-one-and-love-it"><span>I've got one and love it</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Z3Y4XPexD2Hy7GgUGBJoaD" name="amazon-fire-hd-10-plus-landscape-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire HD 10 Plus promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z3Y4XPexD2Hy7GgUGBJoaD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm not a big tablet user. I lean towards a Chromebook if I need more screen space than my phone offers, but I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-2023-vs-fire-hd-10-plus">Fire HD 10</a>. I bought it <em>because</em> it was on sale for crazy cheap, too, when the newer model came out.</p><p>It makes a perfect device for packing into a bag or the back of the passenger seat on a trip where sitting and staring out the window for hundreds of miles is mind-numbingly boring. Take the time to download a few hours of video, and you have instant entertainment. You can even do things like check your email in a pinch if you left your phone behind.</p><p>I wouldn't bring an expensive tablet on every road trip because I don't want to risk losing or damaging it. A Tab S is fine for a hotel room where things are clean and safe, but camping out of the back of a truck screams Fire HD to me. It won't mind a little bit of dirt, and if something crazy does happen, I'm not out $800.</p><p>Sometimes, it's the right device, and if any of this rings true with you, yeah.

Wake locks allow apps to keep your device’s CPU awake, even when the screen is off, to run background tasks. While some wake locks are necessary, like playing music or completing app downloads, others can silently drain your battery.</p><p>The new system is meant to pinpoint apps that hold more than two cumulative hours of non-exempt wake locks in a 24-hour period as excessive. If 5% of an app’s user sessions over the last 28 days fall into this category, the app is considered to have bad battery behavior.</p><p>For users, this means apps that were quietly draining battery in the background could soon be flagged directly in their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play-download-manage-apps">Google Play Store</a> listing page.</p><h2 id="play-store-public-shame-2">Play Store public shame</h2><p>Starting March 1, 2026, apps that exceed this threshold may have reduced visibility on “prominent discovery surfaces,” such as recommendations. More importantly for users, Google will place a red warning label on app listings that reads: “This app may use more battery than expected due to high background activity.”</p><p>This warning will hopefully make it clear which apps might be the culprits behind unexpected battery drain, so users can take actions like adjusting permissions, restricting background activity, or choosing alternatives.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:802px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:89.65%;"><img id="ZXDQVBJrBniNKMzae2xWLe" name="Play-Store-warning-for-battery-draining-apps" alt="Play Store warning highlighting a battery-draining app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZXDQVBJrBniNKMzae2xWLe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="802" height="719" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google developed the metric in collaboration with Samsung, combining real-world device data and insights into user experience to make the algorithm as accurate as possible.</p><p>As time goes on, users should see fewer apps keeping their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> awake for no reason, better performance, and less unexpected battery drain. Even before the March deadline, this new metric gives users a warning about apps with high background activity, helping them make better choices.</p><p>Hopefully, apps will be encouraged to use less background activity, and users will finally get a better look at what’s happening on their phones. If you’ve ever wondered why your battery drops overnight or when your phone is idle, help is coming soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to a new rumor, the company is working on a phone with a 240Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Launched in China last month, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> features a 165Hz refresh rate and a 1.5K display, which is a noticeable change from the previous model’s 2K, 120Hz screen. As a result, the phone is getting attention for its strong performance and reasonable price, although some fans view the lower resolution as a downgrade. It is said that OnePlus may have reduced the resolution to make motion smoother.</p><p>The discussion heats up after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnePlusClub/status/1987144850471604482" target="_blank">OnePlus Club</a> account on X claimed the company wants to find a “perfect balance” between high resolution and a 240Hz dynamic refresh rate in future phones.</p><p>There’s no official word yet on which model will get this high-refresh screen, but rumors suggest it could be the OnePlus 16 or 17.</p><p>The idea of a 240Hz refresh rate is getting mixed reactions online, as indicated by the responses to OnePlus Club’s X post. Some people wonder if it’s really the upgrade users need at the moment, since most apps and videos won’t use it, while others think it could make gaming and scrolling much smoother than ever before.</p><h2 id="the-inevitable-compromise-2">The inevitable compromise</h2><p>There are trade-offs, of course, if this idea becomes a reality. A 240Hz display would most likely use more power and reduce battery life, even if it makes motion look smoother. Some critics say OnePlus should focus on better cameras or longer battery life instead of just increasing the refresh rate, and this is echoed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/1okm81s/im_getting_mixed_feelings_on_the_brand_new_15s/" target="_blank">people on Reddit</a> who’ve found the OnePlus 15 camera lacking in many ways.</p><p>On the other hand, our own Nicholas Sutrich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-photo-samples">liked the phone's shooters in his first impression</a>, noting that the new DetailMax Engine seems to fix the aggressive Hasselblad processing with the OnePlus 13.</p><p>Even so, the thought of almost instant response times for gaming, app use, and swiping is appealing, and it could set a new standard for high-performance phone screens.</p><p>It’s still unclear if people will like this feature or see it as an overkill. What’s certain is that OnePlus seems to be willing to try new things with display technology, even if it means rethinking usual priorities like resolution and battery life.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tech giant is bringing its Gemini-like modern redesign to this feature after what seems like forever.</p><p>What was once four multicolored dots is now going to look a lot like its Live Search UI, but with some changes to animation and the overall response from the Search bot (as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/07/google-voice-search-redesign/">9to5 Google</a>).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1464px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.64%;"><img id="8ru4aQXqcyQXgogzGQSjth" name="Google-Voice-search-redesign" alt="Google voice search redesign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ru4aQXqcyQXgogzGQSjth.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1464" height="756" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see in the GIF below, the ‘G’ logo is a lot more centered now, and the “What’s on your mind?” prompt transitions into the transcript. The earlier compact waveform has been replaced by an arc that vibrates with speech. The "search a song" prompt remains at the bottom of the screen, and once users click on it, the words "Play, Sing, Hum" take over the center part of the screen as opposed to the circular orb that would move based on your voice.</p><p>Additionally, Google has also changed the sound associated with the search feature. The sound for an active microphone, which used to be a "ping," has been changed to match the sound used for voice search on AI Mode.</p><p>The tech giant seems to be aiming at keeping the UI more consistent and easier to understand.

A new leak suggests Samsung is reworking parts of the phone’s design, particularly the front camera, but not necessarily in a way everyone will cheer for.</p><p>The latest rumored change is a larger front-facing camera cutout, possibly about 4mm wide, according to leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1987865298242818269" target="_blank">@UniverseIce on X</a>. If true, this would be the largest Infinity-O hole ever on a Samsung Ultra model, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s26-ultra-could-have-the-widest-infinity-o-camera-cutout-yet/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> points out.</p><p>As per the leaker, the change is supposedly meant to accommodate a wider field of view, increasing from about 80 degrees on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> to roughly 85 degrees. In theory, that means you’ll be able to fit even more into your selfies or group shots without stretching your arm as far.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:96.91%;"><img id="TBmmGQMMv3etnRK4Uj6AW3" name="Galaxy-S26-Ultra-front-camera-cutout" alt="side by side comparison of the front camera cutout on the Galaxy S25 Ultra (right) and S26 Ultra (left)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TBmmGQMMv3etnRK4Uj6AW3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="680" height="659" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @UniverseIce / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, the actual front camera hardware might not see any real upgrades. The resolution and sensor could stay the same as before, meaning you’ll get a wider frame but not necessarily a better image overall.</p><p>This change shows a curious change to Samsung’s design approach. For years, Samsung has made its punch-hole cameras smaller to create a more immersive display. Now, the Galaxy S26 Ultra might be moving in the opposite direction.</p><h2 id="rear-camera-tweaks-2">Rear camera tweaks</h2><p>For the rear cameras, Samsung seems to be making small improvements instead of big changes. The S26 Ultra is said to retain the same 200MP main camera and 50MP ultra-wide lens as the S25 Ultra.</p><p>The telephoto system might change a bit, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-points-to-a-sweet-camera-upgrade-for-your-close-up-shots">3x telephoto lens</a> possibly using a new 12MP ISOCELL S5K3LD sensor instead of the older IMX754, as per the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1986626916661731732" target="_blank">tipster</a>. While this sounds like an upgrade, the new sensor is actually smaller at 1/3.94" compared to 1/3.52", which could slightly reduce how much light it captures.</p><p>The 5x periscope zoom could get a wider aperture, changing from f/3.4 to f/2.9, which should help with low-light photos. There are also rumors about a new APV video codec that might make videos more efficient and higher quality, but this is still unconfirmed.</p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1987135260321325060" target="_blank">earlier rumor</a> claims the Galaxy S26 Ultra may look slimmer and include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-qi2-chargers-in-the-us">Qi2 wireless charging</a>, but the larger Infinity-O cutout will likely be more noticeable. Samsung usually prefers symmetry and minimalism in its designs, so some people might see this larger punch-hole as a negative move.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If the rumors are true, Samsung has multiple prototype design in the works for models like the base Galaxy S26. The company was said to be working on a Galaxy S26 Pro model with an enhanced feature set, but the latest leaks indicate Samsung is playing it safe instead, opting to release a regular Galaxy S26 instead.</p><p>The developing situation is resulting in rumors and leaks that each paint different pictures. Last week, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> rumor claimed the upcoming smartphone would be considerably thinner than the current Samsung Galaxy S25. The reported thickness was 6.96mm, and 10.23mm including the camera bump. Now, an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-specs" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> report claims the latest prototype is 7.24mm thick.</p><p>The exact dimensions of the Galaxy S26 prototype are said to be 149.5 x 71.6 x 7.24mm. Compared to the report from last week, this new Galaxy S26 prototype is wider, taller, and thicker. Notably, the latest Galaxy S26 prototype appears much thicker than the previously-rumored figure, but it's only marginally thicker than the 7.2mm Galaxy S25.</p><p>There aren't any pictures or renderings of the updated Galaxy S26 design available at the moment. We don't know whether this will be the final revision, but as the Galaxy S26's expected launch window creeps closer, it becomes more likely. Following conflicting reports of a delayed launch, it looks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-qi2-chargers-in-the-us">the Galaxy S26 series will debut in late January</a>.</p><h2 id="samsung-is-still-planning-to-finally-include-qi2-magnets-2">Samsung is still planning to finally include Qi2 magnets</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4026px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-11" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus with a case on and an ESR Qi2 charger attached to the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4026" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android manufacturers are tweaking the designs of their smartphones to stay competitive as the Qi2 era finally begins. MagSafe has been standard on iPhones for half a decade, but the Qi2 equivalent only became mainstream on Android with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a>. Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-qi2-chargers-in-the-us">it's Samsung's turn to respond</a>, and it might be tweaking the Galaxy S26 design to accommodate internal magnets.</p><p>It's unclear what exactly led Samsung to allegedly change the Galaxy S26's design. It could be the inclusion of Qi2 magnets, or something else entirely. As Android Headlines notes, the updated prototype has a thicker camera bump, so it could have something to do with the camera modules themselves.</p><p>Either way, if these leaks pan out, the Galaxy S26 will add Qi2 magnets while only gaining 0.04mm of thickness compared to the Galaxy S25.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While I wasn't that keen on the design initially, it has proven to be easier to hold and use, and the weight distribution is ideal. What I'm particularly liking is the battery life, thanks to the huge 7,500mAh battery, the phone manages to last a day and a half even with heavy use.</p><p>It's the cameras that make the Find X9 Pro truly stand out. In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro review</a>, I noted that the new imaging engine combined with the camera sensors gave the phone a distinct advantage over its predecessors, and this was immediately noticeable when using the phone as my go-to camera in a visit to Mexico earlier this month.</p><p>OPPO invited me to attend Día de Muertos, an annual Mexican celebration where communities come together to honor the dead. The two-day celebration included parades and face painting, and was the backdrop to test the cameras of the Find X9 Pro — so let's get started.</p><h2 id="the-main-camera-is-fantastic-2">The main camera is fantastic</h2><p>The Find X9 Pro gets a new 50MP Sony LYT-828 imaging module as the main camera, and it is fabulous. It does a great job in daylight as well as challenging situations, delivering photos with good color vibrancy, dynamic range, and details.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

job tweaking the overall balance of the photos, and this is a definite plus point over the Find X8 Pro. This is evident in low-light shots, where the Find X9 Pro is able to deliver better colors than previous years.</p><h2 id="the-3x-zoom-lens-is-one-of-the-best-around-2">The 3x zoom lens is one of the best around</h2><p>The phone has a 2200MP Samsung HP5 3x module with OIS, and although there isn't a dedicated 6x lens, it wasn't an issue. The 3x lens takes detailed shots up to 10x, and I even got usable shots at 30x — albeit anything over 10x gets a sprinkling of AI.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

Now, the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/free-fire-league/" target="_blank">partnering</a> with the publisher of Free Fire to open up the Free Fire League, available now through Nov. 23. Free Fire has been downloaded over a billion times on Android, and Google is now giving you a chance to earn rewards for playing the popular survival shooter game.</p><p>The way leagues work with Google Play Games is simple. By participating and climbing the league leaderboard, gamers will earn Google Play Points. From there, those points can be exchanged for Google Play Credit, or to unlock special items in apps and games. In other words, you can play Free Fire for a limited time to earn credits to pay for your next mobile game on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Here's how Google explains the Free Fire League competition: "Compete against other people in the Play community. Play Free Fire, climb the leaderboard, and eliminate the most players in ranked mode to win."</p><p>The Free Fire League is open to everyone with a Google Play Games profile in select markets. There are 150 million Play Points up for grabs, and they'll be distributed based on your leaderboard standing. Every elimination in Free Fire counts, whether it's played on Android or PC (with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/googleplaygames/" target="_blank">Google Play Games on PC</a>).</p><p>You can view the leaderboard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://leagues.withgoogle.com/en/free-fire/" target="_blank">here</a>, with the top spot set to earn 5,000 Google Play Points in one go.</p><h2 id="what-you-can-do-with-earned-google-play-points-2">What you can do with earned Google Play Points</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DHfQ9qvWzTgt6iaAKHrKzj" name="Google-Play-Comic-Con-experience-9.jpg" alt="A Google Play sign on a Ferris wheel gondola" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DHfQ9qvWzTgt6iaAKHrKzj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android users can start climbing the leaderboard for a shot at Play Points by opening the Play Points home in the Google Play Store. From there, open the <strong>Perks</strong> tab and find the Free Fire League. When league play ends later this month, gamers will be able to grab their Play Points and exchange them for rewards.</p><p>Aside from in-game items and credits, gamers can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store/googles-play-points-teams-up-with-android-and-youtube-in-the-uk">climb Play Points levels</a> to get extra perks.

Users can expect this patch to arrive on their streaming devices "over the next few weeks." At the core of this update, Google says users can expect Gemini to completely replace its old Assistant (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">bye-bye, Assistant</a>). This is a part of Google's focus to introduce a more natural and conversational voice-powered AI experience, even for its TVs.</p><p>Through Gemini for TV, Google says users can help their kids with school-related topics and homework. If they're learning about natural phenomena, they can ask Gemini about "why volcanoes erupt." Moreover, users can even learn DIY projects with Gemini, as it leverages YouTube videos right on your TV.</p><p>Regarding entertainment, Gemini for TV is smarter than the Assistant, giving users the option of finding shows or movies that fit two different interests. Per Google's example, if you like dramas, but the person you're hanging out with likes comedies, you can tell Gemini about those tastes and see what it produces. Gemini's intelligence can also summarize what happened in the previous season of a show to get you up to speed for Season 2.</p><p>Google highlights its TV Streamer's remote microphone button as your premier gateway to Gemini on TV. As previously stated, this update is rolling out, but it will take a few weeks before all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-vs-chromecast-with-google-tv-4k">TV Streamers</a> see it.</p><h2 id="gemini-is-here-for-all-you-binge-watchers-2">Gemini is here for all you binge-watchers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vpbZNuAkjazePb5HNowsb7" name="google-tv-streamer-apps-page.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer Apps page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vpbZNuAkjazePb5HNowsb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've been waiting for this update for a little over a month, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/gemini-for-google-tv-launches-only-a-few-enjoy-smarter-entertainment">Google's original Gemini for TV announcement</a> left quite a few of us out.</p><p>After being teased during CES 2025, consumers knew to expect a major Gemini-focused TV update from Google. When it was finally announced late in September, we saw everything it had to offer. Not only were natural conversations possible with Gemini, but it can also summarize previous show seasons, merge entertainment interests, and help children learn new topics.</p><p>These same capabilities were announced for the Google TV Streamer; however, that original announcement only concerned TCL QM9K series devices in September.</p><p>All we were given was a "later this year" date for more devices, like the Google TV Streamer. It seems the time has finally arrived for the TV Streamer, but we're still waiting on a few more. Google states its Gemini for TV update is headed for Walmart Onn. 4K Pro, 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In unusual fashion, Samsung is opening up sales for certified refurbished versions of Galaxy S25 models while they are still current. The company's "Certified Re-Newed" program now includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. If you're looking for a foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is now part of the program, too.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/10/samsung-launches-re-newed-galaxy-s25-z-fold-6/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, listings for these models are now available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-s25-certified-re-newed-256gb-sku-sm5s931uzkexaa/" target="_blank">Samsung's Certified Re-Newed online storefront</a>. Buyers can grab certified refurbished versions of the phones at a slight discount. The Galaxy S25 series phones are discounted by between $150 and $260, depending on the model and storage configuration. The cheapest option is the 256-gigabyte variant of the base Galaxy S25, which costs $709.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is priced at just $1,429, and that's $370 lower than MSRP. Here's the full list of available Certified Re-Newed models:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-s25-certified-re-newed-256gb-sku-sm5s931uzkexaa/" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB) - $709</a></li><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-s25-plus-certified-re-newed-512gb-sku-sm5s936uzkexaa/" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus (512GB) - $899</a></li><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-certified-re-newed-256gb-sku-sm5s938uakaxaa/" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (256GB) - $1,109</a></li><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-certified-re-newed-512gb-sku-sm5s938uakexaa/" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (512GB) - $1,159</a></li><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-certified-re-newed-256gb-sku-sm5f956uakaxaa/" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 (256GB) - $1,429</a></li><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-certified-re-newed-512gb-sku-sm5f956uzsexaa/" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 - (512GB) - $1,479</a></li></ul><p>If the models above still look expensive despite the certified refurbished discount, that's because both the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus are only available in their higher storage tier. Additionally, the 1TB variant of the Galaxy S25 Ultra isn't available through the Certified Re-Newed program at the moment. Notably, there's only a $50 difference between the 256GB and 512GB variants of the refurbished Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>The availability of certified refurbished Galaxy S25 units comes ahead of schedule. We're used to seeing the Certified Re-Newed models drop after they're replaced by the next generation of flagship.

Samsung has officially opened its One UI 8 Watch beta program based on Wear OS 6 to the Galaxy Watch 5 and Watch 5 Pro.</p><p>The rollout began in South Korea, as per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EC%9B%A8%EC%96%B4%EB%9F%AC%EB%B8%94-%EC%9B%8C%EC%B9%98-%EB%B2%84%EC%A6%88-%EA%B8%B0%ED%83%80/%EC%9B%8C%EC%B9%985-%EC%93%B0%EC%8B%9C%EB%8A%94%EB%B6%84%EB%93%A4-%EB%B2%A0%ED%83%80%EA%B0%80-%EC%98%A4%ED%94%88%EB%90%98%EC%97%88%EB%84%A4%EC%9A%94/td-p/35750693" target="_blank">post</a> on Samsung Korea's community forum, while other markets, such as the U.S., are expected to follow in the near future (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-5-pro-one-ui-8-watch-beta-program/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). Eligible users can now sign up for early access to the beta version and test out new features before the stable release.</p><p>Samsung’s next major OS upgrade for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Galaxy Watch lineup</a> promises notable improvements, such as improved gesture controls that let users perform actions like answering calls or dismissing alarms. There’s also a new Now Bar, a persistent display element that provides real-time updates for ongoing activities right on the watch face.</p><p>You can also combine two tiles into one, so it’s now easier to check information at a glance. These updates build on features already tested on the Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic, which are currently on the fifth beta version of One UI 8 Watch.</p><h2 id="stable-update-still-limited-2">Stable update still limited</h2><p>Nonetheless, the stable version of One UI 8 Watch is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/wear-os-6-galaxy-watch-7">currently available only for the Galaxy Watch 7 series</a> and the new Watch Ultra. Meanwhile, users of older models like the Watch 5 and Watch 6 are still in beta territory for now.</p><p>Samsung said it would bring the stable update to older devices by the end of the year, but things have moved slowly. Still, expanding the beta program is a good sign that the final release is on the way.</p><p>For now, the beta is only available in South Korea, but U.S. users will probably get access soon. If you have a Galaxy Watch 5 and want to try it, you can sign up through the Samsung Members app by tapping the One UI 8 Watch beta banner, as long as you meet the region and device requirements.</p><p>As is always the case, beta software can have bugs, so it’s best for those who don’t mind a few issues in exchange for early access to new features.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Creative is now aiming to reboot the Sound Blaster series in a big way: meet the Sound Blaster Re:Imagine, a module sound card designed for the modern age.</p><p>To start with, this is much more than a regular sound card; Creative dubs it an audio hub to connect all your devices. If anything, the design and modularity looks like something made by teenage engineering, and I'm immediately interested in the product.</p><p>Creative sold over 400 million units of Sound Blaster cards over the decades, but for this product, it is taking the crowdfunding route. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/soundblaster/sound-blaster-re-imagine-modular-audio-hub-with-ai">Re:Imagine is now listed on Kickstarter</a>, and Creative says it is doing so to engage with its userbase to understand what they need out of a sound card. You'll need to shell out $349 to get your hands on the sound card, and as of writing, the project has $202,000 worth of pledges.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2HyRDfYvRPneGDadiRvsTf" name="Creative Sound Blaster Re:Imagine" alt="Creative Sound Blaster Re:Imagine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2HyRDfYvRPneGDadiRvsTf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creative)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Re:Imagine hub has an integrated 32-bit/384kHz DAC, and the amp drives headsets with 32Ω to 300Ω without any issues. It works with Windows, macOS, Linux, PS5, Switch, and all Android phones, and interestingly, you can run it in a standalone mode — it's powered by Linux, and comes with 8GB of RAM and 16GB of built-in storage and an SD card slot.</p><p>The key allure (for me at least) is the modularity, with the Re:Imagine featuring distinct modules: there's a rotary knob, mixer-style slider, buttons, and a 3-inch panel. The Horizon Cluster unit that Creative is selling includes a base unit alongside one of each module, with the modules attaching magnetically to the base unit. On that note, the base unit contains all the connectors, including 3.5mm out, line in/out, optical, USB-C audio in, and connecting to USB-C hosts.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NtaQXQsHGq5fAZmJYdn4Tf" name="Creative Sound Blaster Re:Imagine" alt="Creative Sound Blaster Re:Imagine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NtaQXQsHGq5fAZmJYdn4Tf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creative)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The buttons are programmable, so you can customize actions or assign macros when connected to Windows. Creative is bundling a suite of fun utilities that can be accessed via the 3-inch panel, including an AI-based music generator (obviously), music visualizers to truly make things nostalgic, and even a DOS emulator.</p><p>It all looks pretty great, and I can't wait to get my hands on the Sound Blaster Re:Imagine to see how it holds up in real-world use. Creative says it will start deliveries by mid-2026, and with retail prices set to be $500, you'll want to get in on the action if you like the look of the modular sound card.</p> ]]></dc:content>
