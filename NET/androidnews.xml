After sifting through a recent Play Services beta, AssembleDebug was able to (in a way) activate Google's version of Apple's contact sharing feature. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/Y2-LxVx62x0">tipster's video evidence</a> shows how this could work between devices, as they hold one phone atop the other.</p><p>There appears to be some distance between phones; however, an almost creamsicle-colored animation appears shortly after.</p><p>The lights appear along the top portion of both phones, rolling through their rounded corners and down the display partway. The animation will likely appear, alongside the contact information you've shared and received. The animation recedes to the punch hole selfie camera once the process is completed.</p><p>NFC still appears to play a major part in this contact exchange, but, as the tipster states, it's unclear just how reliant on it the feature will be. As development progresses, the tipster speculates that NFC could simply kickstart the feature before throwing things over to a user's Bluetooth or even Wi-Fi connectivity for the rest.</p><h2 id="one-tap-done-2">One tap, done</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="YQLqgV4NfDbEq5jfEF8vyG" name="android-apple-namedrop-like-feature-progress-leak" alt="Google's version of Apple's NameDrop leaked again, showcasing bright, cream-colored animation along the top portion of the phone during the sharing process." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YQLqgV4NfDbEq5jfEF8vyG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the second time Google's version of Apple's NameDrop has appeared in rumors. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-might-copy-apples-namedrop-to-make-contact-sharing-easier">first instance occurred in November</a> when early strings of Google's code reportedly alluded to its existence. The code called the feature a "Gesture Exchange," while other important code bits highlighted its reliance on NFC. It's been speculated that, much like Apple, Google's version would let users share their phone number, photo, name, and email.</p><p>That earlier discovery even leverage a small menu, which could greet users before sharing information.</p><p>Users may find a checklist of details they'd like to share before "tapping" their phone on somdone else's to begin the transfer.

The post alleges some details about the tracker's upgrades, stating the Moto Tag 2 could boast a stronger, longer-lasting battery than its first iteration. Moreover, the company could equip the next tracker with increased location precision, alongside "better button tactility."</p><p>Ultrawide band connectivity (UWB), IP67 dust and water protection are rumored for the next tracker. The publication reportedly obtained the alleged promotional material for the Moto Tag 2, showing off its updated design.</p><p>Per the image, the Moto Tag 2 is seemingly preparing to arrive in two colors: a peach option and an almost cream-colored version, too. Additionally, the rendering suggests the main body of the tracker could remain the same. The render shows a raised portion on the tracker's button (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/moto-tag-bluetooth-tracker-launch">like the first model</a>). The image then highlights a punch hole at the top.</p><p>What's unclear about this is whether it's a loophole for a string to slide through or, perhaps, a more pronounced tiny speaker.</p><h2 id="tagged-but-with-a-2-2">Tagged, but with a 2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:471px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:127.39%;"><img id="KidnNEoifJMNKUmJHWDryH" name="motorola-moto-tag-2-alleged-render" alt="An alleged rendering of the Moto Tag 2 from Motorola, which retains a similar design to the first iteration with a raised portion for its physical button." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KidnNEoifJMNKUmJHWDryH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="471" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There was a lot of interest around Motorola's first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/moto-tag-bluetooth-tracker-launch">Bluetooth tracker when it launched</a> in the summer of 2024. The company sought to make a bold statement in a market <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">with multiple options</a>. The original launched with a small and sleek design, which we're expecting Motorola to continue with the second generation, if the rumors are to be believed. Motorola launched its Tag with full <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-find-hub-app-redesign-rolling-out">Find My Device network</a> compatibility, meaning Android users anywhere could utilize its capabilities.</p><p>The Tag's battery is estimated to last users a whole year before needing a replacement.

The phone's alleged renders make it look similar to its 2025 counterpart, though it might swap its glass back for an "eco-leather" material. The same mid-range RAM/storage options are suspected, but there could be more in store for its battery capacity. The publication claims that this Moto Tag 2 might even debut with the G Stylus in 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Kicking off the phone's reveal is the "Made Together" campaign, which Nothing states, "celebrates the design process and collaboration within the Nothing community." The design language of this campaign represents "making tech fun to inspire human creativity." It credits campaign winner, Sushruta Sarkar, for taking charge here.</p><p>According to Nothing, the winning design for the Phone 3a goes to one of its campaign creators, Emre Kayganacl. This was "stage one" in the development process, as Kayganacl spearheaded the Phone 3a's new aesthetic with a "late 90s and early 2000s technology" theme. The Phone 3a's Community Edition takes on this light blue color, which Nothing says reminds it of old game toys (think Game Boy).</p><p>Joining the Phone 3a is an accessory: dice. Nothing states that while dice typically represent chance in gaming and more, it paired this Phone 3a'a accessory with dice that feature its Ndot 55 font. Ambrogio Tacconi and Louis Aymond took charge of this particular development aspect.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EMYoXTO4mHI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The final aspect of the Phone 3a, bringing it all home, is its lock screen and wallpaper design. Nothing states the device's new design, led by Jad Zock, "reduces visual clutter and guides the eye intuitively to the key components." The company also states that consumers interested in the phone will find that the design still ensures users get all the information they need quickly without forgetting.</p><p>Nothing credits Jad Zock's design as one that seamlessly merges the rear design with its digital aesthetic. Users will find four versions of this wallpaper available (two blue, two purple) as well as a few easter eggs.</p><h2 id="the-community-edition-is-here-2">The Community Edition is here</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="RohXyfpWxeynJHJY8NUUSQ" name="nothing-phone3a-community-edition-dice-accessory" alt="The Nothing's Phone 3a Community Edition is paired with an accessory: dice, which features the company's classic font for the numbers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RohXyfpWxeynJHJY8NUUSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="MSmGo2mvDpmDfy2obmJnRQ" name="nothing-phone3a-community-edition-wallpaper" alt="Nothing's Phone 3a Community Edition wallpaper blends its rear design with its digital screen seamlessly for a retro aesthetic." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MSmGo2mvDpmDfy2obmJnRQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As stated previously, Nothing is only creating 1,000 Phone 3a Community Editions for consumers in a 12/256GB variant.

Starting at $299, the beginner-friendly VR headset also boasts upgraded hand tracking and low light tracking capabilities, next-gen controllers, and complete access to the same library of games as the more-expensive Meta Quest 3. Furthermore, the device is powered by the cutting-edge Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor and comes with 8GB of RAM straight out of the box.</p><p>Sure, if you directly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">compare the Meta Quest 3S with the standard Quest 3</a>, you'll notice that the more affordable model has a lower-res display and narrower field-of-view than its premium counterpart, but you're also paying at least $200 less for it. In other words, if you're trying to get into VR gaming for the first time, the Meta Quest 3S is the best way to do it for cheap, <em>especially</em> when you slap on a $50 no-strings discount from Walmart.</p><h2 id="holiday-deals-2025-quick-links-2">Holiday deals 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>major discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Android Central's Senior Editor, Nicholas Sutrich, got a package from Motorola earlier this week, and the box had an invite to its CES display, plus a wooden flip book that opens and folds into a lamp, with a dim red light.</p><p>According to Sutrich, the lamp features a magnetic clasp that keeps it fully open and folded backward. This package did give us a peek into what Motorola could have in store at CES, a possible new flagship device that could look a lot like a book-style foldable, much like the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="au6raWoy5ELxshCh8gdan" name="Moto-fold-CES" alt="Motorola could be teasing its next Moto Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/au6raWoy5ELxshCh8gdan.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now hear us out, there were several clues within the package that just screamed that this new form factor could be in the works. The most obvious indication is within the invite itself, which states, "We're getting ready to unfold a new perspective at Lenovo Tech World, set to take place on January 6." The emphasis on "unfold" caught our attention, given that Motorola's current foldable phones are all Flip devices.</p><p>The mysterious device also might feature a wooden finish, suggested by the wooden cover of the foldable lamp. It also has the Motorola "M" logo engraved on it, with the line "every fold reveals a possibility."</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="s3JF9Xj7weJ4WeAZDZDyo" name="Moto-fold-CES" alt="Motorola could be teasing its next Moto Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s3JF9Xj7weJ4WeAZDZDyo.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="upYsuGLtYu6ib9apVtYqn" name="Moto-fold-CES" alt="Motorola could be teasing its next Moto Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/upYsuGLtYu6ib9apVtYqn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HKfLwP689ohPYQrdz7QotY" name="motorola-ces-2026-fold-teaser-01" alt="Motorola sent us a teaser package that screams something exciting is brewing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HKfLwP689ohPYQrdz7QotY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Considering, Motorola is the only company that likes to experiment with unique materials such as bamboo, teak, ebony, and walnut wood in its smartphone designs, since the <em>Moto X</em> days (starting around 2013-2014), where the company allowed users to fully customize their devices. And more recently, with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/what-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-color-should-you-buy">Motorola Razr 2025,  Mountain Trail edition</a>, which featured thin wood inlay.</p><p>The lamp's mechanism is such that it unfolds end-to-end, with its pages illuminated in a red hue; however, it remains unclear whether the foldable device will operate just like the lamp, which only time will tell.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>The Pixel 10 wasn’t known for its raw performance at launch. If you bought one, you likely did it for the cameras or the AI smarts, not because the Tensor G5 would beat the Snapdragon 8 Elite in speed tests. But the Pixel 10 is apparently getting faster, not from new hardware, but thanks to some quiet software changes.</p><p>The latest round of updates, including the December Android 16 QPR2 release, is apparently giving the Pixel 10 a noticeable boost in day-to-day responsiveness, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-qpr2-performance-test-3622602/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>It’s an interesting twist for a phone that launched with promising hardware but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">caught early criticism for GPU performance</a> that lagged behind Snapdragon-powered rivals. Now, Google seems to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-promises-gpu-improvements-pixel-10">clawing back some of that ground with pure software optimization</a>, and some folks on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1pdyykp/something_has_changed_pixel_10_gpu_performance/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> seem to have noticed it too.</p><h2 id="more-than-a-tune-up-2">More than a tune-up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5035px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KXqaiSix2JfjJLxiU6WLx9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KXqaiSix2JfjJLxiU6WLx9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5035" height="2836" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android 16’s QPR2 update might not seem major at first, but it does more than just change the look of the interface. Early tests show that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> with QPR2 gets about a 5% boost in both multi-core CPU and peak GPU scores.</p><p>The real surprise is in everyday use: PCMark Work 3.0 scores went up by nearly 20%, which suggests Google improved task scheduling in ways users will notice.</p><p>The changes aren’t dramatic, and the Pixel 10 still isn’t built for gaming, but the phone does feel smoother, according to the report. Performance isn’t the only improvement, though. QPR2 also adds system-wide refinements like customizable launcher icon shapes, a better widget panel, improved HDR brightness control, and many fixes for battery, Bluetooth, camera, and display issues.</p><p>This December patch bundles in over 30 security and bug fixes, tightening up the software foundation the Pixel 10 runs on.</p><p>The bigger takeaway is what this means for Google’s update strategy. Rather than waiting for yearly Android releases to boost performance, Google is now adding real improvements in quarterly updates. If this continues, the Pixel line could hold up much better over time than the first-generation Tensor devices did.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ithome.com/0/902/631.htm" target="_blank">new report</a> from China suggests the company is quietly tightening its regional strategy and pulling back from a global rollout of its in-house chip (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_now_said_to_be_using_the_exynos_2600_in_the_galaxy_s26_series_in_just_one_market-news-70592.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>This change probably has to do with how the Exynos 2600 is performing in development. The chip should use Samsung’s improved 3nm GAP process, with a custom CPU and a new Xclipse GPU made with AMD. Samsung hopes this mix will finally deliver better thermal stability, stronger on-device AI, and improved power management.</p><p>But none of those improvements may reach buyers outside Samsung’s home market. Instead, only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> and S26 Plus in Korea are expected to be Exynos-powered, while global variants switch entirely to Qualcomm’s upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5.</p><h2 id="competition-could-have-forced-samsung-s-hand-2">Competition could have forced Samsung's hand?</h2><p>The reasoning behind this pivot is unclear, but it’s not hard to guess. The company has been working to restore trust in its Exynos chips after past issues with battery life and heat. By limiting the Exynos 2600 to Korea, Samsung can test its progress at home without risking more criticism from global users.</p><p>Competition may be another factor. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, with its new Oryon CPU, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-benchmarks-reveal-qualcomms-dominance-yet-again">is a big upgrade</a>. Using Snapdragon worldwide could help Samsung keep performance steady across all S26 models, especially in benchmarks and heat management, which are crucial in the high-end market.</p><p>If the report is accurate, the Galaxy S26 will launch with two different chips again. Korean customers will get Samsung’s latest Exynos, while everyone else will see Qualcomm’s flagship. Still, it’s rare for Samsung to limit Exynos to just one country, since it usually sells Exynos phones worldwide, especially in Europe. So, the final decision on this strategy is still up in the air.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But as the browser becomes more like a personal assistant, Google is working hard to prevent security problems. After all, assistants can be fooled, and that risk is at the heart of Google’s new security changes.</p><p>When Gemini <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-in-chrome-browsing-with-ai-assisted-answers-security-more-announced">first landed in Chrome for U.S. desktop users back in September</a>, it marked the beginning of “agentic browsing,” Google’s term for letting AI take meaningful actions online. Instead of simply responding to prompts, the browser could actually carry out a workflow across pages and tabs.</p><p>However, allowing AI to click buttons and read websites for you is exactly what security experts have warned about. Some malicious sites can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/turns-out-gmails-ai-email-summaries-arent-as-secure-as-we-thought">hide secret instructions in their code or page elements</a>, a method called indirect prompt injection, and use it to control the AI without you knowing.</p><p>To address this, Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/12/architecting-security-for-agentic.html" target="_blank">adding a new safety feature</a> called the user alignment critic, which acts like a built-in gatekeeper for Gemini’s proposed actions. Before the AI executes anything, the action is routed to this model. Instead of reading the webpage directly, the Critic only receives structured metadata that describes what the action will do.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.78%;"><img id="wstVSYroo5GrQtpKDDHdLE" name="Chrome-user-alignment-critic" alt="A flow chart that depicts the User Alignment Critic: a trusted component that vets each action before it reaches the browser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wstVSYroo5GrQtpKDDHdLE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1269" height="619" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="action-must-match-intent-2">Action must match intent</h2><p>Isolating the Critic from raw web content prevents a hostile site from manipulating the safety system itself. If an action doesn’t match your stated intent, the Critic blocks it outright. This extra layer in Chrome helps keep the AI working as intended, even if some websites try to interfere.</p><p>This new architecture also expands Chrome’s origin isolation rules so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> can only interact with the specific domains involved in your task. It can’t wander off to unrelated sites or make unexpected network requests.</p><p>Alongside that, Google has layered in threat detection tools, user confirmations for sensitive operations, and aggressive red-teaming before new agentic features roll out. Each piece is meant to reinforce the others, creating a defense-in-depth model that treats AI decision-making as a high-risk environment rather than a novelty feature.</p><p>Google is also putting money on the table to prove it works. The company has updated its Vulnerability Rewards Program, offering up to $20,000 to any researcher who can bypass these new agentic security layers.</p><p>The upgrades arrive as Chrome prepares to ship more agentic capabilities, which means users will soon see Gemini taking more initiative online.</p> ]]></dc:content>

OnePlus went backward on ergonomics with this release and even replaced the trademark OnePlus Alert slider with a generic AI button. Yuck.</p><p>Thankfully, Thinborne's minimalist case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G29X3667">is finally available at Amazon</a> and solves several problems that I have with the design. First off, it's a minimalist aramid fiber case, which means its primary function is to provide scratch resistance and add grip to an otherwise slippery phone.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> isn't slippery by any means — the Micro-Arc Oxidation metal frame has a semi-rough ceramic-like feel — but the boxy nature means it's less comfortable to hold and harder to pick up from a table. This case almost completely fixes that, as the aramid fiber material is more tactile and is just easier to grip and hold, plus the slightly rounded edges make the phone feel more natural in my hands.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> is still the only major Android phone series with MagSafe built in, and while that's certainly annoying for other brands, at least a minimalist case solves the problem.</p><p>Now, if you've never used a minimalist case before, know that these are <em>not</em> made for dropping. While the IP65/68/69/69K/ABCZYX ingress protection on the OnePlus 15 will protect against all sorts of crazy situations, it won't keep your screen from cracking if it falls down a flight of stairs.</p><p>Now that the display is fully flat — one of the <em>only</em> good design changes this time around — tempered glass protectors work perfectly on the phone and will keep your screen from breaking in most situations. The case also comes with a tempered glass screen protector in the box, but you can always grab some backup <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-oneplus-15-screen-protectors">OnePlus 15 screen protectors.</a>  So grab that case, slap on a screen protector, and enjoy a better OnePlus 15 experience for years to come.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f8458d5c-fd17-46aa-90e2-95dd5dc2109a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Add grip, style, and MagSafe compatibility to your OnePlus 15 with Thinborne's minimalist aramid fiber case, from my favorite minimalist case brand." data-dimension48="Add grip, style, and MagSafe compatibility to your OnePlus 15 with Thinborne's minimalist aramid fiber case, from my favorite minimalist case brand." data-dimension25="$69.69" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G29X3667" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1167px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:119.02%;"><img id="2NWTPWLfv5QNHrQa3PB5EB" name="thinborne-oneplus-15-case-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2NWTPWLfv5QNHrQa3PB5EB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1167" height="1389" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Add grip, style, and MagSafe compatibility to your OnePlus 15 with Thinborne's minimalist aramid fiber case, from my favorite minimalist case brand.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G29X3667" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f8458d5c-fd17-46aa-90e2-95dd5dc2109a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Add grip, style, and MagSafe compatibility to your OnePlus 15 with Thinborne's minimalist aramid fiber case, from my favorite minimalist case brand." data-dimension48="Add grip, style, and MagSafe compatibility to your OnePlus 15 with Thinborne's minimalist aramid fiber case, from my favorite minimalist case brand." data-dimension25="$69.69">View Deal</a></p></div> ]]></dc:content>

It felt like the perfect gameplay adaptation of one of my favorite TV shows, and it helped that I could tag along with friends and beat the heck out of the bad guys plaguing NYC.</p><p>Fast forward several decades, and now I'm actually embodying those same Ninja Turtles in a new VR game for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://vr.meta.me/s/1L2KRVYie9Nqfgj" target="_blank">Meta Quest</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bit.ly/3ZbZwLR" target="_blank">Steam VR,</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bit.ly/4ov46OM" target="_blank">Pico</a> headsets. You can wishlist the game via those links, which is scheduled to come out sometime early in 2026. TMNT: Empire City has been teased since August, and now we finally have the gameplay to understand what you'll be doing in the game.</p><p>In a nutshell (halfshell?), this one's a near-perfect translation of the classic 2D gameplay into a 3D space, giving you full autonomy over your Turtle of choice via freedom of movement offered by a VR headset. Slicing Footclan members with Leo's swords, smacking them on the head with Michaelangelo's nunchucks, wacking them with Donatello's staff, or stabbing them with Raphael's Sai felt as authentic as a comic book come to life could be. It was cathartic in every way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

The storyline in this portion of the game involves all four turtles "gaining ingress" into a building, as Leonardo so eloquently put it, only to have three of them get captured by a heinous villain who works for The Shredder.</p><p>The Turtles apparently think the Footclan and Shredder were supposed to be defeated, but it turns out some dark art is keeping Shredder and his minions from properly entering the afterlife. That's where the turtles come in, although the demo cuts off right as the boss's plans are thwarted.</p><p>You play as each turtle in the tutorial, learning movement tricks, how each weapon works, and how to utterly kick the butts of every Footclan member you come across. You'll climb pipes and walls, jump higher than any human could, and unleash kicks and a fury of weaponry that make you feel exactly like the arcade beat-em-up, just translated into 3D movement.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span

sewers of NYC. All the classic moves are here, including the flying jump kick that sees you hopping into the air and pressing the dash button to unleash a devastating thwack to the bad guys.</p><p>The remaining 10 minutes or so of the demo was spent in the Turtle's lair, which acts as the central hub for this pseudo-open-world game. The lair is unmistakable in its design, meticulously crafted and fun to roam around. You can check out all four Turtle's rooms, chat with Master Splinter, plan the next mission with April O'Neal, and head upstairs to craft unlockables throughout your adventures.</p><p>While none of the levels were open for this demo, heading out into the sewers takes you to different parts of the city for butt-kicking mayhem. Based on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOJ7vMJxHGY">previous parkour video</a>, it looks like a notable amount of space is traversable, with climbable buildings and fun parkour everywhere. I'm super stoked to play this one with friends and couldn't be more excited to finally get the chance to embody a Ninja Turtle next year!</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung first introduced its pinching shortcut on Galaxy Watches with Wear OS 5, while Apple Watches also have a Double Tap shortcut.</p><p>Google seemed to acknowledge this in the press release, noting that "unique to Pixel Watch" will be "helpful context hints right on screen" for when to use the gesture. When you look at an incoming phone call, for example, the green phone button will temporarily switch to an animated pinch gesture.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2088px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mPAXtZxUhTkgdRaaVfKPcN" name="Pixel-Watch-4-double-pinch-answer-call" alt="A render of the Pixel Watch 4 showing an incoming phone call screen, with the green Answer button showing a Double Pinch gesture animation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mPAXtZxUhTkgdRaaVfKPcN.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2088" height="1175" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="Jbsn5sTFtVJHwRbYHW2BJj" name="Pixel-Watch-4-wrist-turn" alt="A screenshot of the Pixel Watch 4 showing a guide for using the the Wrist Turn one-handed gesture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jbsn5sTFtVJHwRbYHW2BJj.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2256" height="1504" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Bw5PuKrSSJzU7MvfSrsMF6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-knock-knock-gesture" alt="The Knock Knock gesture screen on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, worn on the wrist of someone doing the gesture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bw5PuKrSSJzU7MvfSrsMF6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Knock Knock gesture on the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The second new Pixel Watch 4 gesture is Wrist Turn, which silences notifications or incoming calls; this, too, is similar to Samsung's "Shake" gesture and functionality.

The company already has a good track record with its foldables, particularly the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, and it appears Samsung is taking what it's learned to deliver an impressively thin phone with impressive specs.</p><p>It measures only 3.9mm at its thinnest point and 12.9mm when folded, making it less than a millimeter thicker than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and slightly thicker than its closest competitor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts">Huawei Mate XTs</a>. It features a 6.5-inch AMOLED cover screen, but flip it around, and it opens to a 10-inch display that looks like a small tablet.</p><p>In fact, while other large-screen foldables are often compared to tablets, this may be the closest thing to one given the wide, rectangular aspect ratio. This should improve the video-watching experience and possibly gaming, too, as there will likely be little or no letterboxing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oJ9KbyNPX4yYyftLXhSvF8" name="Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="Galaxy Z TriFold unveiled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oJ9KbyNPX4yYyftLXhSvF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Otherwise, the phone is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> (not the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">8 Elite Gen 5</a>) and 16GB of RAM, which should prove more than enough for most people.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>AI products are often only as good as the prompts a user provides, and crafting the perfect prompt isn't an exact science. It's rare that we hear about what makes a successful AI prompt from an expert on the subject, but Google DeepMind UX Engineer Anna Bortsova is pulling back the curtain in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/meta-prompting-veo-gemini-tips/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. Bortsova, whose background is in visual arts and engineering, use a little-known technique called meta prompting to create videos with Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-steps-up-its-creativity-in-3-1-version-update-for-realism">Veo 3 video-generation model</a>.</p><p>Bortsova doesn't create her own prompts at all — she uses meta prompting to refine prompts with Gemini that are inputted to Flow or the Gemini app, which use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/openai-sora-video-generator-vs-google-veo-3">Veo 3</a>. Instead of writing a detailed video-generation prompt, Bortsova writes a prompt for Gemini.</p><p>Then, Gemini creates detailed video-generation prompts in bulk. By using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, the video-generation prompts used with Veo can be much longer than one a human would create. They can be "multiple pages" and are occasionally generated five to ten at a time, according to Bortsova.</p><p>Here's an example of how the DeepMind engineer creates gen-AI prompts with meta prompting in Gemini:</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.40%;"><img id="uyzeS5kZvd66AMnYkopjT4" name="Google-Meta-Prompting" alt="A meta prompting example from Google for Gemini and Veo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uyzeS5kZvd66AMnYkopjT4.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="664" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bortsova says there are "no rules" when it comes to meta prompting, but there are keys to success.</p><div><blockquote><p>You want to define a very specific task: ‘write a detailed prompt that an LLM will understand.’ And you want to be clear about your format and style: say, an 8-second stop-motion animation of paper-engineered scenes. Then give it constraints, like foil paper or shiny paper, rather than just general paper. Then let it do its thing.</p><p>Anna Bortsova, Google DeepMind UX Engineer</p></blockquote></div><p>After the initial prompt, users may want to steer Gemini in the right direction with follow-ups. The best exchanges with Gemini are collaborative, and are back-and-forth in nature. Bortsova also recommends getting emotional in your prompts by suggesting "the feeling you want to evoke."</p><p>Meta prompting is a technique that can be used in a variety of applications beyond video generation. Any time you want to achieve something with AI, it's a good idea to simply ask an AI model how to achieve it. Instead of painstakingly brainstorming the perfect prompt, use meta prompting. Ask Gemini for help creating the prompt that will eventually be re-inputted into the chatbot to complete the task at hand.</p><p>The one tip Bortsova thinks everyone should know? "Pick a subject you love and just start experimenting."</p> ]]></dc:content>

For a long time, if you wanted to keep a photo private, you had to move it to the Secure Folder. The Secure Folder is great for protecting banking apps and important documents, but using it just to hide a few pictures feels unnecessary. You have to unlock a separate, secure area, move the file, and if you want to edit or share it later, you have to move it back to the main gallery.</p><p>Thankfully, that friction might finally be disappearing. With the upcoming One UI 8.5 beta, Samsung is introducing a native "Private album" feature directly inside the Gallery app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-one-ui-8-5-private-album-feature-explained/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> reports.</p><h2 id="google-photos-style-security-2">Google Photos-style security</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.24%;"><img id="Wu66RbscoKDJfxkq58q6kR" name="Samsung-Gallery-private-album" alt="An option to move a picture to the private album in Samsung Gallery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wu66RbscoKDJfxkq58q6kR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1387" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SamMobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This feature blends the security you need with the convenience you’ve been missing, and it looks a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-and-use-locked-folder-google-photos">"Locked Folder" trick</a> Google Photos users have enjoyed for a while. Instead of migrating files to a completely different partition of your phone, you simply open an image or video, tap the "More" menu, and hit "Move to private album." You can even select multiple items and toss them in at once.</p><p>To view these hidden files, you just head to the Gallery’s menu and tap "Private Album." It is protected by your fingerprint or screen lock, so your secrets stay safe even if you hand your unlocked phone to a friend to swipe through vacation pics. Plus, Samsung disables screenshots inside the album.</p><p>But keep in mind, this is still a beta feature and is pretty basic for now. For example, you can only sort files by date and can’t rearrange them. The options are limited too — you can share, delete, or move files back to the main gallery, but that’s about it.</p><p>Since this is currently spotted in the One UI 8.5 beta, you will likely need to wait for the official rollout to see it on your device. Either way, this is the feature Samsung Gallery needed to truly compete with Google Photos on usability.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If anything, it's an achievement that devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/i-took-the-find-x9-pro-to-mexico-its-cameras-are-on-another-level-entirely">Find X9 Pro</a> managed to be just 8.3mm even with a massive 7,500mAh battery.</p><p>Infinix is doing its part with the Hot 60 Pro+; the phone isn't new, having made its debut in August, but it stands out for being an entry-level phone with a thickness of just 6mm. Of course, that nets it the moniker of the thinnest budget phone, and it isn't like the device is hobbled with a small battery — it still gets a 5,160mAh battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5055px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="8HnbeCUxGQ8iGaB53Umw3f" name="Infinix Hot 60 Pro+" alt="Infinix Hot 60 Pro Plus on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8HnbeCUxGQ8iGaB53Umw3f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5055" height="2847" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If anything, Infinix did a great job with the design of the Hot 60 Pro+. The phone gets a polycarbonate mid-frame and a fiberglass rear, and it's even available in eco leather. The vibrant colors and etched lines give it a decent amount of character, and I like the yellow hue of my unit — it reminds me of POCO's devices.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7JbEmW3bZAWyRZcPmtg6ue" name="Infinix Hot 60 Pro+" alt="Infinix Hot 60 Pro Plus on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7JbEmW3bZAWyRZcPmtg6ue.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="RqV7KoxU329bKcJE7ptote" name="Infinix Hot 60 Pro+" alt="Infinix Hot 60 Pro Plus on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RqV7KoxU329bKcJE7ptote.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4851px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="MFQseidN4GYLLYbcniQXqe" name="Infinix Hot 60 Pro+" alt="Infinix Hot 60 Pro Plus on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MFQseidN4GYLLYbcniQXqe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4851" height="2732" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CDSdoqf5pe92Xo7WEPXite" name="Infinix Hot 60 Pro+" alt="Infinix Hot 60 Pro Plus on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CDSdoqf5pe92Xo7WEPXite.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Another way the Hot 60 Pro+ stands out is the profile; the phone has dual-curved sides, and that's just not something you see these days.

It has a 6.78-inch 144Hz AMOLED panel, and the MediaTek Helio G200 is decent. It's running ancient Cortex A76 cores, so you will see noticeable lag even in mundane tasks, and it is strictly designed for casual gaming — it doesn't handle any demanding games.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="85Ddp9PfnzviyYdAzSwH4f" name="Infinix Hot 60 Pro+" alt="Infinix Hot 60 Pro Plus on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/85Ddp9PfnzviyYdAzSwH4f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 50MP camera is strictly average as well, and I don't know when was the last time I used a phone that didn't have Wi-Fi 6 — the Hot 60 Pro+ is limited to Wi-Fi ac. Look, this thing won't win any awards, but it is a sleek phone, and it is pretty durable thanks to IP65 ingress protection. The battery life is quite good, and the panel gets bright enough in outdoor use. Considering it costs $200, the Hot 60 Pro+ is a decent enough device, with a design that rivals phones priced thrice as high.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the update adds a number of features to the new flagship lineup, including auto-themed icons and AI-powered notification summaries, it also seems to have killed support for the Pixel Stand wireless charger.</p><p>Google debuted the Pixel 10 series as the first flagship Android phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 wireless charging support</a>. Alongside native Qi2 charging, Google also launched its own lineup of Qi2 accessories called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>, which includes a new wireless charger and stand designed for the Pixel 10.</p><p>Naturally, Google ended support for the older Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) for the Pixel 10, considering the company needed to push its new wireless chargers and the fact that the second-gen Pixel Stand topped out at 7.5W, leading to slow charging speeds and overheating, while the new Pixelsnap chargers deliver up to 25W.</p><h2 id="pixel-10-update-quietly-breaks-pixel-stand-support-2">Pixel 10 update quietly breaks Pixel Stand support</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PRv6WTunoou5USHMbLdwZa" name="google-pixel-10-Pro-XL-pixelsnap-charger-02" alt="Qi2 25W charging using a Pixelsnap charger on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PRv6WTunoou5USHMbLdwZa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, many users found that at the perfect angle, the Pixel Stand still worked with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a>. But now, users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1pe68ty/pixel_stand_gen_2_not_working_after_update/">Reddit</a> are reporting that after the Android 16 QPR2 update, the Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) no longer works with their devices.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/12/08/pixel-stand-charging-broken-for-pixel-10-10-pro-after-december-update/">PiunikaWeb</a>, users say that after the update, the Pixel Stand flashes orange and white whenever a Pixel 10 is placed on it. This wasn't the case earlier, but the charger now reportedly throws an error when attempting to charge. This means that Google has intentionally broken support for Pixel Stand in the latest Android update.</p><p>It's worth noting that the issue is limited to Pixel 10 series devices, and Google has always stated that the Pixel Stand doesn't officially support the Pixel 10. It worked until now, but the latest update seems to have introduced a change that breaks compatibility.</p><p>If you're looking for a new wireless charger, you might want to pick up one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">new Qi2 wireless chargers</a> to make sure your device charges at maximum speed without any issues.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Fossil, one of the biggest Wear OS brands before Samsung, lagged a year behind when it released Wear OS 3.5 in 2023, then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-group-quits-making-smartwatches">abandoned smartwatches</a> entirely a few months later. It offered another year of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-wear-os-gen-6-watch-november-2024-update">small updates</a> before fully abandoning the brand.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1189px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZakdJG7CAUoUCGnWqeHjsc" name="Mobvoi-TicNote-AI-gadget" alt="A press photo of a woman sliding a Mobvoi TicNote recorder into her shirt pocket." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZakdJG7CAUoUCGnWqeHjsc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1189" height="669" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mobvoi)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Right now, OnePlus is our favorite Wear OS alternative, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> offering impressive battery life and fast Wear OS 5 performance. But its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, is months overdue to receive its promised Wear OS 5 update.

According to the study, the earlier a kid owns a smartphone, the greater the risk they have of adverse effects on their sleep, emotional state, and health.</p><p>We had several options, ranging from ages 5-7 to age 14 and older. Somewhat surprisingly, of the hundreds of responses we received, most were from older ages. In fact, <strong>ages 14 and up</strong> was the most popular response with 53% of the votes, followed by ages 11-13 with 36% of the votes, ages 8-10 with 10% of the votes, and ages 5-7 with the remaining votes.</p><div style="min-height: 250px;">                                <div class="kwizly-quiz kwizly-WlkAve"></div>                            </div>                            <script src="https://kwizly.com/embed/WlkAve.js" async></script><p>Enjoy our content?

This would fall somewhere in the 10 to 14 age range, and is considered, to many, an important time for kids, socially. With the advent of after-school programs, social activities, and a growing need for independence as they navigate their pre-teen years, having an easier way to contact your child and keep track of their whereabouts may become a necessity for some parents.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think 13/14 is a good age for kids knowing how to act online and 16 for all other cases<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1996827061319880945">December 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We gave our granddaughter one when she stated middle school.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1997734976037806385">December 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>However, some were not as open to smartphone use for younger children, especially as the cost of owning one continues to go up and phones become more expensive.

Google denies such claims.</p><p>This afternoon, Marvin posted on Google's official Ads Liaison X account, stating that, "In short, there are no ads in the Gemini app, and there are no current plans to change that." Marvin reiterates the company's work to place ads in AI Overviews, a feature that is meant to be "helpful" to users, as it should only display products "relevant" to your query. The social media post states that U.S. users have this available in AI Overviews; however, there are plans to expand this to more (English-speaking) regions.</p><p>The original story can be read below.</p><p>A recent development in the AI chatbot space reports that Google is preparing to slip even more ads into an app that Android users may lean on.</p><p>Word broke on X via a post by Walter Bloomberg (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DeItaone/status/1998077960964768244">DeItaone</a>), which states that Google is seeking to bring ads to its AI chatbot, Gemini. The social media post states that the company has "told advertisers" that it will bring ads to Gemini in 2026. What's unclear here is whether or not these ads would appear on the mobile app alongside the web app, though it's hard to imagine one without the other.</p><p>More importantly, the report doesn't state in what capacity users could see ads appear in Gemini next year.</p><p>The Gemini app is currently quite clean, offering an easy-to-use chatting space with the AI, as well as a sidebar with additional options on the left. There's a chance ads could appear within chats themselves, potentially as a footnote, or in that sidebar for more "creative" ad space. Aside from the theories, the X post adds that this report was the result of "agency buyers familiar with the conversations," according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.adweek.com/media/google-gemini-ads-2026/">Ad Week</a> (paywalled), which published the exclusive.</p><p>The publication adds that, in a few calls with advertisers, Google has expressed its intent to roll out "ad placements" in Gemini next year. Supposedly, this new venture for Google for ads in Gemini is separate from what it's trying to do with AI Mode, though the details are still being hashed out.</p><h2 id="entering-another-new-era-2">Entering (another) new era</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb" name="Google-Gemini-app-home-page.JPG" alt="The Google Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QUuejB6p5fokJUFyse3swb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1910" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google and ads seem like familiar territory for many users, especially those targeted by their recent searches. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-ads-announced">announced that it would bring ads</a> to its bite-sized search results, AI Overviews, in 2024. During that time, Google said that it would only display ads if they were "relevant" to what the user had searched. If you're looking to compare cleaning products, it's likely you'll see ads for those same brands the AI compared for you.</p><p>We're entering an interesting juncture, as Google, at the time, stated that ads in AI Overviews were "helpful." This was a statement facilitated by user studies and tests where the company offered ads depending on the search and AI results. Perhaps these ads are more "helpful" or "accepted" in a web or search form, but to see them in Gemini, a chatbot and chatting space, might be a different story.</p><p>Regardless, this is seemingly the future we're staring at.</p><p>This report, highlighted by Walter Bloomberg on X, comes a few days after rumors claimed that OpenAI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/signs-in-chatgpts-code-suggest-android-users-are-in-for-an-influx-of-ads">was looking at rolling out ads in ChatGPT</a>. This would affect its mobile app experience, and it seems that ChatGPT could show ads based on its "memory," essentially, what it remembers about the user through their ads and frequent asks.</p> ]]></dc:content>

At first glance, the proposed renderings claim that next year's stylus will look similar to Motorola's design from 2025, as well as a few of its other phones this year. The phone's rear panel hosts a square (rounded corner) camera array in the top left corner. Its corners, around its frame, remain quite soft, rounded for better in-hand comfort.</p><p>Supposedly, Motorola is interested in equipping the phone with an "eco-leather" material on its back panel, rather than glass. This material rolls over that camera housing for a seamless aesthetic.</p><p>The publication adds that the G Stylus 2026 could feature a triple camera setup, though the specifics of those lenses are unknown. When it comes to potential upgrades, the rumors allege that it could see a battery slightly over 5,000mAh. We can stay hopeful with this, but it's worth noting that the G Stylus has kept the same 5,000mAh battery <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">for the past two iterations</a>. Charging strength is expected to remain the same as its 2025 iteration, much like its RAM/storage.</p><p>As far as colors go, the Moto G Stylus 2026 is allegedly keeping the same colorful back plus frame design. The leaked renders show off the phone in a supposed Lavender and black option, both of which see that same color applied to its side rails. The leak dipped into its potential power, which suggests a mid-range Qualcomm chip could get the gig.

Each device was equipped with the MediaTek 6300, a mid-range chip that offers pretty decent capabilities, good enough for daily tasks.</p><p>They'll likely struggle a little with the FPS in more intense mobile games, but they can get the job done in other areas. This is where Moto's G Stylus usually takes things up a little, at least, chip-wise. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-review">2025 version</a> included the Snapdragon 6 Gen 3, which was good at running games, but, as previously stated, mid-range chips often falter slightly with more graphically intense games.</p><p>The Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 was announced earlier this year, and Qualcomm said the chip was upgraded with an 11% faster CPU and 29% better graphics. <em>If </em>Motorola is looking at this chip for its next Stylus, maybe it'll hold its own a little better.</p> ]]></dc:content>

One area where Samsung is particularly lacking is portable chargers. The brand doesn't have a first-party magnetic power bank available yet, and that makes topping up ultra-thin phones like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge tricky. If you recall, Apple basically marketed the new MagSafe Battery as an essential accessory for the slim iPhone Air.</p><p>That looks to be changing, as a new Samsung magnetic power bank has appeared on the Wireless Power Consortium's Qi2 database (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/08/samsungs-qi2-magnet-wireless-battery-pack-leaks-fixes-a-galaxy-phone-problem/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). It's called the "Magnet Wireless Battery Pack," and has a certification date of Dec. 5, 2025. The power bank uses the magnetic power profile (MPP), according to the database listing, which means it features magnets for snap connection with Qi2 devices and cases.</p><p>Samsung's Magnet Wireless Power Bank supports Qi2.1, and it'll max out at 15W charging speeds as a result. It doesn't support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/wpc-announces-qi2-25w-major-android-devices-certification-new-standard">Qi2.2 25W</a>, so it can't deliver 25W speeds to supported devices. However, this is unlikely to become an issue, as most chargers and accessories cannot sustain wireless 25W power delivery for more than a few minutes.</p><p>The Magnet Wireless Power Bank has a Samsung model number of <strong>EB-U2500</strong>, per the listing. This follows a separate leak that revealed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-qi2-charger-leak-suggests-a-magsafe-rival-could-finally-come-to-the-galaxy-s26" target="_blank">Samsung Qi2 magnetic charging dock </a>last week.</p><p>All together, it looks like Samsung will indeed add embedded Qi2 magnets directly inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Samsung Galaxy S26 series</a>. The current Samsung Galaxy S25, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and Galaxy Z Fold 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">require a compatible case</a> to unlock full magnetic Qi2 support.</p><h2 id="addressing-a-unique-galaxy-design-flaw-2">Addressing a unique Galaxy design flaw</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's one interesting bit about the Samsung Magnet Wireless Battery Pack — the design. It mostly features a rectangular shape, from the one render available on the WPC database. However, there are clearly cutouts on the corners that curve around the Qi2 magnetic ring. This makes for an odd visual design, but it's there for a reason.</p><p>Samsung's rear camera lens arrangement can interfere with Qi2 charging accessories. While Apple and Google phones have more compact camera arrangements near the top of the devices, Samsung's single-lens arrangements protrude deeper into the body of the phone. This can prevent Qi2 chargers from sitting flush. It certainly looks like the Magnet Wireless Battery Pack is designed to address this compatibility issue once and for all.</p><p>Samsung hasn't confirmed the Magnet Wireless Battery Pack on its side of things yet. We could see it debut alongside the Galaxy S26 series next year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For instance, we spotted this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Smartwatch-Readiness-Exercise-Tracking/dp/B0B4MWCFV4" target="_blank"><strong>40% off discount on the Fitbit Versa 4 at Amazon</strong></a>, bringing it down to just $120.</p><p>The Versa 4 is our top pick for mid-range Fitbit options, despite Google recently pushing more of its advanced features toward the Pixel series. Regardless, the Versa 4 will still get users GPS, a 24-hour heart rate monitoring system, and a variety of exercise modes to choose from. It's also a bit smaller than most smartwatches, which makes it a worthy option for sleep monitoring when compared to the many bulkier options available.</p><p>The Versa 4 also includes access to apps like Fitbit Pay, Amazon's Alexa, Google Wallet and Maps, as well as offering daily stress management and readiness features. It also sports a long-lasting battery, 50-meter water resistance, and additional health metrics such as menstrual health tracking, guided breathing sessions, mindfulness programs, and still more. At the time of writing, this deal is available for the Black, Pink Sand, and Waterfall Blue versions of the smartwatch.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199.95" data-dimension48="$199.95" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Smartwatch-Readiness-Exercise-Tracking/dp/B0B4MWCFV4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="nidyRtDEkSoLRAWzzAmnjU" name="Fitbit Versa 4" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nidyRtDEkSoLRAWzzAmnjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Fitbit Versa 4:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Smartwatch-Readiness-Exercise-Tracking/dp/B0B4MWCFV4" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199.95" data-dimension48="$199.95" data-dimension25=""><del>$199.95</del> <strong>$119.95 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Fitbit Versa 4 is the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit#section-best-midrange">best mid-range Fitbit</a>, though the current $120 price tag makes it even more appealing amongst some of its competitors.

However, that only tells part of the story. Apple earned the top four spots, and four of its five best-selling smartphones were "premium" models. Meanwhile, Samsung didn't have a single premium handset on the top charts, instead earning its five places on the best-selling list with midrange Galaxy A models.</p><p>The best-selling smartphone in Q3 2025 was the base-model iPhone 16, by a wide margin. It had a 4% volume share, and this helped the iPhone 16 keep its first-place spot for the third consecutive quarter. Surprisingly, the top four spots were held by the iPhone 16 series — the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, and iPhone 16e, in that order — which usually experiences a seasonal sales decline before new models come out.</p><p>Another surprise was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro Max</a>, which earned the 10th-place spot despite going on sale at the tail end of the Q3 2025 tracking period. This suggests there is strong demand for the iPhone 17 series, and specifically, the most-expensive iPhone 17 Pro Max.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2404px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.05%;"><img id="jGz7UnucAkJWyAa8g2bhAh" name="Q3-2025-Counterpoint-Research-Sales" alt="The Counterpoint Research smartphone sales data for Q3 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jGz7UnucAkJWyAa8g2bhAh.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2404" height="1083" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Counterpoint Research)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's bread and butter in Q3 2025 was the midrange market. It held the fifth-place through ninth-place spots with its latest Galaxy A-series phones. The best-seller of the bunch was the Galaxy A16 5G, followed by the Galaxy A06, Galaxy A36, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-a56-is-the-worst-mid-range-phone-i-used-in-2025">Galaxy A56</a>, and Galaxy A16 4G. Samsung didn't have a single premium smartphone on the list. Last year, Samsung had the base-model Galaxy S24 on the Q3 2024 best-sellers list.</p><p>Counterpoint Research thinks Samsung's addition of AI features to the Galaxy A series via "Awesome Intelligence" could be driving sales.</p><p>"The mid-price segment’s presence in the top-10 best-selling smartphones is expected to remain strong, driven by the growing integration of GenAI features," the report explains. "These advancements make the segment more competitive, deliver greater value to consumers, and further bridge the user experience with flagship models."</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 could be experiencing an early seasonal decline as buyers look ahead to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 series</a>. However, its absence from the list is a big deal for Samsung. With only the Galaxy A-series appearing on the best-sellers list, Samsung doesn't have a single phone with a wholesale price of over $600 here.</p><p>Additionally, 5G phones covered all of the top five spots for the first time, with Counterpoint Research calling the technology "a key consumer preference across regions" as of Q3 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

During the show, Google offered a glimpse into the progress it has made with its Android XR smartglasses, and also announced some new capabilities coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Samsung's Galaxy XR</a> headset starting today(Dec. 8).</p><p>Starting off with Galaxy XR's new tricks, which Google says are designed to "help you fully experience the spatial capabilities of Android XR and allow you to fit your headset naturally into the things you do every day."</p><p>With the Galaxy XR's new "PC Connect" ability, users will be able to expand their workspace beyond the desktop to the headset, then pull in their desktop or a window from their computer and place it side-by-side with native apps from Google Play. This feature is super cool for when you need a multi-screen view to get things done, or if you'd like a more spatial view of the game you've been playing on the PC.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9xPC_FoaG0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Next up, Google is introducing "Travel mode," which is designed to transform any small area, such as a flight cabin, into an immersive workspace or personal home theater when you're stuck in the same space for several hours, allowing you to stay connected while on the go.</p><p>Speaking of work, the tech giant is also bringing "Likeness," a feature that will create a" realistic digital representation of your face that mirrors your facial expressions and hand gestures in real-time." This means that even though you're wearing the Galaxy XR headset, others will be able to see your reactions and expressions in real-time, making interactions feel more natural.</p><p>All of these features for the Galaxy XR Headset are currently in the Beta phase, and users can head to the Help center to get more information on how to try these tricks out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-floating-windows-chrome-official" alt="Three floating windows in an Android XR mixed reality environment with Chrome in the middle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="project-aura-by-xreal-2">Project Aura by XReal</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5871px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="HbBt8fvQ3zAUoPQLuaPpNh" name="Aura_3_TAS_XR_ Nov 06 2025_110 (1)" alt="Google shows off Project Aura XReal glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HbBt8fvQ3zAUoPQLuaPpNh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5871" height="3914" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is giving us the first look at Project Aura from XREAL, which is supposedly equipped with a 70-degree field of view and optical see-through technology. These glasses are said to overlay the digital content within your field of view, turning it into a massive screen for work or entertainment.  For instance, giving you a "floating recipe video while you cook or seeing step-by-step visual guides anchored to an appliance you are fixing," all this without blocking off your surroundings. Ofcourse, all with the help of Gemini.</p><p>That said, these XReal smartglasses come wired and are synced to a phone-sized device with a trackpad that handles the computing, according to Android Central's Senior Editor Michael Hicks, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tried-google-samsung-ai-glasses-prototypes-before-android-show-xr-edition-heres-what-i-learned">who was able to demo these glasses</a>.

One being the screen-free AI glasses, which have in-built speakers, microphones, and cameras to allow you to talk to Gemini, take photos, and get help. The second, display AI glasses, which add a small screen to show private, helpful information when you need it, such as navigation or translation. The former is set to arrive next year.</p><p>Google is also releasing Developer Preview 3, giving developers to build new experiences for AI glasses and wired XR glasses.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This time, I used these single-HUD glasses for over 30 minutes, testing Gemini, Google Maps and Translate, YouTube Music, Uber, and other glasses-based apps.</p><p>Next, Google had me try a new binocular glasses prototype — meaning they use dual displays with a wider FoV and 3D depth capabilities. Then I tested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye">XREAL Project Aura</a>, photographed above, which uses the same UI and pinch gestures as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Galaxy XR</a> but with a lighter form factor and 70-degree FoV.</p><h2 id="what-to-expect-from-android-xr-glasses-2">What to expect from Android XR glasses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7547px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZMnVe2ZdCf8TYieDQSfoKZ" name="XREAL-Project-Aura-close-up" alt="A photo of the XREAL Project Aura glasses sitting on a plastic pedestal, with dark lenses and a cord connected to a computing device with trackpad." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZMnVe2ZdCf8TYieDQSfoKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7547" height="4245" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">XREAL Project Aura </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XREAL)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's monocular prototype and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> software will serve as the foundation for Samsung's glasses hardware, which will launch next year with designs from Warby Parker and Gentle Monster. They'll also launch "screen-free" AI glasses in 2026, relying on speakers, mics, cameras, and Gemini smarts for an audio-led experience. They'll be a serious competitor to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses</a>.</p><p>The two-display version, by contrast, won't arrive until 2027 at the earliest. Juston Payne, Android XR's senior product director, explained that they still "weigh a little bit too much" for consumers, so Google will "wait until it's ready." I certainly felt the pinch on my nose, about on par with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3-OJxxW810" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The audio-only glasses will probably be the most affordable, thin, and popular. Payne said that Android XR pulls from years of audio-only tools created for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds</a> and Pixel accessibility tools like TalkBack, "leveraging what was already there."</p><p>I turned off the glasses HUD with a button tap and could still rely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> smarts that I'd normally get on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a>. Payne says he expects that "much of the usage" of these HUD glasses will be "with the display off," so using an audio-only version "isn't like a painful cut," Payne reassured me.</p><p>I didn't get a chance to photograph the prototypes, but the final versions won't look the same, anyway. What matters more is what I learned, both during the demo and behind the scenes, about what to expect from these new Samsung-made, Google-powered glasses, including how they'll sync with other Google devices and take advantage of Pixel camera expertise.</p><h2 id="these-smart-glasses-will-work-with-ios-but-the-android-integration-is-key-2">These smart glasses will work with iOS, but the Android integration is key</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LgQbzhPfbs6njQag6t8sBY" name="Android-XR-ask-AI" alt="A video still of a person wearing Google glasses asking about a bird on their palm, with a pop-up text showing info on its type." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LgQbzhPfbs6njQag6t8sBY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2256" height="1269" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>During my glasses prototype demo, they surprised me with the news that the eventual Samsung release will work on both Android and iOS. I assumed they'd make the same mistake as with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> and make it Android-exclusive, but Google's team stressed that iPhone owners will want these enhanced Google app experiences, too.</p><p>Most of the features I demoed on Google's AI glasses — image recognition and recipe advice via cameras, automatic live translation, shared camera view during calls, local restaurant recs, turn-by-turn navigation with a minimap, or beamforming to differentiate between my voice and others — are also available on Meta's AI or HUD glasses.</p><p>Meta achieved this by combining its own apps and smarts with major partners, enabling its AI commands to trigger basic tools such as starting a playlist or calling a contact. While Google has direct Android system access, it clearly realized it can deliver a similar piecemeal experience on iPhones and <em>vastly</em> expand its potential audience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2025px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cS9xg3YcAESQgZGJfhDeNY" name="Android-XR-maps" alt="A video still of a person using Android XR glasses to ask for a nearby coffeeshop and receive directions in Maps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cS9xg3YcAESQgZGJfhDeNY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2025" height="1139" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, the Android experience should be the definitive one, with direct access to all Play Store apps instead of specific access to the Google Workspace suite and Gemini, plus partner apps. And they'll sync with other Android accessories.</p><p>When I took a photo with the glasses, a preview appeared on a Google rep's Pixel Watch. He said that other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>, like Galaxy Watches, will integrate with Android XR so that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-watches-are-sidekick-gemini-needs-for-android-xr-to-work">gestures trigger certain actions</a> — similar to how Meta uses its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">sEMG band</a> for gesture controls.</p><p>Plus, on Android, the developer tools built for phones will carry over to the glasses. For example, if an app supports Live Update notifications, devs won't have to "do anything else" for glasses to show the same rich notifications, Payne says.</p><p>It's up to developers to decide whether to take advantage of the Android XR SDK and APIs to do more. Uber, for example, was "excited" by the Google Maps demo this May and decided to create a similar experience. During my demo, Google simulated a pick-up event; I could see an airport map to the pick-up zone by looking down, with a normal widget of my driver's details when looking ahead.</p><h2 id="the-main-challenges-that-google-had-to-solve-2">The main challenges that Google had to solve</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1591px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gA49nNS822vdTmiBHxxBBV" name="gentle-monster-warby-parker-partnerships-android-xr" alt="Android XR partners Gentle Monster and Warby Parker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gA49nNS822vdTmiBHxxBBV.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1591" height="895" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don't know what the Warby Parker and Gentle Monster designs will look like, but Payne promises that these Samsung Glasses will be "eyewear first," with both prescriptions and "sun tints" available, as well as "stylistic variety" so anyone can find a pair that matches their "preferences."</p><p>But their primary strategy to keep these glasses comfortable and stylish, according to Payne, is to "offload" as much computation as possible to the phone, enabling smaller batteries and thinner frames.</p><p>That's why they're not selling the two-display glasses in 2026; while they're "nowhere near as heavy as 70 or 80 grams," they're still above the "comfort threshold" that consumers will accept. But Payne seems to think they'll solve this hardware issue soon. It'll be exciting when they do, as weight aside, this prototype was more pleasurable to use, with a wider, centered field and depth added to certain apps — like 3D buildings in Google Maps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8vv6mm2zR2gAxAWtyt5ENg" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-06" alt="Pixel 10 with a blue Pixelsnap case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vv6mm2zR2gAxAWtyt5ENg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another smart glasses challenge that Google and Samsung will have to solve is camera quality. Meta glasses can capture <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-camera-review" target="_blank">high-resolution photos</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearing-the-oakley-meta-hstn-smart-ai-glasses-during-spartan-race" target="_blank">stabilize videos</a>, but they have limitations, especially in low-light photography, framing, and zoom.</p><p>Payne says Samsung is responsible for the cameras in the eventual consumer release, but it's a "tight partnership" with Google handling the post-processing and AI image-editing side of things. So I asked Payne what to expect.</p><p>Payne acknowledged readily that "physics will get in the way" of giving these glasses the same camera quality as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>, because frames can't fit large sensors, but he's confident that Google's "computational photography investments" will help the glasses "push up to that level of quality." I also assume that tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> will help you remove the excess details around your subject.</p><p>On that note, when I told Payne that my current AI glasses don't always know which object in front of me I'm asking about, he promised that Gemini is good at "inferring" the subject, but suggested people can "point at" or hold something, and Gemini will use that context when answering.</p><h2 id="xreal-project-aura-matters-as-much-as-galaxy-xr-for-android-xr-s-future-2">XREAL Project Aura matters as much as Galaxy XR for Android XR's future</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2233px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mpzwD6hGFTyofSbqWTpXdi" name="project-aura-tease" alt="Project Aura glasses teased" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mpzwD6hGFTyofSbqWTpXdi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2233" height="1256" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite a decade of Google Glass, VR headsets, and AR prototypes, Payne says that it's still "early days for XR overall," with 2026 as a "big year" because the upcoming AI and HUD glasses will be the first smart glasses with an "app ecosystem."</p><p>But if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> is to become the 'next large computing platform,' it can't just be the Samsung & Google show. Google will need it to be a proper open system, with more partners. And that starts with XREAL Project Aura becoming a success story.</p><p>When I tested XREAL Project Aura, it had the same onboarding experience as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-headset-can-live-up-to-its-price-tag">Galaxy XR</a>, with an identical pinching tutorial and the same apps and Gemini integration. The performance was seamless, the FoV was much wider than on other smart glasses, and it still has the upside of syncing with a Switch or Steam Deck for gaming.</p><p>These glasses certainly have the potential to find an audience, but what happens <em>after</em> launch? Will Project Aura receive Android support and software updates at the same cadence as Galaxy XR? Or will it lag behind as Google prioritizes its biggest partner? We've seen this in recent years with Wear OS, as long-term partners like Fossil and Mobvoi have fallen behind and given up on smartwatches.</p><p>Hopefully, Android XR sticks to a more collaborative and supportive path, growing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> category even further.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the rumor, Xiaomi could debut this Ultra device right after Christmas, on December 26. This debut could bring two varying RAM/storage variants, which, as the publication notes, mirrors what Xiaomi has done previously.</p><p>If we're going by that theory, the 17 Ultra could feature a 12/256GB and a 16/1TB variant for roughly 6,499 yuan (~$919) and 7,799 yuan (~$1,103), respectively.</p><p>Interestingly, the tipster's rumors continue, claiming that this alleged December 26 debut date could be preceded by a brief pre-order period. Xiaomi could begin this pre-order stage around December 15 through December 25. Typically, OEMs debut and begin their pre-order periods simultaneously, so perhaps we're looking at a December 15 (or rather a December 14 in the U.S.) announcement date from Xiaomi.</p><p>Of course, this is speculation, so take these rumors with a grain of salt for now.</p><h2 id="an-ultra-picture-2">An "Ultra" picture</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3foQVbAMmjwSJNNWRwQED7" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3foQVbAMmjwSJNNWRwQED7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier rumors about the Xiaomi 17 Ultra started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-17-series-pro-pro-max-launch">shortly after the 17 series</a> originally debuted. Those Ultra theories alleged that the Chinese OEM was preparing a sharp difference for it, by granting it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-rumored-17-ultra-may-support-satellite-connectivity-over-the-latest-trio">satellite connectivity capabilities</a>. Those rumors, after spotting it passing through a Chinese database, suggest the phone will offer Tiantong-1 and Beidou technology. Multiple Chinese OEMs have used this tech before, likely indicating the 17 Ultra will see text and call support.</p><p>Rumors add that the device's satellite connectivity was only spotted for its Chinese variant, potentially leaving out any global users if it reaches more regions.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/these-xiaomi-17-ultra-leaks-predict-a-major-photography-upgrade-is-on-the-way">rumor to sink our teeth into</a> concerned the phone's photographic capabilities. Reports at the top of December purported that the 17 Ultra could feature Leica-branded lenses and hardware upgrades to reduce chromatic aberration, as well as reflections.</p><p>Four lenses could pack its rear panel, consisting of a 200MP lens alongside three 50MP lenses. Up until now, talks have claimed Xiaomi was aiming for a 2026 release of the 17 Ultra. Things have reportedly shifted now that we're further into December, but Xiaomi has yet to confirm anything itself.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google found itself facing considerable antitrust scrutiny a several years ago, and multiple lawsuits against the company are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store/google-and-epics-settlement-proposal-could-finally-end-the-multi-year-play-store-dispute">now nearing a resolution</a>. One such case, filed by the attorneys general in all 50 U.S. states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, accused Google of monopolizing app distribution and in-app billing methods.</p><p>Google settled the case in 2023 and denied any wrongdoing, but now, there's new information about when settlement payments will go out to users — and how much they'll get. The official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googleplaystateagantitrustlitigation.com" target="_blank">settlement website</a> confirms that payments from the $700 million fund will go out automatically to affected users via PayPal or Venmo.</p><p>You're eligible to receive money from the settlement if you bought an app from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Google Play Store</a>, or made an in-app purchase using Google Play Billing, between Aug. 16, 2016 and Sept. 30, 2023. Users need to have an account located in a U.S. state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands to be a part of the settlement. That's quite a large scope, and most Google Play Store users active during that timeframe will likely be eligible for settlement payments.</p><p>According to settlement documents, the minimum settlement payments will be at least $2 each (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-play-settlement-payout/" target="_blank">ZDNet</a>). You could receive a higher amount depending on how much you spent on the Google Play Store between 2016 and 2023. Crucially, most payments will go out automatically. There's no need to file a claim or take any action — you'll get an email or text with the address or number associated with your Google Play account when the payments are ready.</p><h2 id="when-will-affected-play-store-users-get-their-cash-2">When will affected Play Store users get their cash?</h2><p>The settlement details also outline when you'll start receiving money. There are a few key dates to remember: Feb. 19, 2026 is the exclusion and objection deadline, while April 30, 2026 is the fairness hearing. You may want to exclude yourself or object to the settlement if you want to forfeit your settlement and keep your right to sue Google over these claims individually.</p><p>The fairness hearing is where a judge will consider whether to approve the settlement.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This year has been full of notable releases for Honor, delivering fantastic options for the upper mid-range and premium segments. But the Honor Magic 7 Lite, which debuted at the very beginning of the year, but the ancient processor held it back in too many ways.</p><p>That's where the Honor Magic 8 Lite comes in. It upgrades to the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 tech, granting snappy performance to nearly everything on the phone. It retains the 108MP camera system from the Magic 7 Lite, which isn't nearly as good as the numbers suggest, but Honor's bevy of AI tricks, both in the camera software and the OS, help make up for what the hardware might lack.</p><p>And while the design of most of the phone feels extraordinarily mid-tier with an all-plastic construction, the Magic 8 Lite fits the "don't judge a book by its cover" idiom perfectly. That build is the toughest thing you'll see in almost any smartphone to date, including class-leading drop and ingress protection, an absolutely enormous battery, and six years of promised software updates in Europe to back that up. It's an impressive new entry that's worth taking a look at, for sure.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-lite-price-availability-and-specs"><span>Honor Magic 8 Lite: Price, availability, and specs</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="F46cgADMHzekjVnw9kF32P" name="honor-magic-8-lite-unboxing" alt="Unboxing the Honor Magic 8 Lite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F46cgADMHzekjVnw9kF32P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite is available in Europe and most countries where Honor phones are sold globally.

That's not to say the rest of the phone is bad, but these four areas are really what set this phone apart from the pack at this price.</p><p>While you might never imagine it from the all-plastic construction, this phone is as durable as it gets before entering the typically awful "rugged phone" category. It's got IP68 and IP69K ingress protection, plus a drop rating at up to 2.5m (8.2ft) on most hard surfaces, including cobblestone, marble, asphalt, and more.</p><p>It's also the perfect phone for people who find themselves using their phones while wet. Whether this means your fingers are wet while cooking, trying to use the phone in the rain (or shower), or just want to peruse TikTok while in a hot tub and never want to worry about dropping it in the water, things don't get better than this. Being able to actually use the screen while it's wet is something only flagships from Honor and OnePlus have been blessed with until now.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="J9jeGZncZVYJZTNTJLJEUd" name="honor-magic-8-lite-07" alt="The sides of the Honor Magic 8 Lite, including buttons and ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J9jeGZncZVYJZTNTJLJEUd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WB7pzJCnDunKcH6DbFbGUd" name="honor-magic-8-lite-06" alt="The sides of the Honor Magic 8 Lite, including buttons and ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WB7pzJCnDunKcH6DbFbGUd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UEv3Uyj5aRKGDW3FgEqLTd" name="honor-magic-8-lite-05" alt="The sides of the Honor Magic 8 Lite, including buttons and ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UEv3Uyj5aRKGDW3FgEqLTd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6NpZYup6iMnU9XSattvGVd" name="honor-magic-8-lite-08" alt="The sides of the Honor Magic 8 Lite, including buttons and ports" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6NpZYup6iMnU9XSattvGVd.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>While the chasis is irritatingly flat all around the sides — a trend I detest because of how difficult it is to pick up from a table and generally uncomfortable to hold for long periods of time — the camera island has a great unique style that's immediately identifiable. The stereo speaker system onboard is crisp, clean, and clear, with a maximum volume mode that's nothing short of impressive.</p><p>Battery life is beyond incredible, owing to a combination of a power-efficient processor paired with a 7500mAh battery. You'll easily get 2-3 days out of a charge no matter how you use the phone. Thankfully, unlike the Magic 7 Lite, the Magic 8 Lite has great everyday performance that matches the best competition in this price range.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eavs4hrz8potKpWkGznozJ" name="honor-magic-8-lite-pwm-measurement-all" alt="PWM charts and photos at 1/6400 shutter speed of the Honor Magic 8 Lite's dimming methods, including PWM dimming at low brightness" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eavs4hrz8potKpWkGznozJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The display is also excellent, sporting a 120Hz OLED that's perfectly viewable in sunlight with flagship brightness levels. This one uses DC-like dimming all the way down to about 20%, and then kicks in to 3840Hz <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> below that. From most angles, it seems like this is a perfect display for flicker-sensitive people, but it's got one big problem: dithering.</p><p>That's because while Honor says this display is capable of 10-bit color, it's actually an 8-bit display that uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering">temporal dithering</a> to fake the additional 2-bit depth. That means anyone sensitive to flickering could find this display uncomfortable, which clearly clashes with Honor's claim that this is a "risk-free" display. At the least, this is still a much better display for flicker-sensitive folks than something from Samsung or Google in this price range.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yNjgdX6PDMFVakHZd36RvB" name="honor-magic-8-lite-09" alt="The home screen of the Honor Magic 8 Lite running Magic OS 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yNjgdX6PDMFVakHZd36RvB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor is launching this one with Magic OS 9, which is based on Android 15. That doesn't make much sense given the Magic 8 Pro launches with Magic OS 10 (based on Android 16) but, at the very least, European customers can expect to see the Magic OS 10 update land in April 2026.</p><p>Beyond that, expect five more years of OS and security updates if you live in Europe. It's a fantastic pledge that's only outdone by Samsung and Google by one year. I don't much care about the difference between six or seven years of updates, though, because, by that point, a mid-range phone will likely be sluggish and nearly unusable.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-lite-what-could-use-improvement"><span>Honor Magic 8 Lite: What could use improvement</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ysrTGjBrrX5owa6oGmZ6Gm" name="honor-magic-8-lite-04" alt="The round camera island of the Honor Magic 8 Lite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ysrTGjBrrX5owa6oGmZ6Gm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of design and ergonomics, the Magic 8 Pro is a far nicer phone to hold. That has less to do with materials used and more to do with the overly flat design the Magic 8 Lite uses, particularly on the backside. Some people like the trend of fully flat phones with flat sides, but I am not one of those people. Curves fit human hands better than flat objects, and I'm just really not sure why this has become a trend with this year's releases.</p><p>Honor also really needs to work on its haptics. Even Honor's best phones use lesser-tier haptics, and the ones in the Magic 8 Lite feel undeniably cheap. They're so bad they make me question the build quality of the phone, even though I know it's better than these make it feel.</p><p>Honor is also sticking with its awful 2-year update promise for countries outside of Europe where this phone is sold, meaning you'll only see Android 17 on the Magic 8 Lite before Honor drops support. It's clear this is a model more geared toward Europe than anywhere else, and that affects my ability to recommend it outside of that continent.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

main camera is typically excellent at 1x or 2x zoom, things fall apart quickly at 3x and beyond. Zooming in to 3x and beyond almost always creates an extremely oversharpened, digital-looking image that lacks contrast and often has poor color accuracy.</p><p>Aside from poor zoom quality, I've found several instances where the camera will overexpose a shot in random lighting conditions, creating a cheap look and feel to the images. This problem doesn't seem to carry over to the 5MP ultrawide sensor, which does a much better job with colors and exposure, but lacks detail because of the low resolution.</p><p>Camera speed can be extremely hit or miss, as well. There's no quick launch option on this phone, so the quickest way to launch it is to turn the screen on and swipe to enter the camera. There's no way to double-press a button and launch the camera. Couple that with a long load time for the viewfinder, which can sometimes take 3-4 seconds when the phone is busy, and you end up with a frustratingly inconsistent experience.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-lite-the-competition"><span>Honor Magic 8 Lite: The competition</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8awPRuDVzc74Uc5BCcrwk9" name="oneplus-nord-4-23.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8awPRuDVzc74Uc5BCcrwk9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At this price range, you have to pick your battles. The Magic 8 Lite excels in battery life, charging speed, and durability, but the Motorola Edge 60 Fusion offers a nicer feeling vegan leather build with a 1.2m drop rating and IP69 ingress protection at a much lower price.</p><p>If you're looking for a different style and don't like Honor's UI or hardware designs, the OnePlus Nord 4 or Nothing Phone 3a, and Nothing Phone 3a Pro all offer stunning designs with cleaner OS's. Camera quality and durability isn't as good on those phones, but they offer great software experience that Android fans will be more approving of.</p><p>Of course, you can't count out Samsung to offer something for every price range, either. The Galaxy A36 is a bit cheaper but is slightly worse in every way, while just a tad more money will get you a Galaxy A56 with a faster processor and better cameras. Both of these phones have harsh, flickering displays and substantially worse battery life, but Samsung's software update policy and its rich features might be a better fit for some people.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-8-lite-should-you-buy"><span>Honor Magic 8 Lite: Should you buy?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S4CB5rKZTtZjZu2ra6SEDK" name="honor-magic-8-lite-wet-02" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Lite with water on its back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4CB5rKZTtZjZu2ra6SEDK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy if...</strong></p><ul><li>You want class-leading battery life and durability</li><li>You live in Europe and want a phone with six years of software support</li><li>Samsungs OLEDs give you a headache (this one won't)</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy if...</strong></p><ul><li>You often take photos using 3x zoom and beyond</li><li>You live outside of Europe (only 2 years of software updates promised globally)</li><li>You're sensitive to display dithering</li></ul><p>Honor's global update program means there's no reason to buy this phone if you live outside of Europe. A scant 2 years of software updates is terrible by any measure, while European customers get a much better six years of updates for the same hardware. That's particularly a shape since Honor's software is finally at the point where it doesn't feel like a second-rate iOS clone.</p><p>I use a ton of Honor devices regularly and love how well Honor's devices work with each other. The Magic 8 Lite fits in perfectly with that and will work impressively well with other Honor phones, tablets, laptops, and more. Even if you're not a regular Honor user, this phone will last you for days on a single charge and still hang around in case you drop it — yes, even on pavement.</p><p>And while the camera won't be winning any awards for speed or quality — no phone at this price range will, really — the main camera is more than capable of taking great shots from time to time. Of course, overall performance, battery life, and software amenities help make up for some of the phone's few shortcomings, making this an easy recommendation at £399.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3><h2 id="where-is-the-honor-magic-8-lite-available-2">Where is the Honor Magic 8 Lite available?</h2><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite is available in Europe and China as of December, with a wider worldwide rollout happening just after that.</p><h2 id="does-the-honor-magic-8-lite-use-pwm-dimming-or-dithering-2">Does the Honor Magic 8 Lite use PWM dimming or dithering?</h2><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite's OLED display uses DC dimming from 21-100% brightness. At 20% brightness and below, the phone switches to 3840Hz PWM dimming. This high frequency PWM dimming is nearly 10x faster than offered by companies like Apple or Samsung and should prove to be very comfortable, even for flicker-sensitive users.</p><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite uses temporal dithering at all times to create 10-bit color depth. The OLED panel is 8-bit by default, and a 2-bit software dithering algorithm is employed. There is no way to disable dithering on this phone. Dithering can cause discomfort for some users and make the display unusable for them.</p><h2 id="what-cameras-does-the-honor-magic-8-lite-use-2">What cameras does the Honor Magic 8 Lite use?</h2><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite uses a 108mp main camera on the back, which is capable of 10x digital zoom. The phone also employs a 5mp ultrawide camera on the back. The front-facing selfie camera uses a 16mp sensor.</p><h2 id="what-camera-ai-features-are-supported-on-the-magic-8-lite-2">What camera AI features are supported on the Magic 8 Lite?</h2><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite supports AI Remove Reflection, AI Eraser, AI Erase Passers-by, AI Upscale, AI Outpainting, AI Cutout, AI Face Tune-Eyes Open, Moving Photo Collage, and Moving Photo Share.</p><h2 id="how-many-software-updates-will-the-magic-8-lite-receive-2">How many software updates will the Magic 8 Lite receive?</h2><p>The Honor Magic 8 Lite launches with Magic OS 9 (Android 15) and will receive six operating system updates in Europe. That includes six years of security updates during that time. Magic OS 10, based on Android 16, is expected in April 2026.</p><p>Other parts of the world will only receive two major OS updates and two years of security updates.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, that old experience is finally gone.</p><p>Google Drive on the web is getting rid of its old, clunky viewer. What used to be a basic, sometimes frustrating way to open PDFs, images, and videos <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/12/google-drive-web-modern-file-viewer-interface.html" target="_blank">is being replaced</a> with a cleaner, more useful workspace.</p><p>This update fixes common complaints about how you move around, organize, and use the Drive viewer. If you spend a lot of time jumping between documents or reviewing media straight from your browser, you’ll feel the difference immediately.</p><h2 id="pdfs-in-drive-finally-make-sense-2">PDFs in Drive finally make sense</h2><p>The biggest improvement is for PDFs, which have always been a weak spot in Drive. The new viewer now shows a table of contents on the left if the file has one, along with thumbnail previews for every page. You no longer have to scroll endlessly through a hundred-page document hoping to land on the right paragraph.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.56%;"><img id="Lqex8CcbQ3soQEQ9cazqSF" name="Google-Drive-file-viewer-new" alt="Google Drive file viewer on the web with a left sidebar for table of contents" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lqex8CcbQ3soQEQ9cazqSF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="937" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This new interface pairs nicely with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drives-new-ai-audio-summaries-make-pdfs-effortless">Drive’s Gemini-powered audio summaries</a>. You can generate and listen to a quick overview right from the side panel, or jump into the “Audio overviews” folder to replay anything you’ve saved.</p><p>Google didn’t stop at PDFs, though. Video files get a surprisingly powerful upgrade with a transcript search tool built right into the viewer. Instead of scrubbing back and forth trying to find the exact moment someone mentions a keyword, you can type the word directly into the transcript and jump straight to that point in the video.</p><p>This feature saves you time right away, especially if you work with long recordings or meeting videos.</p><p>All of this sits atop a refreshed interface that looks cleaner and behaves more predictably. The toolbar has been redesigned, the file menu is more intuitive, and the overall layout feels less cramped.</p><p>The rollout is already underway for users on Google’s Rapid Release track, while Scheduled Release domains will begin seeing the new viewer starting December 11, 2025.

There are currently Modes in Android for Do Not Disturb, Bedtime, and Driving. In a future update, Google could add a "Transiting" mode for commuters.</p><p>Android Authority discovered code related to a new Mode in the latest Android Canary release. The so-called Transiting Mode features a "while transiting" trigger that could automatically enable the Mode when your Android phone detects you're on a bus or train. It would work similar to Driving Mode, which has its own triggers based on motion sensors and Bluetooth connections that are used for activation.</p><p>Here are the exact code strings that preview a possible Mode for public transit:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name="zen_mode_trigger_title_transit">While transiting</string><string name="zen_mode_inspiration_transit">Optimize your device for a smoother public transit experience</string><string name="zen_mode_blurb_transit">Enjoy a better transit ride with automatic settings adjustments</string></code></pre><p>The Mode will make "automatic settings adjustments," according to the code strings, and "optimize your device for a smoother public transit experience." It's unclear exactly how Transiting Mode will do that. Like other Modes, the system could adjust volume, notification settings, and ring/vibration preferences automatically.</p><p>It could tap into other work-in-progress features, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-could-steal-a-crucial-ios-18-feature-that-helps-curb-motion-sickness">Motion Cues</a>, which have been in the works for over a year. Motion Cues aims to provide visual cues to curb motion sickness, and that's something that could help public transit riders.</p><h2 id="when-transiting-mode-might-publicly-release-2">When Transiting Mode might publicly release</h2><p>The next major Android release is Android 16 QPR3, which is tabbed for a March 2026 launch. However, as Transiting Mode is only a work-in-progress feature revealed by code strings, we don't know for sure when it will be released publicly. If the Transiting Mode code eventually appears in the Android 16 QPR3 beta release channel, that could be a good sign it's nearing an official release.</p><p>For now, Transiting Mode code has only appeared in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-canary-release-channel-devs-rigorous-testing-pixels">Android Canary</a> release channel, which contains the earliest and most experimental Android developer builds.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google is rolling out a new feature that surfaces the right pass at the right time, based on where you are.</p><p>Instead of digging through a cluttered list of passes at the worst possible time (think boarding gate, train turnstile, or concert security line), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> can now automatically surface the exact pass you need, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/04/google-wallet-nearby-notifications/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> reports. After teasing it at Google I/O in May, the tech giant is rolling out its “Set up nearby notifications” alerts, a new feature that pops up the right ticket, card, or boarding pass the moment you get close to where you’ll need it.</p><p>So, instead of acting like a digital filing cabinet, Wallet is now becoming context-aware. As you approach a relevant location — an airport terminal, a venue entrance, a transit gate, or even a store where you use a loyalty card — the app sends a push notification that opens the matching pass instantly. You get it with one tap, without scrolling through stacks of passes or guessing which one is correct.</p><h2 id="privacy-trade-off-2">Privacy trade-off</h2><p>Setting up nearby notifications is straightforward. When you open a pass that supports the feature, Wallet prompts you to enable it, which requires granting location access “all the time.”</p><p>This means Google Wallet can continuously track your device's location, even when you are not using the app. It’s a privacy trade-off, but in return, you get a hands-free experience that feels genuinely helpful.</p><p>This rollout blends in another handy travel feature: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay/google-wallet-making-it-easier-to-catch-your-plane-or-train-on-android">automated flight check-in alerts</a>. Users are seeing notifications urging them to "Check in to your flight" well before they head to the airport. It appears Wallet is pulling this data directly from confirmation emails in Gmail.</p><p>This rollout is hitting devices right now, just in time for the holiday travel rush.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Google Pixel Watch's AOD is handled by the Google Clock app, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/it-finally-happened-google-drops-third-party-support-for-its-wear-os-clock-app">recently became a Pixel-exclusive</a> on Wear OS. After receiving the update, Pixel Watch models can display timers, stopwatches, and media controls on their always-on displays.</p><p>The update is rolling out as part of Google Clock version 6.11, and it's not widely available yet (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-watch-aod-timer-stopwatch-controls-3622820/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). A few users on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1pew723/timer_now_works_with_aod/" target="_blank">Google Pixel Watch subreddit</a> reported gaining access to the feature after updating the Google Clock app to version 6.11. Others are seeing version 6.10 of the Google Clock app as the newest available version for their Pixel Watch, suggesting this is a limited rollout for now.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1pew723/timer_now_works_with_aod">Timer now works with AOD!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch">r/PixelWatch</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Previously, the Pixel Watch's standard behavior for the always-on display involved darkening open apps and showing a generic digital clock in front of them. When closed or timed out, the Pixel Watch's AOD would return to its saved watch face. Any app that lacks AOD support could use the "Force Global AOD Experience" developer option, which dims the display but keeps your last screen visible or active, as of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5.1</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, not many developers chose to enable the "Force Global AOD Experience" option — including Google. That is, until this Google Clock app update, which allows stopwatches and timers to continue when the AOD is active. Additionally,  it adds AOD support for media controls, including play/pause and next/previous, all with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a> flair.</p><p>There are a few limitations of the Clock app's new AOD capabilities. Some frequently-updating graphics and fields are omitted when the AOD is active. Namely, you won't see the countdown ring for timers or the number of seconds remaining. While stopwatches keep the second counter, it also loses the ring.</p><p>You can try to force the Google Clock update on your Pixel Watch by opening the Google Play Store on your smartwatch and scrolling all the way to the bottom. There, you'll find a <strong>Manage apps</strong> button. After tapping it, you can check for a Google Clock update. If available, follow the on-screen prompts to install it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

What was once a badge of authenticity has, according to European Union regulators, become a practice designed to trick users. The rules have now caught up with X.</p><p>Following a two-year investigation, the European Commission fined Elon Musk’s X €120 million (about $140 million). This is the first financial penalty issued under the EU’s new Digital Services Act (DSA).</p><p>If you’ve kept up with the ongoing conflict between Musk and European regulators, this outcome might not surprise you. But the reason for the fine hits closer to home for anyone who uses the platform daily.</p><p>At the heart of this €120 million ($140 million) bill is the blue checkmark. It used to indicate that someone was a verified public figure, such as a journalist, celebrity, or politician. After Musk took over, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/twitter-x-could-start-charging-users-subscription-fees">the meaning changed</a>.

Without proper identity checks, users can’t easily tell if an account is real. The Commission <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2934" target="_blank">said</a> this makes it easier for scams and impersonation to happen.</p><p>The blue checkmark wasn’t the only issue. The advertising database, which should show who buys ads, when, and to whom, was unclear. Important details, such as who paid for the ads, what they were about, and a searchable record, were missing. That fails the DSA’s transparency requirements, the EU says.</p><p>Last but not least, researchers studying disinformation or platform misuse can’t access the needed public data. X’s policies reportedly blocked scraping and imposed delays, turning access into a maze. That too violates the DSA.</p><p>X now has 60 working days to explain how it will fix the blue checkmark problem, and 90 days to meet the rules for ad transparency and data access.</p><p>If X follows the rules, it could set a new standard for how verification works on big platforms, making it clearer, more honest, and less about paying for status. Otherwise, the EU may start issuing regular fines and push for real identity checks instead of just paid subscriptions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After months of rumors and speculation, Samsung finally took the wraps off its first-ever trifolding smartphone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/its-official-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-launch">Galaxy Z TriFold was unveiled</a> on December 1, 2025, and it offers many benefits and a whole new user experience compared to the standard Galaxy Z Fold lineup we've all come to know.</p><p>However, Samsung isn't the first to introduce a trifolding smartphone. Huawei unveiled its Mate XT Ultimate last year, which actually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">intrigued us quite a bit</a>, and followed it up with a slightly upgraded 's' version, called Huawei Mate XTs, earlier this year.</p><p>Both Huawei and Samsung's trifolding phones offer different form factors and designs. But with Huawei already on its second generation of trifolding phones, does its device actually offer more or better features? How different are these two trifolding phones? Let's see how they compare.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Huawei Mate XTs: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kkcXWE2aYNQWhQ6PRbQqoS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-tri-fold-supersaf-3" alt="Hands-on images of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kkcXWE2aYNQWhQ6PRbQqoS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SuperSaf on YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/introducing-galaxy-z-trifold-the-shape-of-whats-next-in-mobile-innovation">introduced</a> the Galaxy Z TriFold on December 1, 2025. The company didn't showcase the device at an event, but quietly released it through a press release. The Galaxy Z TriFold will be available for purchase in Samsung's home country, South Korea, starting December 12, 2025, for KRW 3,594,000 (~$2,440). The trifolding phone comes in just one color variant called Crafted Black.</p><p>Following the launch in Korea, Samsung will bring the Galaxy Z TriFold to other regions, including China, Taiwan, Singapore, the UAE, and the U.S., but the company hasn't confirmed launch dates for these markets just yet.</p><p>The Huawei Mate XTs was introduced in early September 2025 in China. Currently, the Mate XTs is available only in China, but the brand may launch it globally at a later stage, similar to what it did with the first-generation Mate XT.</p><p>In China, the Mate XTs starts at 17,999 CNY (~$2,550) for the base model with 256GB storage and 16GB RAM. It goes up to 21,999 CNY (~$3,100) for the top model with 1TB storage and 16GB RAM. Unlike the Galaxy Z TriFold, the Mate XTs comes in four colors: Red, Black, Purple, and White.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts-design-and-build-2">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Huawei Mate XTs: Design and build</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BkMdRqz7xdVRPZmhfhw9m7" name="huawei-mate-xts-1" alt="Image of Huawei Mate XTs from the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BkMdRqz7xdVRPZmhfhw9m7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The difference in design between traditional slab smartphones and even book-style foldables is limited due to their similar form factor, but when you have two movable hinges and three foldable display parts (hence the name 'trifold'), the result is exactly the difference you get between the Galaxy Z TriFold and the Huawei Mate XTs, with both opting for very different approaches.</p><p>On the Huawei Mate XTs, you get a single large 10.2-inch foldable display that folds twice (almost in a Z shape) to form the cover display, which works and looks like a traditional smartphone, though one edge is made of a plastic foldable panel. The Mate XTs can then unfold twice, first into a book-style foldable similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppos-new-foldable-is-insanely-thin-and-packs-a-huge-battery-but-itll-cost-you">Oppo Find N5</a>, and then fully open into a large 10-inch tablet-like display.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold takes a different approach. Samsung says that in order to protect the inner foldable display, since it's quite sensitive, it designed the hinge system differently.</p><p>Think of the Galaxy Z TriFold as a U-shaped foldable with two vertical sides folding inward. The cover display is a completely separate outer screen that measures 6.5 inches and is actually the same panel used on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>'s cover display. This cover display boasts up to 2,600 nits of peak brightness and supports up to a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rd8TgnBpGtECzUiS7iix5J" name="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-7" alt="Two Galaxy Z TriFolds next to each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rd8TgnBpGtECzUiS7iix5J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of build, Samsung seems to take the lead since it uses advanced and premium materials such as Corning Glass Ceramic 2 for the outer cover display, while the rest of the phone is protected by ceramic glass fiber reinforced polymer and an Advanced Armor Aluminum frame for maximum durability.</p><p>The company has also used two titanium hinges for extra strength to protect the foldable from drops and jerks. Moreover, despite being Samsung's first trifolding phone, the company has paid close attention to durability, with the device offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-waterproof">IP48 dust- and water-resistance</a>.</p><p>Using the same folding display as the cover display keeps the Mate XTs from having a larger profile. The Mate XTs is thinner than the Galaxy Z TriFold when unfolded, with a 3.6mm vs 3.9mm profile, and in general, the Mate XTs has a slightly smaller footprint than the Galaxy Z TriFold.</p><p>Coming to the specs of the foldable displays used on both phones, Samsung again takes the lead. The Galaxy Z TriFold's inner foldable display is a large 10-inch LTPO AMOLED 2X panel with a 1584 x 2160 resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and 1,600 nits of peak brightness.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vWpVCJY8m2ZJSxKB88xi3T" name="samsung-galaxy-z-tri-fold-supersaf-4" alt="Hands-on images of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vWpVCJY8m2ZJSxKB88xi3T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SuperSaf on YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Mate XTs has a slightly bigger 10.2-inch LTPO OLED panel, and even though it offers a higher 2232 x 3184 resolution, it comes with only a 90Hz refresh rate, which is uncommon for most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a>, let alone a smartphone that costs over $2000.</p><p>Both Samsung and Huawei include a slim kickstand case in the box with their trifolding phones to help the device stand up for watching content or productivity, but the case also acts as hinge protection (or, in Huawei's case, a protector for the exposed part of the screen), making it almost necessary to use.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Huawei Mate XTs: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.58%;"><img id="bukQhooK7gDq5ZArhKP9xN" name="Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="Samsung unveils Galaxy Z Trifold, and it will arrive in the US next year!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bukQhooK7gDq5ZArhKP9xN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="714" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qualcomm recently introduced the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-benchmarks-reveal-qualcomms-dominance-yet-again">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> processor, and while Samsung foldables usually pack the latest Snapdragon chips, the Galaxy Z TriFold actually uses the previous-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p><p>However, that shouldn't be an issue for anyone looking to buy this trifolding phone since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Elite is still a very capable chipset</a> and offers more performance and raw power than you'd realistically need from a foldable.</p><p>Huawei's Mate XTs, similar to other smartphones from the brand, uses the company's own Kirin 9020 chipset. For those unaware, this is an octa-core chip with one core clocked at 2.4GHz, three at 2.00GHz, and four at 1.6GHz.

The Huawei Mate XTs starts at 256GB and also offers 512GB and 1TB variants. Both phones offer 16GB RAM across all models.</p><p>For battery life, both phones pack large 5,600mAh batteries. And even though Samsung gives the Galaxy Z TriFold the same 45W charging speed as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, it's still outshone by the Mate XTs, which offers 66W fast wired charging.</p><p>Both phones support wireless charging as well, with the Galaxy Z TriFold offering 15W wireless input, while Huawei takes the lead again with support for up to 50W wireless charging.</p><p>Both devices also include a side-mounted fingerprint sensor for unlocking, with no in-display sensor support on any of the devices. However, it's worth noting that the Huawei foldable, similar to most Huawei smartphones, doesn't offer 5G compatibility in most global regions.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</p></th><th  ><p>Huawei Mate XTs</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8 (Android 16)</p></td><td  ><p>HarmonyOS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>Cover display: 6.5-inch, FHD+, Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 2600 nits peak brightness, 120Hz, Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2</p><p>Main display: 10-inch, Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, 1600 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>Main display: 10.2-inch, LTPO OLED, 90Hz, 2232 x 3184 pixels </p><p>Cover display (1/3rd of the main screen): 6.4-inch, LTPO OLED, 90Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Stylus support</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</p></td><td  ><p>Kirin 9020</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>512GB / 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB / 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 10MP telephoto (3x) + 12MP ultra-wide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 40MP ultra-wide + 12MP periscope telephoto (5.5x)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>10MP</p></td><td  ><p>8MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP48</p></td><td  ><p>—</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td><td  ><p><strong>4G only</strong>, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.2, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint sensor (side-mounted), Face unlock</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint sensor (side-mounted), Face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,600 mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,600mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>45W USB-C fast wired charging<br><br>15W wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>66W USB-C fast wired charging</p><p>50W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>Folded: 159.2 x 75 x 12.9 mm</p><p>Unfolded: 159.2 x 214.1 x 3.9 mm</p><p>Weight: 309g</p></td><td  ><p>Folded: 156.7 x 73.5 x 12.8 mm</p><p>Unfolded: 156.7 x 219 x 3.6 mm</p><p>Weight: 298g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Crafted Black</p></td><td  ><p>Red, Black, Purple, White</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Finally, one advantage the Huawei Mate XTs has over the Galaxy Z TriFold is support for stylus input. Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy Z TriFold doesn't support S Pen input, but Huawei sells a separate stylus for the Mate XTs that takes the productivity of the device to another level.</p><p>Speaking of productivity, let's take a look at the software you get on both devices. The Galaxy Z TriFold, as expected, runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-expands-finally-for-galaxy-s25-and-foldables-ai-features-and-enhanced-security">One UI 8</a> out of the box based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16">Android 16</a>, complete with new trifolding-focused features like a standalone DeX mode that turns the foldable into a full computing device for complex tasks.</p><p>In DeX mode on the Galaxy Z TriFold, apps open in windows like on a laptop, and you can also create multiple desktops to keep different windows organized. Samsung also allows you to run three different apps side by side on the Galaxy Z TriFold.</p><p>On the other hand, the Huawei Mate XTs, since it's a China-only device for now, runs on the company's HarmonyOS 5.1. The foldable comes with many productivity features, including stylus support for workspace apps like Docs, OfficeSuite, and Notes. However, as with other Huawei smartphones, it doesn't support Google Play services out of the box.</p><p>This means you can't install apps from the Play Store like you would on the Galaxy Z TriFold and instead have to rely on Huawei's AppGallery for third-party apps.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Huawei Mate XTs: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qcUaGA4nYXrLHJvwUaWZtU" name="huawei-mate-xts-2" alt="Cameras of the Huawei Mate XTs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qcUaGA4nYXrLHJvwUaWZtU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The closest these two foldable phones probably get is in terms of the camera. Both the Huawei Mate XTs and the Galaxy Z TriFold come with a triple-camera system. In fact, the setup on the Galaxy Z TriFold is exactly the same as the one on the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>This means you get a 200MP primary camera with PDAF and OIS, paired with a 10MP telephoto sensor offering up to 3x optical zoom and a 12MP ultrawide sensor with a 120-degree FoV.</p><p>On the Huawei Mate XTs, you get a lower-resolution 50MP primary sensor, but the telephoto camera is a better 12MP unit with up to 5.5x optical zoom clarity. Similarly, the ultrawide sensor on the Mate XTs appears stronger thanks to a 40MP sensor.</p><p>We haven't tested the cameras on both devices yet, but given that the Galaxy Z TriFold uses the same sensors and chipset as the Z Fold 7, we expect similar performance. We also haven't gone hands-on with the Mate XTs, but once we do, we'll share a more detailed look at their camera performance.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts-which-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold vs. Huawei Mate XTs: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KtW8Z2WV35z96i7ZhN7otH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KtW8Z2WV35z96i7ZhN7otH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to choosing between the Galaxy Z TriFold and the Huawei Mate XTs, it's not as simple as picking between two Android flagships. The real challenge isn't just the difference in specs or features, but sheer availability.</p><p>Both phones use extremely new form factors and are very expensive to manufacture, making them difficult to find. The Galaxy Z TriFold is currently launching only in Korea, and even after that, it'll open for sales only in the UAE, China, Taiwan, Singapore, and next year in the U.S.</p><p>Similarly, we don't yet know when the Huawei Mate XTs will be available globally. If Huawei follows the Mate XT's rollout, it'll likely launch in Q1 2026. That said, even if Huawei does bring it to global markets, it won't come to the U.S, and the lack of 5G connectivity and no Google Play services will remain major downsides, likely making the Galaxy Z TriFold a better purchase if both are available in your region.</p><p>It's worth noting that we haven't used either device yet, so the final verdict is still out.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c6e8e0fb-26c4-4163-bfef-a11b68c3645c">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-z-trifold/" data-model-name="Galaxy Z TriFold" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJKygHEi5oBmEN8fNhEH6a.jpg' alt="Product box image of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Samsung</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Galaxy Z TriFold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>First trifolding phone coming to the U.S.</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold isn't available in global markets just yet, but the company has confirmed it'll launch in early 2026.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Is the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold waterproof?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p><strong>Best answer:</strong> The Samsung Galaxy TriFold foldable phone is water-resistant, rated IP48. This denotes some resistance to both dust exposure and water. It isn't as high a dust-resistance rating as you'll find with other premium phones, but the water resistance is in line with most others and relatively impressive for a foldable phone.</p></article></section><h2 id="what-is-an-ip48-rating-2">What is an IP48 rating?</h2><p>The Ingress Protection (IP) rating confirms both dust and water resistance. The first number pertains to dust resistance, and the second to water. Based on the number 4, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/its-official-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-launch">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</a> can withstand exposure to solid objects 1mm or larger. This is not quite as high as other phones that meet the highest 6 rating and can withstand smaller dust particles. But it's typical for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> since the hinge design makes it challenging to avoid damage if dust should get caught inside.</p><p>In terms of water resistance, the 6 represents the phone's ability to be submerged in up to 1.5 meters of fresh water for up to 30 minutes. So, you can dunk it in the bathtub or pool, walk with it in the rain or snow, or even a quick accidental drop in the toilet won't render it dead.</p><p>Keep in mind that any IP rating applies only to freshwater sources, so you should still avoid exposing the phone to saltwater, heavily chlorinated public pools, or high temperatures, such as in a bubble bath, hot tub, or sauna. What's more, you should reconsider bringing it to the beach without a phone pouch since it is not protected against small grains of sand.</p><p>With that said, the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold's water-resistant rating is still impressive. It falls in line with other Samsung foldable phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, as well as foldables from different brands like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr 2025</a>.</p><p>There are some foldable phones that do meet a higher water-resistance rating, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> with an IP68 rating and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> with an IP58 and IP59 rating.</p><p>The uniquely designed Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold opens up on either side to deliver a tablet-sized screen for productivity and entertainment. With this rating, you can take it just about anywhere. Even so, it's advisable to proceed with caution when it comes to water-resistance ratings, as this degrades over time. If you plan to invest in this exciting new concept, grab a protective case once available and limit exposure to water, despite the generous rating. But if it gets wet, fear not. It'll be just fine.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="eecd9931-3610-4ccc-985c-8b0ab65ef4f5">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-z-trifold/" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/isAoL5q4Ju5wkYovSpMZSb.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>It folds two ways</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold smartphone folds out on either side to reveal a large 10-inch, tablet-sized screen.

Samsung may finally let us skip the special cases and get magnetic charging built in.</p><p>A new report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,155380.html" target="_blank">WinFuture</a> says Samsung is working on its own Qi2 magnetic wireless charging dock (model EP-P2900) for the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/-may-not-be-an-s26-pro-either">Galaxy S26 series</a>. This backs up earlier rumors that Samsung is finally giving Galaxy fans what they’ve wanted for years: a real MagSafe-style magnetic charging system for Android.</p><p>Samsung has danced around magnetic accessories for multiple generations of phones. More recently, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-qi2-chargers-in-the-us">introduced Qi2-certified wireless chargers</a>, but not a true standards-based magnetic charging experience built directly into Galaxy hardware. The newly surfaced Qi2 dock suggests that’s about to change.</p><p>Qi2, if you haven’t been keeping track, is the next-gen wireless charging standard that borrows the alignment tech Apple made mainstream.</p><h2 id="shattering-the-15w-speed-barrier-2">Shattering the 15W speed barrier</h2><p>WinFuture’s report points to Samsung’s first-party dock charging at 25W. That immediately sets it apart, because Samsung historically caps its wireless charging speeds at 15W.</p><p>The retailer data indicates this is likely using the newer Qi2.2 standard and is listed in a Dark Gray colorway. This charger is reportedly built to juice up not just the new Galaxy S phones, but also Galaxy Z foldables and even Galaxy Buds, signaling a unified approach to Samsung’s ecosystem.</p><p>This change is bigger than just one accessory. If Samsung adopts Qi2, Android’s biggest brand will finally have a unified magnetic system. Google’s Pixel 10 series recently added built-in magnets, but Galaxy users have needed special "Qi2 Ready" cases. You got magnets, but only if you bought a certain case, which was confusing for most people.</p><p>Before getting too excited about fast wireless charging everywhere, keep in mind there’s a catch. Rumors say only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-series-may-finally-boost-charging-speeds-for-a-faster-user-experience">Galaxy S26 Ultra will get the full 25W wireless charging speed</a>. The standard Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will likely be limited to 20W.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Despite the phone's name, the Galaxy Z TriFold only folds twice, but it packs a massive 10-inch AMOLED display inside with three sections. Although the company revealed the phone's full specs, including a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> processor and the Android 16-based One UI 8, pricing and availability details are a bit more secretive.</p><p>Samsung confirmed the Galaxy Z TriFold will launch in South Korea first on Dec. 12 at 10 a.m. local time, and it will cost roughly 3.59 million won (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/samsung-unveils-first-multi-folding-phone-competition-set-heat-up-2025-12-02/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>), which converts to roughly $2,440.17. However, regional pricing isn't that simple, and the Galaxy Z TriFold will likely cost closer to $3,000 in the U.S. — if the difference between Korean and U.S. pricing for phones like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is any indication.</p><p>It's possible that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/its-official-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-launch">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> could debut in China, Taiwan, Singapore, and the UAE before the end of 2025. However, U.S. customers will have to wait longer to get their hands on the new foldable phone. "Galaxy Z TriFold will be available in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2026 with more details to be shared later," Samsung said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-introducing-galaxy-z-trifold-shape-whats-next-mobile-innovation/" target="_blank">newsroom post</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oJ9KbyNPX4yYyftLXhSvF8" name="Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="Galaxy Z TriFold unveiled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oJ9KbyNPX4yYyftLXhSvF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold may be released in limited quantities in the U.S. The phone will initially be offered "at select retail stores in respective launch countries for hands-on discovery of this exciting new device and in-store assistance," according to the company.

I enjoyed using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-11-review">iQOO 11</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-12-review">iQOO 12</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13</a>, and it was with the iQOO 12 that the Vivo sub-brand really got its act together in terms of the cameras. With the iQOO 15, it isn't changing much — the phone has an even bigger AMOLED panel, a huge 7,000mAh battery, a trio of 50MP rear cameras, and it comes with the latest Qualcomm silicon.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/heres-why-the-poco-f8-ultra-isnt-coming-to-india">POCO fumbling its strategy</a> by not introducing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f8-ultra-review">F8 Ultra</a> in India, iQOO has one less contender to deal with. However, iQOO's positioning this year means the iQOO 15 has increased rivalry from the likes of the Realme GT 8 Pro. While iQOO did a good job maintaining roughly the same price over the last three generations, the iQOO 15 gets a significant price hike this time around.</p><p>That makes the phone not as good a value against its predecessors, and pits it against phones with better camera systems. Does it still make sense to consider the phone?

That's for the 12GB/256GB variant, and the 16GB/512GB model costs ₹79,999 ($888) in the country. To put that into context, the iQOO 13 debuted at ₹54,999 ($610) for the 12GB/256GB configuration, and ₹59,999 ($665) for the 16GB/512GB model.</p><p>I don't really understand what iQOO is thinking this year; we just don't see such a drastic price hike, and in doing so, it effectively killed any early interest in the device — particularly with the iQOO 13 still available in the country.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-iqoo-15-doesn-t-stand-out-as-much"><span>iQOO 15 doesn't stand out as much</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cVHbjCdnDe4wJBpueZxAje" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cVHbjCdnDe4wJBpueZxAje.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've always enjoyed using iQOO phones because of the brand's ostentatious designs, but I just don't see that from the iQOO 15. The brand doesn't have a model that stands out this year, and the black color variant I'm using is so it dull it may have been a OnePlus phone.</p><p>There isn't anything to indicate that you're using a high-end phone, and the iQOO 15 just doesn't convey a sense of excitement. That's what I look for in a new phone, and the POCO F8 Ultra does this really well thanks to the new denim texture. The iQOO 15, on the other hand, just feels like a giant slab of a phone with about as much character as boiled lettuce.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4435px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="xFox9c7mf9sTnCGqpqWzSe" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xFox9c7mf9sTnCGqpqWzSe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4435" height="2498" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4435px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="EqUviqLdKsCVoYJYgoEHSe" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EqUviqLdKsCVoYJYgoEHSe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4435" height="2498" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3AGitQEusCWuDSx3LFYGZe" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3AGitQEusCWuDSx3LFYGZe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4506px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="QLBjZxxSzTtHTT6ityQ7Ve" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QLBjZxxSzTtHTT6ityQ7Ve.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4506" height="2538" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The phone has a fiberglass rear and aluminum mid-frame, and it is on the bigger side thanks to the 6.85-inch panel. It is also heavier at 216g, and that's down to the 7,000mAh battery. Weight distribution is decent enough, but it isn't the most comfortable to hold or use. Thankfully, iQOO retained IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance, and the ultrasonic sensor does a good job with authentication.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-this-is-a-true-powerhouse"><span>This is a true powerhouse</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="C7cfpJ7tpWYRqVBtB3oKie" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C7cfpJ7tpWYRqVBtB3oKie.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike other brands, iQOO is still using a 2K (3168 x 1440) panel, and the 6.85-inch AMOLED is one of the biggest in this category. It has bright colors, excellent brightness levels, and does a great job with Dolby Vision and HDR content in general. While iQOO advertises this as a 144Hz panel, it only switches to the higher resolution in select situations, and in most daily usage tasks, you'll get the same 120Hz as most other phones today.</p><p>The phone does a good job while gaming as well, and although the stereo sound isn't that loud or detailed — the F8 Ultra blows it out of the water — it is serviceable. Annoyingly, iQOO limits popular titles like Call of Duty and PUBG to 60fps, so although these games can hit 120fps on other phones, you don't get that on the device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Kcdf4Q8t2LcuFPCk8WbSZe" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kcdf4Q8t2LcuFPCk8WbSZe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a similar vein, the iQOO 15 isn't quite as good with sustained performance. It handles demanding games without any hassle, but there is noticeable throttling with extended use, and it overheats — similar to all other Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 devices I tested. This is more to do with Qualcomm than iQOO, and although the phone has a bigger vapor cooling system this year, it still crossed 52 degrees in synthetic tests, and got uncomfortably hot in extended gaming scenarios.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KKSZkW8qxcPBY23RqtVCfe" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KKSZkW8qxcPBY23RqtVCfe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rest of the hardware is quite decent; the phone gets LPDDR5X RAM and UFS 4.1 storage modules, and the 16GB/512GB model I've been using didn't have any slowdowns or lag. The vibration motor is much better this generation, and I didn't run into any issues with connectivity.</p><p>Thanks to the 7,000mAh silicon battery, the iQOO 15 easily lasts a day and a half, and you can get it to last two days with regular use. The phone gets 100W charging tech, and it takes just under an hour to charge.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-you-get-great-cameras-with-the-iqoo-15"><span>You get great cameras with the iQOO 15</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="aZWpzzw7zhjhpPPMAR4EXe" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZWpzzw7zhjhpPPMAR4EXe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4400" height="2478" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the cameras, the iQOO 15 gets a 50MP Sony IMX921 main camera, alongside a 50MP Sony IMX881 tele lens with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and a 50MP Samsung JN1 wide-angle lens. There's a 32MP GalaxyCore GC32 selfie camera, and it gets 4K60 video.</p><p>The main camera and tele lenses do a great job (as you'd imagine), and the phone benefits from Vivo's tuning. I have no issues with the quality of the photos; the phone consistently delivered great shots in challenging shooting conditions, and the tele lens doubles as a portrait shooter.</p><div

good. It still produces decent photos, but you don't quite get the same quality, and that's down to the sensor of choice. Samsung's JN1 is starting to show its age, and other brands have switched to newer modules that are much better. Clearly, Vivo either had sensors left over and pulled a Samsung, or it decided to save costs by using the older module.</p><p>Regardless, the other two cameras on the iQOO 15 are great, and it does a good job against the POCO F8 Ultra and Galaxy S25.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-iqoo-15-has-better-software-this-year"><span>iQOO 15 has better software this year</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4975px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="2XE55DpHSzGUDzybbw7Rae" name="iQOO 15" alt="iQOO 15 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2XE55DpHSzGUDzybbw7Rae.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4975" height="2802" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iQOO 15 comes with OriginOS 6 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>, and it is identical to what you get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">Vivo X300 Pro</a> and X300.

It isn't as clear-cut a choice as previous years because of the price hike, but I still believe the iQOO 15 is positioned well in the Indian market. Its cameras may not beat the Realme GT 8 Pro or the regular Vivo X300 and Find X9, but it is a legitimate rival, and the fact that POCO didn't launch the F8 Ultra in the country makes things easier for the Vivo sub-brand.</p><p>I'd still recommend getting the iQOO 13; its cameras are good, and the hardware isn't slow by any measure. The iQOO 15 is a definite upgrade, but it misses out on being anywhere as good a value as its predecessor.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The report cites an internal memo from Maher Saba, who is the vice president of Meta's Reality Labs Foundation. It reveals that Meta's next-generation pair of mixed-reality glasses will now release in 2027 instead of 2026. Plus, there's reportedly a prototype wearable and a new Quest headset in the works.</p><p>The company originally planned to launch the mixed-reality glasses, code-named "Phoenix," in the second half of 2026. Now, the glasses are positioned for a release in the first half of 2027. The minor delay is intended to give Meta "a lot more breathing room to get the details right," according to a separate memo seen by Business Insider.</p><p>"There's a lot coming in hot with tight bring-up schedules and big changes to our core UX, and we won't compromise on landing a fully polished and reliable experience," wrote Metaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns, per the report.</p><p>Separately, the memo penned by Saba references a "limited edition" wearable variant code-named "Malibu 2" in 2026. The next Meta Quest headset will also be a "large upgrade" that will "significantly improve unit economics," according to Aul and Cairns.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ziW89zHd2rsXrWAq7HBM6k" name="meta-quest-3s-apple-iphone-17-pro-max-orange" alt="A Meta Quest 3S headset behind an orange iPhone 17 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ziW89zHd2rsXrWAq7HBM6k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the memos don't reference the situation specifically, it sounds like these delays may be in relation to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-just-stole-two-of-apples-biggest-lead-designers-and-the-implications-for-vr-smart-glasses-and-ai-are-absolutely-enormous">Meta's design leadership change</a> announced this week.

The update initially debuted for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Nothing Phone 3</a>, and later <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3a-just-got-android-16-proving-budget-phones-dont-have-to-wait">made its way to older Nothing Phone models</a> by Nov. 28. However, Nothing Phone users have reported bugs with Nothing OS 4, and the launch has been rocky. In fact, it looks like Nothing has paused the Nothing OS 4 rollout entirely as it works to fix some of the update's issues.</p><p>The first sign that Nothing OS 4's rollout may have been halted came on Dec. 1, when a  report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techiboy.com/nothing-os-4-0-stable-update-disappears-for-some-users-heres-what-happened/" target="_blank">Techiboy</a> noted that the update appeared to disappear from user devices. Now, a post from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NothingTech/comments/1pfkgtq/nothing_os_40_rollout_has_been_paused/" target="_blank">u/nikhkin on Reddit</a> claims that the Nothing OS 4 release was indeed paused. The post cites a screenshotted email from Nothing's support team  responding to the customer's inquiry into why their Nothing Phone 3 hadn't received the Android 16 update yet.</p><p>"We have received feedback from the relevant team and we ... regret to inform you we have temporarily halted and removed the current 4.0 rollout and are working on an urgent fix," the screenshotted email, claimed to be from a Nothing support representative, explained.
