Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Meta has been amping up efforts to give users control over conversations on Threads. It announced two new tools today (Oct.29) to help you keep the comment section clean, on track, rather than having unnecessary trolls take over your post.</p><p>First up is "reply approvals," while this will need more intervention from you, it will help keep things as civil as possible in your Threads posts.  Users will not be able to choose which replies appear publicly, even before the comment gets linked to your post for the world to see. Users will see a list of comments waiting for your approval within the app, so that they show up on your Thread.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FD8WC4a6fhV3GYUzdtKwVK" name="Threads-Reply-approvals" alt="Meta announces ways to tackle trolls on Threads" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FD8WC4a6fhV3GYUzdtKwVK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Each reply can be approved or ignored individually. For efficiency, users can also do so with all pending replies at once, whether it's designating them as acceptable or all spam. You can also toggle on or off approvals for individual posts and review replies at your own pace.</p><p>Meta is also expanding ways you can filter your activity feed. Users can now filter replies to see "people they follow" or those with mentions. This makes it easier to keep track of relevant conversations, especially for high-activity influencer or business accounts. "This way, you can surface the replies you care about most and focus on the discussions you’re interested in," the company added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AnzQUBv222jcjqwGHZhKVK" name="Threads-Reply-approvals" alt="Meta announces ways to tackle trolls on Threads" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AnzQUBv222jcjqwGHZhKVK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These tools make their way along with the recently announced "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/threads-adds-vanishing-ghost-posts-on-a-timer-for-those-one-off-hot-takes">ghost posts</a>" feature, which gives users the ability to designate a certain thread as a "ghost post," making it vanish within 24 hours. Meta states this is something users can use as a way to be "unfiltered" and post "fresh takes/thoughts" without "the pressure of permanence or polish."</p><p>Additionally, Threads rolled out another update that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/threads-is-rolling-out-group-chats-and-expands-messaging-to-the-eu">brought group chat support</a> to the app, which allows people to engage in group chats with up to 50 people. It also provides the option to customize your chat name while it prepares invite links for more people. Messaging others on Threads now also supports photos, videos, GIFs, and stickers, as well as "smart" privacy options.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The domed Actua 360 display is a more natural design progression, while also stretching the touchscreen to the edge, removing the wasted border space I hated on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Watch 2</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2821px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="FXcXVPbs57i2sCnpcy8vjM" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-concentric-watch-face" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 sitting on a cloth chair cushion, showing the Concentric watch face with white hour, minute, and second numbers extending to the edge of the domed display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FXcXVPbs57i2sCnpcy8vjM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2821" height="1587" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You'll need time to adjust to the domed display, which embellishes the Wear OS 6 effect of magnifying centered content.  It's certainly helpful for making notifications and Tiles more readable, but you don't usually see <em>warping</em> like this on a display, and the dome adds slight resistance to left-right swipes.</p><p>I can't predict whether <em>you</em> will like the display. My coworkers who've seen it for themselves either think it's the "best looking display" on any smartwatch or it's a weird distraction. But you won't know until you get your hands on it.</p><p>In my case, it's grown on me, with the display's vivid brightness and smooth scrolling improving the experience. In particular, Google's 1.49-inch 45mm model looks more natural than before, and I appreciate how Wear OS reflows content to leverage that extra space.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="f8sYvBcngybvkjfZtvbM59" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-repair-screw-2" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 45mm case held in hand, with the bands removed, exposing a slot where a screw is visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f8sYvBcngybvkjfZtvbM59.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3640" height="2047" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another important upgrade is how Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/why-pixel-watch-4-repairability-is-such-a-big-deal">made the Watch 4 fully repairable</a>.

The deal ends on January 7th, however, so don't wait too long to make your move.</p><p>This offer is similar to a promotion that T-Mobile 5G Home Internet ran earlier this year, and it was clearly popular enough that the company decided to resurrect it one last time. T-Mobile 5G Home Internet is often recommended among the staff here at Android Central because it's fast, affordable, and comes with loads of useful perks. Bundle the internet with one of the T-Mo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">mobile plans</a>, and you might even be eligible for additional savings.

Upgrade to a better plan, such as T-Mobile 5G Amplified or All-In Home Internet, and you'll also get perks like "Advanced Cyber Security", a Mesh Wi-Fi extender, and even free subscriptions to Hulu and Paramount Plus!</p><p>The All-In plan is the provider's most expensive offering, and that's how you get the 300 bucks, but the Rely and Amplified plans still land you $100 and $200, respectively. All-In starts at $75 per month but can be dropped to as little as $55 per month when you bundle with mobile, while the Rely and Amplified plans can be knocked down to as little as $35 and $45 if you play your cards right. </p><p>Needless to say, 5G Home Internet will never be as fast as fiber, but if you're already a T-Mobile user and you're looking for a good deal on internet, this is an unmissable opportunity. Just be aware that the free gift card expires after six months, so don't wait too long to redeem that sweet, sweet Mastercard cash. Fortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> shopping season is just around the corner. </p> ]]></dc:content>

According to Vats, Samsung has pushed an update for its internal test that supposedly makes the Quick Settings menu icons "pop." Samsung has included a soft, black border around the menu's icons that only serves to bring them off the screen a little bit.</p><p>While Samsung's current One UI 8 Quick Settings (and UI in general) is quite clean, one could make the argument that it doesn't pop. It assumes that blurred, clean aesthetic across its entirety, but this small update tries to breathe separation into the equation.</p><p>From what Vats discovered, the pop is just for the toggleable icons, as the containers for the icons are still blurred. Even the sliders remain pretty much the same as what we currently have with v8.0. All in all, the small change gives us <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">Apple Liquid Glass</a> vibes, just with how one little change provides that pop of separation.</p><h2 id="still-on-the-outside-looking-in-2">Still on the outside looking in</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive 🔥One UI 8.5 YJO now adds outline design to toggles in the Quick Panel 👀✨A small change — but it makes the whole panel look cleaner and more polished! pic.twitter.com/yJwjr1UXWp<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1983778188611481856">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>It might hurt being on the outside looking in, but it looks like that might be the case for a while, as reports claim Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-reportedly-delayed">had to delay its One UI 8.5 beta</a>. Original rumors said we might see a beta program kickoff in November, but things have changed, as tipsters now claim that's "unlikely." Nothing's for certain now as to why the company pushed it back, but there's some speculation that it could have to do with its uncertain Galaxy S26 series lineup.</p><p>Specifically, recent reports claim that Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">dropped its Galaxy S26 Edge</a> in favor of returning the S26 Plus to the equation next year. There are also rumors that the S26 series could launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-release-date">later next year</a>, maybe as late as March.</p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-could-finally-match-google-pixel-update-pace-with-one-ui-8-5">reports speculate</a> that Samsung could be moving into a world where it matches Google's update cadence and bring Android to its Galaxy users faster. A few firmware leaks suggest Samsung could shift into quarterly Android updates for Galaxy phones, marking a distinct change, as it typically forgoes such patches.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This "richer" experience Samsung highlights is brought in part by its recent AI enhancements. Samsung Internet's "ambient" AI is said to be "integrated" with the user, much like what you'd find on your handheld device.</p><p>The browser's AI can be personalized to ensure that your specific browsing behavior remains unique to you.</p><p>Aside from this, Samsung touts two major gamechangers with its Internet browser's PC beta: full Galaxy integration and security. Starting with the former, users can synchronize their browsing history, bookmarks, and more between their PC and mobile devices. Through Samsung Pass, your autofilled credentials are right there when you need them. Additionally, those AI features, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/every-android-flagship-should-steal-this-ai-feature-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Browsing Assist</a>, bring webpage translations and summaries.</p><p>Users can also begin browsing a page on their phone and then quickly pick it up on their PC.</p><p>Elsewhere, Samsung highlights "smart anti-tracking." The browser's PC beta brings a feature that "helps block third-party web tracker attempts to collect personal information." The included Privacy Dashboard reportedly gives users a bird's eye view of their online defenses.</p><h2 id="connecting-the-galaxy-like-constellations-2">Connecting the Galaxy, like Constellations</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.10%;"><img id="SLMzKZfmASQtnhSwfLMrZd" name="samsung-internet-on-pc-browsing-data-info" alt="Samsung Internet on PC beta kicks off, enabling users to merge their browsing experiences across their mobile devices and computers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SLMzKZfmASQtnhSwfLMrZd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="521" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're looking to connect your Samsung Internet browsing across devices, you must sign in to your Samsung account beforehand. Beginning today (Oct 30), the post states the Samsung Internet on PC beta is rolling out for Windows 11 and 10 computers in the U.S. and South Korea. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.samsung.com/beta">official beta program</a> sign-up page is live right now, so you can hop in.</p><p>Samsung states that it plans to bring this beta to more areas in the future.</p><p>When we started getting our hands on the Galaxy S25 series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/every-android-flagship-should-steal-this-ai-feature-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung's AI features</a> were a pretty unavoidable highlight, namely because of their privacy. Browsing Assist was among those standouts, as the feature in Samsung Internet could summarize webpages for you in a blink, getting you the info you need faster. However, another key detail was that Galaxy S25 users could have their phone conduct its AI processes completely on-device, instead of reaching for the cloud.</p><p>It's a route that would be nice if Google and Apple made, too, but at least there's one option out there with a choice. Essentially, many of the company's "Assist" features can run entirely on-device, but if you're looking for help with your photos, that'll leave your phone looking for help.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The release of the Galaxy S26 is still a few months away, but I just uncovered a Boost Mobile deal that could you the upcoming flagship for completely free if you play your cards right. The carrier's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.boostmobile.com/plans/infinite-access-for-galaxy"><strong>Infinite Access for Galaxy plan starts at $65 per month and guarantees you $800 off a new Samsung phone upgrade every year indefinitely,</strong></a> not to mention unlimited talk, text, data, international benefits and more.</p><p>Considering that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> is likely to retail for $800, this plan should cover the full price of the phone, and I'm talking about a device that hasn't even been announced yet. </p><p>That said, there is a pretty significant catch. If you take advantage of the deal <em>today</em>, you'll get a free <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> - since that's the current model - but you'll need to hold on to that phone for 12 months before you can claim your free upgrade to the S26. </p><p>Alternatively, you could simply wait until the Galaxy S26 is revealed (presumably) in January to sign up for Boost Mobile's Infinite Access plan, which will guarantee you the new phone instantly. The choice is yours, but either way you're getting a future full of free Galaxy upgrades and a great wireless plan to boot, which is nothing to scoff at. </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="67dd7ee2-4dbb-4686-91cb-dfa7205a287f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile" data-dimension48="Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile" href="https://www.boostmobile.com/plans/infinite-access-for-galaxy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="3yYJ8LxAAtvrYDygDsL6GQ" name="boost-mobile-logo-dish-reco.png" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3yYJ8LxAAtvrYDygDsL6GQ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.boostmobile.com/plans/infinite-access-for-galaxy" data-dimension112="67dd7ee2-4dbb-4686-91cb-dfa7205a287f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile" data-dimension48="Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile" data-dimension25=""><strong>Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile</strong></a></p><p>Sign up for Boost Mobile's Infinite Access for Galaxy Plan ($65 per month) and you'll be guaranteed $800 off the latest <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> <em>every year </em>you have the plan. </p><p>Both Z and S series devices are eligible, which means you can claim a free Galaxy S25 today (or wait until the Galaxy S26 is announced in a couple of months).

That means you don't have to worry about which apps are made specifically for the headset; just find all your favorites on the Google Play Store and do what you love!</p><p>On the flipside, the Galaxy XR isn't sold as a gaming console the way the Meta Quest is, despite the optional controllers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/high-demand-wipes-out-galaxy-xr-controllers-hours-after-launch">selling out in no time flat</a>.

The Meta Quest 3 is mainly designed to fit cost restraints, so it can be under $500. That includes shipping with a relatively uncomfortable cloth strap for your head and an all-plastic design.</p><p>Samsung Galaxy XR, previously known as Project Moohan, has a far more premium look and feel. While some parts are plastic to keep weight down, it looks a lot more like a Meta Quest Pro than a Meta Quest 3. This includes rigid side straps with a wheel on the back for quickly adjusting size, a large, plush pad for the back of your head, and another large plush pad for your forehead.</p><p>Unlike the Meta Quest 3, Galaxy XR doesn't put any weight on your face at all. The rubber light blockers are included in the box and magnetically removable, so you'll feel no pressure on your face while wearing the headset for long periods of time.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2CeenrvW4GFy8T8Y8tncdn" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2CeenrvW4GFy8T8Y8tncdn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AjkRtN6tMb3KfycbnaeemL" name="Galaxy-XR-Side-Profile" alt="side profile of the Galaxy XR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AjkRtN6tMb3KfycbnaeemL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3938" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="B4MnhY68yWPKyJo82LRQ2N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-top-down-on-books" alt="A top-down photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset sitting on a pile of books." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B4MnhY68yWPKyJo82LRQ2N.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tPv9K5mz3qhZKHXHrPF4vM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-back-to-front" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset sitting on a pile of books, angled away to show the lenses and back knob." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tPv9K5mz3qhZKHXHrPF4vM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The Meta Quest 3's default cloth strap distributes weight on your face and around the sides and back of your head.

Similarly, Android XR, which powers Galaxy XR, is also a specific version of Android built for XR devices. While they sound similar on the surface, there are some key differences to consider.</p><p>While both are based on the Android Open Source Project, Meta Horizon OS features significant layers of customization that Meta has built over the past decade. Meta has built so much on top of Android that it actually packages it as a "separate" operating system, calling it Meta Horizon OS, and now offers it as an option for third-party companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">to build their own headsets on</a>.</p><p>Meta Horizon OS not only revolves around the "Meta Horizon experience," which includes promoting the Meta Horizon metaverse app front and center, but also ties Meta services deeply into the OS. Apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram all have native Horizon OS apps, and while a few other apps can be downloaded on the app store, Meta Quest headsets are still mainly gaming consoles with some extra computing functionality.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF" name="android-xr-video-player-ui" alt="A look at the video player UI of Android XR running on a Samsung Project Moohan headset in mixed reality" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Android XR is a more visually polished OS </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android XR is built upon the Android Open Source Project as well but, like most builds of Android, Google services are at the center.

That means developers don't need to do anything extra to get their apps in XR, although they can choose to build new XR-specific versions for the headset.</p><p>That's a massive leg-up on Meta, which has struggled to get developers to port apps to its Meta Horizon OS. While there are a handful of 2D apps on the Meta Quest — mostly communication apps — Galaxy XR can run any app your Android-based smartphone or tablet can run. That's an incredible boon for everyday use and ensures Galaxy XR is the ultimate XR productivity device.</p><p>If you want to learn more about how both operating systems compare, see our detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os">Android XR vs Meta Horizon OS</a> comparison.</p><h2 id="samsung-xr-vs-meta-quest-3-performance-and-specs-2">Samsung XR vs. Meta Quest 3: Performance and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NitxdTKiUJCdu8inq98q9k" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-gen-2-chip-01.jpg" alt="A placard for the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 SoC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NitxdTKiUJCdu8inq98q9k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets power the Meta Quest 3 and Samsung Galaxy XR, but Galaxy XR features the more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2</a>.

This is quickly followed by "Stop using it and get it looked at." Ever wonder why it happens or what's so dangerous about it?</p><p>Hydrogen. It's what causes the swelling, and when hydrogen — a volatile, highly flammable gas — is anywhere near a potential ignition source, some very, <em><strong>very</strong></em> bad things can happen.</p><p>It's not normal, even if it is fairly common, and a lot of tech goes into trying to prevent it. Here's what you need to know about it.</p><h2 id="where-does-the-hydrogen-come-from-2">Where does the hydrogen come from?</h2><p>The batteries used in everything from phones to laptops to electric cars are based on similar technology, with lithium as a common ingredient. This is great because these types of batteries have a relatively large capacity for their size, a fairly long lifespan, and can deliver plenty of power.</p><p>Lithium has another property that's not as good: it can emit hydrogen gas under certain conditions. When combined with the construction of the battery used in things like phones, a battery can turn into a puffy, spicy pillow because it swells.</p><p>I'm going to use a phone battery as an example, but the same applies to the batteries in your smartwatch, smart ring, tablet, and laptop. Common things tech enthusiasts all seem to have.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">battery in your phone</a> is basically a thermoplastic foil pouch. It has a shape because of the components inside it, which divide cells or act as electrodes, but it's still just a foil pouch made of very thin, flexible material. It's also sealed very well, though some batteries, like the behemoths used in EVs,  will have a one-way valve to prevent gas build-up inside this foil casing.</p><p>When you "mistreat" the battery, the lithium produces hydrogen gas as a byproduct. Hydrogen is made of very small particles and will escape through the tiniest of openings most of the time. But a sealed battery — one without a gas escape valve — is usually well sealed enough to prevent gas from escaping.</p><p>When you pump gas into a flexible container and have no way to use it, it builds up. It will eventually cause the foil to stretch and balloon up, often enough to separate a phone's body or even crack the screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="k9owTBaAMjmxoc4MQe8nfg" name="lg-g5-battery-5.jpg" alt="LG G5 battery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9owTBaAMjmxoc4MQe8nfg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I said "mistreat" earlier. It's not hard to force hydrogen release because batteries can be sensitive to external factors. That sounds like doublespeak, but if everything was working properly and the battery stayed under optimal conditions all of the time, it wouldn't happen. What causes it to happen?</p><p><strong>Overcharging, undercharging, and overheating</strong> can all lead to a swollen battery. Plenty of safeguards are in place to try to prevent this, but we still find ways to do it.</p><p><strong>Physical damage</strong> will almost certainly cause it to happen. A battery is designed as a precision component where everything has a place. If something happens that damages the construction or placement of a battery's internals, swelling can result.</p><p>An <strong>internal short circuit</strong> can cause battery swelling, and there's an easy way to trigger one: charging a battery when it's too cold. <strong>Never</strong> charge or store your battery where the temperature is below freezing. In fact, it's a good practice to not even use a device with a lithium battery when it's too cold.</p><p>Yes, you should try to be careful of how you treat your battery. They can be dangerous if used improperly, and a battery swollen with hydrogen gas only needs a spark for everything to become very dangerous.</p><p>This is why we're told to stop using any electronic device with an obviously swollen battery. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-what-makes-a-phone-battery-go-haywire-and-explode">Thermal runaway</a> combined with an explosive gas is bad news.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-do-to-prevent-it-2">What can you do to prevent it?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tZ2LxE7BeEukX8Jjhw4BwT" name="best-usb-c-cables-hero-2022.jpg" alt="USB-C Cables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZ2LxE7BeEukX8Jjhw4BwT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Thankfully, this is fairly easy to mitigate. Something out of your control can happen, naturally, but the biggest issues come from "mistreating" the battery. Notice I don't list old age as a reason for battery swelling; a battery getting old is more susceptible to thermal and charging issues, but age won't cause a lithium battery to emit hydrogen on its own.</p><p>Always charge your battery with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">proper charger and cable</a>. If your new gadget doesn't come with a cable or plug, the papers that were in the box or available online will tell you what those are.</p><p>Try to limit your gadget use when and where it's bitterly cold. Batteries hate heat and cold equally.</p><p><strong>Never</strong> charge your battery where it's below freezing. <strong>Ever</strong>. This is almost a guarantee that you'll create shorts inside the assembly, and it can be a major factor for a swollen battery.</p><p>Of course, if your battery is noticeably swollen, power the device off and let it sit somewhere safe for at least a few hours (because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/what-is-hysteresis-an-introduction-for-electrical-engineers/" target="_blank">a phenomenon called hysteresis</a>) so the current can stop flowing. Then take it to someone who can open the device and have a look.

This display uses a holographic waveguide that's visible to the glasses wearer but not to anyone looking from the outside. They have a limited field of view and are primarily used to display notifications, turn-by-turn directions, music playback controls, and other features you might be accustomed to seeing on a smartwatch.</p><p>So far, Google has only shown off glasses that use Gemini voice controls to navigate on the device. That means you need to say "Hey, Google" any time you want to do anything on the glasses. It's a great way to interact while driving or when both of your hands are busy, but it's not ideal for any situation with lots of background noise or when you need to be quiet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ" name="Android-XR-Maps-2" alt="A still from an Android XR example video of how the software will work on smart glasses, showing someone navigating city streets with Google Maps, with a map view holograph showing when to turn." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Cameras mounted on each side can capture photos and record video, giving you a hands-free camera that can be activated in a split second. That can be particularly useful when you're trying to capture something funny your kids or pets are doing, for instance, while a phone takes much longer to pull out of your pocket, launch the camera, and hit record.</p><p>Samsung's glasses will almost certainly be entirely reliant on your phone, similar to a Bluetooth-only smartwatch. The glasses will have some local functionality — capturing photos and video, and maybe locally stored music playback — but they aren't designed to replace your phone. At best, I expect them to be priced slightly lower than Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses, since they won't be able to do as much with voice-only input.</p><p>Essentially, I expect these glasses to operate almost identically to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2</a>, albeit with a display that can visually show you Gemini's feedback and notifications. That visual component could make all the difference to some people, though, as even a camera viewfinder on the display could make it significantly easier to frame your photo or video like you want.</p><p>And I also expect Samsung to launch glasses without this in-lens display, allowing for more affordable options.</p><h2 id="what-it-won-t-be-2">What it won't be</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vvq8PFe5YLqu8t8Hf6AJG6" name="meta-project-orion-ar-glasses-hands-on-ui-02.jpg" alt="A view of the multitasking UI inside Meta Orion AR Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vvq8PFe5YLqu8t8Hf6AJG6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The screenshot you see above is what I saw when demoing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> at Meta Connect 2024. Meta Orion is a pair of smart glasses that feels more like a full "face computer" in a compact form factor. In essence, it's a VR headset without the bulk or immersive mode.</p><p>Samsung's smart glasses will <em>not</em> be a Meta Orion competitor. Not yet, at least. They won't replace your phone, and they likely won't play games or do anything more than you might use your smartwatch for. They're effectively a nice wearable camera with an AI assistant attached that can also make phone calls and display notifications. A way to stop looking at your phone so darn often.</p><p>Warby Parker and Gentle Monster smart glasses made by Samsung almost certainly won't have the ability to track the space around you like a VR headset (or Meta Orion) can, meaning they won't be able to use that in-lens display to overlay virtual imagery on the real world. There's also no evidence showing that Google or Samsung has any sort of input device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">Meta Neural Band</a>. This is a voice-only experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="nDxHrvU7jviWKhmBLDpr6Y" name="Meta-orion-ar-glasses-press-photo-1.jpg" alt="Press photo of a woman wearing the Meta Project Orion AR glasses and using the multitasking software." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nDxHrvU7jviWKhmBLDpr6Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Because of this, they also <strong>won't</strong> be terribly expensive. Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses are <em>only</em> $799 because they cut out a lot of the uber-expensive components that make Meta Orion as capable as it is, and the inclusion of the Meta Neural Band in the box only adds to that cost. If I'm being hopeful, Samsung's display glasses should come in at less than $799.</p><p>If we've learned anything about Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, smart glasses without a display likely won't cost much more than a standard pair of designer-brand frames with lenses, making them a reasonable option for glasses wearers who want more out of their daily specs.</p><p>Despite both of these types of glasses running Android XR, I don't expect to see them running full Android apps. Almost certainly, Android XR on smart glasses will operate like a cut-down version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS</a>, relying on companion apps or smartphone app connectivity to do all the heavy lifting.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CxtFHvkRCkCFErjk2GCwn7" name="magicleap-google-android-xr-smart-glasses-navigation" alt="Magic Leap Android XR smart glasses as seen at FII 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CxtFHvkRCkCFErjk2GCwn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Magic Leap)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even without full apps running on the display, I can guarantee these will still be an impressive experience that'll augment your everyday life. Whether that's being a tourist and asking Gemini about what you're seeing in a foreign country (see the above image), or asking it how to improve your golf swing, there's a very real reason these will become the next big thing in tech.</p><p>That's going to be especially true if Google and Samsung end up getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">the "remember" feature from demos</a> working on the final product.

Now, the smartphone is generally available for $899 and runs the privacy-focused /e/OS.</p><p>It's the follow-up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-launch">Fairphone 5</a>, which debuted in 2023, and is the fourth Fairphone made in partnership with Murena. You might know the company as the maker of /e/OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wonder-what-life-is-like-without-google-or-apple-you-need-to-try-this-alternative">an Android fork that provides a "deGoogled" experience</a> for users. The operating system retains only what is needed, cutting out data collection at the system level. It also adds custom, tracker-free Mail and Calendar apps, plus the Murena Workspace for business and cloud needs.</p><p>The private software experience from Murena combines with Fairphone's repairable electronics design in an effort to offer users "an ethical smartphone," according to the news release. Fairphone 6 is made to be repairable, packing a modular design with parts that can be replaced with a single screwdriver. The repairable smartphone comes with five years of warranty, too.</p><p>On the hardware side, you get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip</a> and a 4,415mAh battery. Despite offering a larger capacity, the Fairphone 6 battery is smaller than the one used in the Fairphone 5, and costs less than $50 to replace. There's a primary 50MP main camera paired with a 13MP ultrawide lens for all your photography needs.</p><p>The Fairphone 6 comes with 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage as standard, but there's a microSD card slot for future expansion. The display panel is a 6.31-inch OLED covered with Gorilla Glass 7i.</p><h2 id="why-you-might-want-to-buy-a-fairphone-6-2">Why you might want to buy a Fairphone 6</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rLdnBXvAf3VCzncqtrQGs8" name="Murena-Fairphone-Gen-6-02" alt="Fairphone (Gen 6)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rLdnBXvAf3VCzncqtrQGs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the $899 price tag for the Fairphone 6 is hefty, especially when you consider that you're paying flagship rates for a phone with midrange specs. The value proposition is much more than what you get on paper, though. The Fairphone 6's privacy-first nature and repairability, which includes 12 easily-repairable parts, are what makes it an attractive option — even for the price.</p><p>Building a private, sustainable, and repairable Android smartphone isn't cheap, so you'll be paying a premium for that if you choose to buy the Fairphone 6. However, there are some that will gladly pay more for a repairable phone without unnecessary Google apps or services.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Even today, many creators still upload only in 1080p. For those pixel peepers out there, Google is now rolling out a new YouTube feature that automatically upscales low-resolution videos to higher resolutions.</p><p>For now, YouTube has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-features-to-help-creators/">announced</a> that it will begin upscaling videos uploaded below 1080p from SD to HD resolution. Later, the company plans to upscale videos to 4K. Videos enhanced using YouTube's AI will be clearly marked as "Super resolution" to indicate upscaling.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WJdHtcsKeskArfWqZYVQ4X" name="youtube-ai-upscale" alt="Super Resolution upscaling in YouTube" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WJdHtcsKeskArfWqZYVQ4X.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube also notes that both creators and viewers will be able to opt out if they prefer not to watch upscaled content. The company will keep the original files and resolutions intact.</p><p>It was initially reported that these upscaled videos would be available only on the YouTube app for TVs, but the company confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chriswelch/status/1983609075599601934">Bloomberg's Chris Welch</a> that the feature is coming to all YouTube platforms, including smartphones and web, alongside TVs.</p><h2 id="ai-upscaling-is-coming-to-youtube-across-all-devices-2">AI upscaling is coming to YouTube across all devices</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jZ3GketsjadpT2N5UW8QYj" name="youtube-immersive-preview-homescreen" alt="Immersive previews on YouTube for smart TVs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZ3GketsjadpT2N5UW8QYj.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For TVs, YouTube is also adding some nice tweaks to enhance the experience. Viewers will now see a more "immersive preview" when browsing channels on the home page. Additionally, YouTube is rolling out "contextual search on TVs," so when a viewer searches from a creator's channel page, videos from that channel will be prioritized at the top of results instead of getting buried among other content.</p><p>Another upgrade for creators is an increased file size limit for thumbnails. Previously, the cap was 2MB, but it has now been raised to 50MB, meaning you'll soon start seeing more detailed thumbnails from your favorite creators.</p><p>YouTube says the changes have started rolling out, and you should be able to see them on your screens soon.

It meets the usual IP68 certification for both dust and water resistance, as well as IP66, IP69, and IP69K, which confirms resistance to higher temperatures and high-pressure water jets as well. With that said, there are still precautions you should take when using it near or even in water.</p></article></section><h2 id="everything-to-know-about-the-oneplus-15-s-water-resistance-rating-2">Everything to know about the OnePlus 15's water resistance rating</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.82%;"><img id="Uk6LMmYu2uwJdwmBXcWHK8" name="oneplus-15-camera-module-look" alt="First look at the OnePlus 15's back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uk6LMmYu2uwJdwmBXcWHK8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2655" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-new-oneplus-15-launches-in-china">launched in China</a> and is coming to North America soon. Like its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, the phone boasts both an IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance rating. The IP68 rating confirms that it's dust-tight, able to withstand exposure to even small dust particles. It also signifies protection against water submersion up to two meters for up to 30 minutes. The industry standard, OnePlus notes, is about 1.5 meters. This means you can take a dip in the pool, use it in the bathtub, or even ignore any worry if it accidentally falls into the toilet and you need to rinse it off.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a> indicates protection against high-pressure water jets up to 176°F (80°C) from any direction. So, take it out on the boat while jet skiing, out during a heavy rainstorm, or even have it in your hand while partaking in an epic water hose fight. During a demo at the OnePlus 13 launch event, OnePlus even showed us how the phone could run through a top-rack dishwasher cycle and come out unscathed. Though we wouldn't recommend it, it's a testament to the phone's durability and water resistance.</p><p>What do the other ratings mean? The IP66 rating simply means it's protected against water jets from any direction, including those that are not high-pressure nor high-temperature. So, cold-water jets from a faucet, for example, should be fine.</p><p>IP69K, meanwhile, is the highest IP standard possible. The 9K refers to high-pressure, high-temperature jets from any direction, including at close range. The "K" simply confirms that OnePlus has tested the phone under very specific conditions. To put this in perspective, close-range, high-temperature, high-pressure water jets are similar to what you'd experience at a car wash.</p><h2 id="important-things-to-note-about-ip-certification-in-general-2">Important things to note about IP certification in general</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aG6TQwRtqW7X399CngzNq" name="oneplus-13-in-the-lake-02" alt="Holding the blue OnePlus 13 under water in a lake" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aG6TQwRtqW7X399CngzNq.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As with any water-resistant device, there are a few things to note when understanding Ingress Protection (IP) ratings. These pertain to freshwater sources, including your tap water at home, rainwater, and even a pool. However, it does not include salt water, as salt can corrode electronics. If you're swimming in the ocean, then it's best to leave this phone — or any piece of electronics, for that matter — back at your beach chairs.</p><p>Take chlorine into account as well. If you're at a public indoor pool swimming in very heavily chlorinated water, you might want to proceed with caution. The phone should be fine, especially if you rinse and dry it off after a dunk. But keep this in mind. Because of the resistance to high temperatures and water jets, however, go ahead and bring it into the hot tub, even down that water slide (as long as you have it safely secured to you!)</p><p>One more thing to note is that water-resistance ratings on any device degrade over time. As the phone ages, it won't retain the same level of water resistance. With that said, try to keep it away from water sources when it isn't necessary (of course, don't hesitate to take those in-pool and water-gun-fight photos) and protect it with a case. But if it takes a dunk with you, you want to take underwater pictures, or you need to rinse it off after getting sand on it at the beach, go ahead.</p><p>This phone is arguably the most durable consumer-level phone available today and easily overtakes the OnePlus 13 as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-waterproof-phone">the best waterproof phone</a> right now.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7bcca6ae-fecf-49d6-9c77-2fdf930bd944">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Ultimate durability</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 15, currently available in China and coming soon to North America, offers the ultimate in durability.

Now, the company is showing off a prototype and reference design for Android XR glasses at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) event. It also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.magicleap.com/newsroom/magic-leap-showcases-ar-expertise-in-glasses-prototype-extends-google-partnership" target="_blank">announced</a> a deal to extend the partnership between Magic Leap and Google for three years.</p><p>The event provided our first look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> smart glasses since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-i-o-2025-the-biggest-announcements-from-ai-to-android-xr">Google I/O</a>, where the AR glasses were demoed. The reference glasses use Google’s Raxium microLED light engine and Magic Leap's waveguides and optics technology to provide crisp in-lens visuals.</p><p>It's unclear whether Magic Leap or Google would ever release these Android XR smart glasses. For now, they're prototype and reference glasses that serve as a launching pad for other manufacturers. However, Magic Leap said it is becoming "an AR ecosystem partner" with Google, which could leave the door open for future consumer products.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="u7dAh7sT3vxNonDQSX8Fn7" name="magicleap-google-android-xr-smart-glasses-golf" alt="Magic Leap Android XR smart glasses as seen at FII 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u7dAh7sT3vxNonDQSX8Fn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Magic Leap)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Magic Leap's optics, display systems, and hardware expertise have been essential to advancing our Android XR glasses concepts to life," said Shahram Izadi, who is the vice president of Google XR.  "We're fortunate to collaborate with a team whose years of hands-on AR development uniquely set them up to help shape what comes next."</p><p>Magic Leap says it's also working with other partners to create AR glasses based on its current concept designs.</p><h2 id="a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-android-xr-glasses-2">A glimpse into the future of Android XR glasses</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pV9J9-LQ9NU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>It's hard to tell how these reference Android XR glasses might compare to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">what we saw at Google I/O</a> based on the on-stage demonstrations. It's even trickier to gauge how they might stack up against Meta Ray-Ban Display, the smart glasses that recently made AR glasses with a waveguide display available to consumers. With that being said, it's clear that Google's partnerships with Gentle Monster, Warby Parker, and now Magic Leap prioritize design, style, and display quality.</p><p>"What makes this prototype stand out is how natural it feels to look through," Izadi added. "Magic Leap's precision in optics and waveguide design gives the display a level of clarity and stability that’s rare in AR today. That consistency is what makes it possible to seamlessly blend physical and digital vision, so users' eyes stay relaxed and the experience feels comfortable."</p><p>Android XR is progressing rapidly, with Samsung confirming this month it is working with Google, Gentle Monster, and Warby Parker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gentle-monster-warby-parker">to build smart glasses that might challenge Meta</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company’s operating profit surged 32.5% year over year to KRW 12.2 trillion (about $8.5 billion). While a massive boom in semiconductor chips is fueling this fire, a closer look shows that the company's big bet on foldable phones is also a core part of Samsung’s financial success.</p><p>The Mobile eXperience (MX) division, which handles Galaxy smartphones, booked revenue of KRW 34.1 trillion and operating profit of KRW 3.6 trillion. Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-third-quarter-2025-results" target="_blank">official report</a> states this growth, both quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year, was driven by the launch of new foldable phones.</p><p>That’s a direct nod to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>. These devices, along with other flagship models and strong tablet and wearables sales, drove the mobile division's revenue up 11% from the previous quarter.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uQSNHarYqtCMB9R36fWydT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-9" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQSNHarYqtCMB9R36fWydT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5284" height="2972" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="chips-lead-the-charge-2">Chips lead the charge</h2><p>Meanwhile, the Device Solutions (DS) segment, which includes Samsung’s memory, foundry, and other semiconductor operations, saw sales rise 19% from the previous quarter. The Memory business set a new revenue record, thanks mostly to strong demand for HBM3E chips and server SSDs.</p><p>Samsung's semiconductor business posted an operating profit of KRW 7.0 trillion. To put that in perspective, its profit was just KRW 400 billion in the second quarter. This growth is almost entirely thanks to the AI boom.</p><p>With the AI infrastructure build-out underway, HBM3E and server SSD demand shot up, pushing Samsung’s Memory Business to an all-time high quarterly revenue.</p><h2 id="a-powerful-two-pronged-strategy-2">A powerful two-pronged strategy</h2><p>This combination gives Samsung a strong advantage.

These results, which beat analyst expectations, show Samsung's two biggest bets are paying off at the same time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's the natural rival to Apple Vision Pro, the innovative, but generally unsuccessful, VR headset priced at a whopping $3,500. It looks like Samsung used Vision Pro as a baseline for Galaxy XR — the headset nearly matches Apple's offering spec-for-spec, even besting it in some categories.</p><p>Samsung priced the Galaxy XR at $1,800, almost exactly half the price of the Vision Pro. Naturally, that makes the Samsung Galaxy XR a bit easier for tech enthusiasts to justify. Both are still firmly early-adopter products, regardless, but which one is best? Let's compare all the features and differences between Galaxy XR and Vision Pro.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-xr-vs-apple-vision-pro-design-and-displays-2">Samsung Galaxy XR vs. Apple Vision Pro: Design and displays</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3MBrZbuQASBF3AueXAK4XY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-press-photo-side-view" alt="A photo of Samsung Galaxy XR sitting on a pedestal from a top-down, right-side angle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MBrZbuQASBF3AueXAK4XY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3938" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung took notes from the VR headsets that predated the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Galaxy XR</a>, and it paid off. Instead of trying to copy one headset, the company picked the best features from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Meta Quest Pro</a> and Apple Vision Pro in designing Galaxy XR. The end result is a headset with a striking appearance and the ability to be used with or without light blockers.</p><p>By comparison, Vision Pro is designed to be used with its light seal all the time. There are no first-party options for Vision Pro open facial interfaces. If you get creative, third-party accessories and 3D print files can fill the gap.

It adds 120Hz support, hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, and better rendering.</p><p>In other words, Vision Pro will deliver crisper images with M5 despite using the same display hardware. The headset also uses an Apple R1 co-processor specialized for taking in and processing data from the headset's wide assortment of cameras and sensors.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy XR is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 processor. It's still a very good chip, bringing a 20% higher CPU frequency and 15% higher GPU frequency than the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2. The latter powers the Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S, but the more powerful variant is key to running Galaxy XR smoothly.</p><div ><table><caption>Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy XR</p></th><th  ><p>Apple Vision Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2</p></td><td  ><p>Apple M5 (or Apple M2)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>16GB RAM; 256GB storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 1TB storage</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>3,552 x 3,840, 29 million pixels Micro-OLED; 96% DCI-P3</p><p></p></td><td  ><p>3,660 × 3,200, 23 million pixels, Micro-OLED, 92% DCI-P3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>60Hz, 72Hz (default), 90Hz</p></td><td  ><p>90Hz, 96Hz, 100Hz, or 120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Field of view</p></td><td  ><p>109ºH; 100ºV</p></td><td  ><p>~100º</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>6.5MP; 18mm/ F2.0</p></td><td  ></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Two passthrough cameras; six world-facing tracking cameras; four eye-tracking cameras; five IMUs; one depth sensor; one flicker sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Two high-resolution main cameras (for passthrough); Six tracking cameras on the sides and bottoms (for hand tracking); Four internal tracking cameras (for eye tracking); LiDAR scanner and TrueDepth camera (for depth perception); Four inertial measurement units (IMUs); Flicker sensor; Ambient light sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mics & speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Six-mic array with beamforming; two dual speakers (Woofer + Tweeter)</p></td><td  ><p>Six-mic array with directional beam forming; Dual-driver audio pods</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio codecs</p></td><td  ><p>MP3, AMR-NB/WB, AAC/ AAC+/ eAAC+, Vorbis, FLAC, Opus, Dolby Digital (Plus, Atmos)</p></td><td  ><p>AAC, MP3, Apple Lossless, FLAC, Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, and Dolby Atmos</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video</p></td><td  ><p>Resolution: UDH 8K (7,680 x 4,320) @ 60FPS</p><p>Codecs: H.263, H.264, HEVC, MV-HEVC, MPEG-4, VC-1, VP8, VP9, AV1</p></td><td  ><p>Codecs: HEVC, MV‑HEVC, H.264, AV1, HDR with Dolby Vision, HDR10, and HLG</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>2 hours general use, 2.5 hours video watching</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 2.5 hours of general use; 3 hours video watching</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7 (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax/be); Bluetooth 5.4</p></td><td  ><p>Wi‑Fi 6 (802.11ax); Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>IPD</p></td><td  ><p>54–70mm</p></td><td  ><p>51–75 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>545g with forehead cushion (not including light shield)</p><p>Battery weighs 302g</p></td><td  ><p>750–800 grams, including cushion, light seal, and dual knit band</p><p>Battery weighs 353g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Samsung sells Galaxy XR in one 256GB storage configuration with 16GB of RAM.

However, a recent report revealed that Samsung decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">cancel the Galaxy S26 Edge</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">bring back the Galaxy S26 Plus</a> instead, since sales of the Galaxy S25 Edge weren't promising.</p><p>Now, a new report claims the Galaxy S26 Edge might not be canceled after all. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-s26-edge/">GalaxyClub</a>, Samsung hasn't scrapped the Galaxy S26 Edge despite rumors, and in fact, the company plans to make the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> even thinner.</p><h2 id="galaxy-s26-edge-might-still-be-in-samsung-s-plans-2">Galaxy S26 Edge might still be in Samsung's plans</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NrJKSSZYtxDEwx9syY4kmW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-03" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrJKSSZYtxDEwx9syY4kmW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The report states that Samsung has been working on a smartphone codenamed "More Slim." For reference, the Galaxy S25 Edge's internal codename was "Slim." Interestingly, development on "More Slim" reportedly began later than the Galaxy S26 Edge, suggesting it may not be the same device Samsung was originally planning.</p><p>The report also speculates that Samsung may have decided the Galaxy S26 Edge needed to be even thinner to secure its place in 2026, leading to the "More Slim" project and the possible cancellation of the original S26 Edge prototype.</p><p>Additionally, the report states that the Galaxy S26 Edge might skip launching alongside the rest of the Galaxy S26 lineup and instead arrive later, similar to how the Galaxy S25 Edge was introduced.</p><p>That said, the report reiterates that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">Galaxy S26 Plus will launch</a> with the S26 lineup, which seems certain at this point. There are also reports that the Galaxy S26 series launch could be slightly delayed compared to last year's Galaxy S25 series, which debuted in January 2025.</p><p>Of course, a lot could change before the phones actually launch next year, but it appears Samsung is having some internal challenges with the Galaxy S26 lineup right now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With the Samsung Galaxy S25 marking just an iterative update over the Samsung Galaxy S24, the expectation is that the Samsung Galaxy S26 will be better in many ways. For now, let's take a look at the rumors and speculation around what we might be able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">expect from the Galaxy S26</a>.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-potential-design-and-basic-spec-changes-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 vs. Samsung Galaxy S24: Potential design and basic spec changes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gKRgz2SqdcJaUh4DKQNCAZ" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of Galaxy S26 Pro leak showcasing a slimmer design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gKRgz2SqdcJaUh4DKQNCAZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no word yet on finish options for the Galaxy S26, but there will probably be at least some new colors, including Samsung-exclusive ones, as has been the case with the Galaxy series. The Armor Aluminum construction may continue, giving it a lightweight and durable feel.</p><p>Screen size is speculated to increase slightly to 6.27 inches, which isn’t a huge bump, but may provide more screen area with the same compact size. The expectation is that it will also be thinner.</p><p>It will probably still have the same individual rings around the cameras, but this time with a vertical camera bump housing the sensors .

There's also speculation that the battery capacity could increase from 4,000 mAh in the Galaxy S24 (and the S25) to 4,300 mAh, which means the phone will last a little longer.</p><p>It's likely that the base Galaxy S26 model will stick with 25W charging. It could meet its higher-end counterparts in offering up to 45W wired charging with a compatible adapter and cable. It should continue to support wireless charging and Power Share. An upgrade could be built-in magnets for Qi2 charging without the need for a case, akin to what Google has done with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">latest Pixel 10 line</a>.</p><p>Looking back at the Samsung Galaxy S24, which was introduced in January 2024, that model comes in Cobalt Violet, Amber Yellow, Onyx Black, and Marble Grey. There are also Samsung-exclusive colors, Sapphire Blue, Sandstone Orange, and Jade Green. It has a flat front and back with rounded edges and a satin finish, and cameras running down the back in a vertical row, the same as the Galaxy S25.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-spec-comparison-2"> Samsung Galaxy S26 vs. Samsung Galaxy S24: Spec comparison</h2><p>How do these phones compare head-to-head on specs alone?

It will likely feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> chip, though some think it may use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-might-rock-the-exynos-2600-chip-but-only-in-this-region">Exynos 2600</a> chip instead, at least in some markets. This is what Samsung did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, suggesting it might follow the same strategy for the entry model in the new series.</p><p>By contrast, the Samsung Galaxy S24 features a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor and 8GB of RAM. There's no word on how much RAM the new phone will have, but Samsung upped it to 12GB for the Galaxy S25, so it's likely the Galaxy S26 will carry that over.</p><p>Stereo speakers are pretty much a given, along with plenty of AI goodies, including Gemini Live and Bixby. But some sources suggest Samsung could expand Galaxy S26 support for third-party chatbots. The Galaxy S24 was the first device in the line to get AI upgrades, including fun and useful features like Google's Circle to Search, Live Translate, Note Assist, Transcript Assist, and more.</p><p>It's unclear if Samsung will add more AI features to the Galaxy S26, though it will likely have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-already-chasing-one-ui-8-5-new-leak-spots-galaxy-s25-test">Samsung One UI 8.5</a> and whatever new features come with it.</p><p>One rumored new feature discussed is called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/understanding-private-mode-samsung-galaxy-s6">Privacy Display Mode</a>, though it may only be available on the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra. With this supposed feature, the phone would automatically dim the screen when you're accessing sensitive information or in crowded places. One UI 8.5 will also purportedly have Privacy Protection, which could automatically blur or redact sensitive on-screen information, like driver's license or passport details, to keep your information secure.</p><p>The same seven years of software and security updates are expected, which has become standard for Samsung phones.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-camera-improvements-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 vs. Samsung Galaxy S24: Camera improvements</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vzZF2vMD6U3NqKAxRifnhh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-camera-lenses-02.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the smaller Samsung Galaxy S24" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vzZF2vMD6U3NqKAxRifnhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung hasn't made any groundbreaking improvements to its cameras between the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S25, but fans are hoping this will change with the Galaxy S26. First, consider the Galaxy S24. It has a 50MP primary sensor, a 12MP ultrawide, a 10MP telephoto, and a 12MP front "selfie" camera. You get 30x space zoom and 3x optical zoom.</p><p>Not much changed with the Samsung Galaxy S25. But the hope is that the Galaxy S26's cameras will improve. While it might retain the same 50MP primary sensor, it could be larger, allowing it to capture more light.</p><p>It's unclear if the Galaxy S26 will see any improvements in zoom capabilities. The Samsung Galaxy S25 improved in this department with 100x Space Zoom and 3x optical zoom, so the new model's specs should at least match that.</p><p>Of course, all the same AI photo editing tools will almost certainly be carried over to the new model. This includes features such as Generative Edit, Sketch to Image, and more. Whether or not image capture overall is better remains to be seen. One area the Galaxy S24 struggled with was photos that include motion, so the hope is that the S26 will improve on this. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review#section-samsung-galaxy-s25-cameras">reviewer Brady Snyder</a> noted some improvements with the Galaxy S25, but there's still work to be done.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-which-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 vs. Samsung Galaxy S24: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qyEYgwM83FhJcV4rxp47AZ" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of Galaxy S26 Pro leak showcasing a slimmer design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qyEYgwM83FhJcV4rxp47AZ.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Will the Samsung Galaxy S26 be named among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">the best Galaxy phones</a>?

If you already own it, there's no need to upgrade yet unless the Samsung Galaxy S26 offers compelling upgrades that make it worthwhile, or your carrier offers a killer trade-in deal.</p><p>New technology is always a game of chicken. Do you wait to see what the new model has to offer? Sometimes, it's incredible, and you kick yourself for having jumped the gun on an existing model too soon. Sometimes, it's an iterative update, and you realize it wasn't worth waiting. It's a tough decision, but with limited details so far on the Galaxy S26, you'll have to make that judgment call.</p><p>Based on speculation, it could be just another iterative update. Feature-wise, you'll be able to update the S24 with new AI features and Samsung One UI 8.5 anyway. I'd recommend keeping it for now. If you still find the S24 new for a fantastic price and you're upgrading from a much older phone and want things like AI integration, that model is still a great option.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3e95e6c4-d07f-4e72-a756-a7f0d1ce9fd3">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzkcj8YMqwNYbgHkLXibwc.jpg' alt="The rumored product render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Wait and see</strong></em></p><p>Samsung continues to innovate with its smartphones, but when it comes to the entry model in the Galaxy series, there are sometimes concessions that are dealbreakers.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>It looks like Google's riding the high of its recent AI image generator, and it's looking to put it front and center.</p><p>If you're going to browse the web, you might open Chrome, and that's where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://windowsreport.com/nano-banana-and-deep-search-come-to-chromes-search-box/">Windows Report</a> comes in, as a recent test illuminates Google's plans. Reportedly, the company's latest Chrome Canary version (Google Chrome's test environment) brought in two major AI features that the company has placed elsewhere in its ecosystem. Specifically, the publication states the test update focused on new tabs in Chrome on desktop, as it integrates <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-says-nano-banana-drove-in-over-10-million-new-users-to-gemini-app">Nano Banana</a>.</p><p>How Google is seemingly preparing to do this is via a new "AI Chip." This "chip" is supposedly going to be placed right under the pre-existing textbox in the center of any new tab in Chrome.</p><p>In the test, the publication states that clicking Nano Banana changes the centered text box. Instead of saying "Search Google or type a URL," it now says "Create an image of..." From there, users can type what they'd like the AI to create, which will generate, but how and where (two important questions) aren't narrowed down yet. The post states that while Nano Banana is appearing, the feature in its entirety isn't fully fleshed out, meaning those important details are missing.</p><p>Similarly, the post mentions that AI Mode's "Deep Search" is getting its own AI chip. All this does is push the AI to dive deeper into its research for complex questions (you can access this in AI Mode natively already). It seems Google's just interested in making it more "in your face," rather than hopping into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">AI Mode</a> beforehand.</p><h2 id="google-s-popular-ai-features-take-center-stage-2">Google's popular AI features take center stage</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.71%;"><img id="YiYjp3BtuW3PRccBmHBn9T" name="google-chrome-test-nano-banana-deep-search-chips-new-tab" alt="A screenshot from a Google Chrome test, which shows the company is supposedly testing a Nano Banana and Deep Search from AI Mode "chip" on new tabs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YiYjp3BtuW3PRccBmHBn9T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="467" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Windows Report)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a way, it makes sense that Google is trying so hard to push its AI Mode software to more people in a place where they often start. During the summer, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-search-call-around-agentic-gemini-2-5-pro-ai-mode-update">AI Mode got a major update</a> that brought Deep Search into the world. Courtesy of Gemini 2.5 Pro, AI Mode's Deep Search can "save hours by issuing hundreds of searches, reasoning across disparate pieces of information and crafting a comprehensive, fully-cited report in minutes."</p><p>If you've got Google's AI Pro or AI Ultra, you can enjoy Gemini 2.5 Pro's influence on AI Mode.</p><p>When it comes to Google Chrome and AI, the company's been slowly but surely feeding more into it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-in-chrome-browsing-with-ai-assisted-answers-security-more-announced">just like it did last month</a>. Gemini in Chrome was the big headline in September, as Google improved browsing, security, and more for Android and PC users. Now, when scrolling through articles or other lengthy pages in Chrome, users can tap the Gemini icon and have it summarize its contents.</p><p>That huge September brought the AI Mode icon to Chrome's New Tab page, too. Then, there's Nano Banana, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-nano-banana-ai-image-tool-is-taking-over-your-favorite-apps">which is confirmed</a> to be on its way to Search and Lens.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It shows up literally as a single LED in the bottom corner of the rear panel for when you receive notifications.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="acPkVEm54pD7ddw4JV6ekb" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-Lite" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite arrives" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/acPkVEm54pD7ddw4JV6ekb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for the other specifications, the Phone 3a Lite is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro chipset under the hood. Coming to its display, it gets a reasonably large 6.7-inch FHD+ Flexible AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Another highlight of the device is that it gets a massive 5,000 mAh battery that the company claims will last you "comfortably for almost two days with mixed use." The phone gets  33W fast charging, and reaches 50% in approximately 20 minutes, though this charger is sold separately.</p><p>The Phone 3a Lite gets a triple-camera array, with a primary 50MP lens  (with OIS/EIS), accompanied by an 8MP ultra-wide camera and a 2MP macro lens. It also has a 16MP selfie camera as well. Nothing says that the large 1/1.57-inch Samsung sensor captures 64% more light than typical sensors, ensuring high performance of these rear lenses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qShmNoxgY7v48uEwMVmcjb" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-Lite" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Lite arrives" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qShmNoxgY7v48uEwMVmcjb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Phone (3a) Lite gets Nothing OS 3.5 (Android 15) out of the box and comes with features like Essential Key, Private Space, and App Locker.

However, while these foldables are more affordable and more widely sold than their larger-screened folding counterparts, the options for flip phones haven't grown very much, especially in North America.</p><p>While there are a few more options abroad from companies like Xiaomi, flip phones in the United States are largely limited to Samsung and Motorola. The Razr spearheaded the return of the flip phone, while the Galaxy Z Flip popularized it, and now it seems the Razr has since perfected the formula. And while it would be nice to see more flip phones in the U.S., these are still great options to consider, especially as we start to see some impressive deals on the latest models.</p><h2 id="the-best-flip-phone-of-2025-is-on-sale-again-2">The best flip phone of 2025 is on sale again</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FV7AQ3CTv5bycnknZBnA9D" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-41" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 outside in tent mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FV7AQ3CTv5bycnknZBnA9D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4073" height="2291" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> is currently my favorite phone of the year, building on the winning formula of its predecessors.

The post confirms that the device will arrive in the U.S. and Canada on November 13. While this is good news, OnePlus states consumers in these respective regions can expect a more detailed report about the phone's pricing in two weeks when it arrives.</p><p>The company will have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@OnePlusTech">a global launch event</a> that's streamed live on its YouTube channel. In its promotional era, there's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/launch/oneplus-15">a small event</a> taking place for the OnePlus 15 on the company's main website for the U.S. (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/ca_en/launch/oneplus-15">Canada, too</a>). Consumers who subscribe on its main page can "receive an extra $50 off, or get a chance to win the OnePlus Pad 3 for FREE."</p><p>Fueling the hype, the OnePlus 15 features Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC, as well as the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygenos-16-arrives-as-a-software-that-truly-knows-you">OxygenOS 16</a> software. One of its more major highlights concerns its DetailMax Engine for photography. OnePlus says its new engine works to bring better true-to-life imagery taken through its available cameras. The OnePlus 15 sports the Clear Night Engine for low-light scenarios to help "eliminate" flaws between exposures.</p><p>What users find after should be a clearer and more detailed nighttime/low-light photo.</p><h2 id="the-latest-global-launch-2">The latest global launch</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1250px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.00%;"><img id="HYK8bs6VBUUzQA3nZoX8jj" name="oneplus-15-global-launch" alt="The OnePlus 15 is preparing for a global launch, as it heads to the U.S. and Canada." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HYK8bs6VBUUzQA3nZoX8jj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1250" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-new-oneplus-15-launches-in-china">OnePlus 15 launched earlier</a> this week in China, marking a significant shift in the phone in terms of battery and overall device strength. While the phone rocks a 6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED display, there is a redesign for its camera array. The device features three lenses in a rounded, square housing, spearheaded by a 50MP primary sensor. Probably what's turning more heads is the phone's massive 7,300mAh battery.</p><p>OnePlus truly leaned into its Glacier Battery technology to bring a battery that beats its previous phone generations by a mile. This incredible battery's been paired with 120W fast-charging, meaning you're not only scrolling for longer, but your charging breaks are even shorter.</p><p>In China, the OnePlus 15 started at CNY 3,999 (~$562 USD), so that gives us an idea of what we <em>might </em>see when November 13 rolls around.</p><p>Also, the brand's major OxygenOS 16 is available on the newest model, as previously mentioned. However, the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oxygenos-16-roll-out-next-month-the-first-oneplus-phones-to-get-it">been busy detailing</a> what other phones should expect OxygenOS 16, starting in November. The OnePlus 13, 13R, and 13s are first on the list with the OnePlus 12.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster cites an "exclusive preview," before highlighting that the company is looking to roll out Pixel "Theme Packs" next month. Supposedly, the first-ever pack for Pixels will coincide with the upcoming Disney film, Wicked: For Good.</p><p>The leak suggests users can find this new Pixel Theme in the "Wallpapers & Styles" menu after long-pressing their home screen once this update arrives.</p><p>Elsewhere, another key highlight the post mentioned concerns "Pixel VIP notifications."</p><p>Mystic Leaks claims this feature is getting a little QoL, which now brings "prioritized" alerts for your set VIP contacts. However, they state that the feature is seemingly going to be limited to texts sent through Google Messages and WhatsApp first when this arrives. In the provided screenshot, rumors allege that notifications from your "Pixel VIPs" will be highlighted in yellow, and you'll also see their profile picture in your device's status bar.</p><p>The idea is to, of course, draw more attention to any Pixel VIPs you may have.</p><h2 id="thankful-for-updates-2">Thankful for updates?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1022px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.87%;"><img id="a77TH3fNMSHwkBCx2aWcqe" name="google-pixel-alleged-november-2025-drop-details" alt="A screenshot of some leaked details regarding Google's supposed November 2025 Pixel Drop, which could bring a new Pixel Studio update, Pixel VIPs, and a Pixel Theme." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a77TH3fNMSHwkBCx2aWcqe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1022" height="571" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mystic Leaks / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The final update that the tipster mentions is for the Pixel Studio. Supposedly, Google is preparing an update that Pixel users "breathe new life" into photos and GIFs. The alleged promotional material states that the Pixel Studio will give users the tools to turn their images into a GIF or an animated sticker. It seems the feature will gain an "animate image" button once inside.</p><p>The rumors conclude by stating Pixel users may see this major drop on November 4, which is just next week. Let's see what happens first before we set these rumors in stone.</p><p>Google's Pixels <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-drop-september-material-3-expressive-expansion-adaptive-audio">had a huge drop back in September</a>, an update that brought a Material 3 Expressive expansion. After hitting the company's more recent devices first, Android's newest design overhaul started rolling out for the Pixel 6 and Pixel Tablet. More than that, users found better customization for lock and call screens, as well as a new, sleek revamp for Quick Settings. Even the Pixel Buds Pro 2 got in on the fun, grabbing an Adaptive Audio update that adjusts your audio depending on your surroundings.</p><p>Testing-wise, we're wrapped up in Google's Android 16 QPR2 beta, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-rolls-out-bootloader-fix-in-android-16-qpr2-beta-3-1">as v3.1 rolled out a week ago</a>. That update was a rush order, as Google sought to correct a major bootloader looping issue that plagued Pixels trying to reach the original v3.0 update. Aside from the problems, QPR2 Beta 3 brought a few new features that testers can enjoy, alongside a host of Pixel fixes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Me neither, but there are many folks who do, and <em>even more</em> folks who are hoping to buy the new Samsung Galaxy XR headset this holiday season. This guide will tell you how you can order your very own XR today, how you could possibly save some money on the purchase, and what all of it means for the state of mixed reality in 2025/2026. </p><p>The result of a longstanding collaboration between Samsung and Google, the Galaxy XR headset finally hit store shelves on October 21st. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">We've already used the XR</a> a good bit, and it's clear that Apple and Meta have some new competition in the world of AR and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headsets</a>. </p><p>Just like the Vision Pro, Samsung's premium headset is more than just a gaming console, utilizing a Snapdragon chipset to give users the ability to surf the web, game, and stream their favorite content - all at the same time. And unlike the competition from Apple and Meta, Google has confirmed that all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Android apps</a> in the Google Play store will be available to the Galaxy XR straight out of the box.</p><p>So how do you buy it? Well, as of writing, you can only buy the Galaxy XR headset directly from Samsung, and it'll cost you a pretty penny. Let's dive in. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-xr-deals"><span>Samsung Galaxy XR deals</span></h3><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a848c351-a119-41c9-8a39-0ffb90a02178" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: $1,799.99 at Samsung" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: $1,799.99 at Samsung" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/xr/galaxy-xr/galaxy-xr/buy/galaxy-xr-256gb-silver-shadow-wi-fi-sm-i610nzsaxar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PLNBFvfigQSH4NpRjcJKy6" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-side-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PLNBFvfigQSH4NpRjcJKy6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: </strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps" data-dimension112="a848c351-a119-41c9-8a39-0ffb90a02178" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: $1,799.99 at Samsung" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: $1,799.99 at Samsung" data-dimension25=""><strong>$1,799.99 at Samsung</strong></a></p><p>At this time, you can only buy the Galaxy XR directly from Samsung. The headset costs $1,800, but if you order before the end of the year, you'll get a bunch of free stuff through the "Explorer Pack", such as a year of YouTube Premium alongside a year of Google AI Pro, NBA League Pass, Calm Premium, and more. </p><p>This package deal pretty much sets you up for a premium mixed reality experience straight out of the box, and while the price tag is still steep, hopefully the freebies can lessen the blow. </p><p>The big question now is whether we might see better <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">Samsung deals</a> on the XR as we approach Black Friday. At this point it's too soon to say, but I wouldn't count on it unless the headset reaches other stores, such as Amazon and Best Buy, very soon. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/xr/galaxy-xr/galaxy-xr/buy/galaxy-xr-256gb-silver-shadow-wi-fi-sm-i610nzsaxar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a848c351-a119-41c9-8a39-0ffb90a02178" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: $1,799.99 at Samsung" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy XR Headset 256GB: $1,799.99 at Samsung" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-xr-faq"><span>Samsung Galaxy XR FAQ</span></h3><h2 id="what-is-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-2">What is the Samsung Galaxy XR?</h2><p>The result of a collaboration between Samsung and Google, the Galaxy XR is a next-generation mixed reality headset packed full of cutting-edge hardware and its own bespoke version of Android. </p><p>Unlike some VR headsets, which are primarily geared towards gaming, the XR is more like Samsung's answer to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-launch-sales-success">Apple Vision Pro</a>, offering users the ability to enjoy entertainment, productivity, and social media apps all in one device (and at the same time). There's a reason we keep calling it a "laptop for your face". </p><p>The XR is designed to be comfortable enough to wear for hours on end, and the lack of required controllers means that the headset is easy to carry and use wherever you are. The XR comes equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2, a considerably faster chipset than what's found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>, while the 3552 x 3840 resolution display is one of the best we've ever seen in a headset. </p><h2 id="how-much-does-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-cost-2">How much does the Samsung Galaxy XR cost?</h2><p>The Galaxy XR headset costs $1,799.99 for the 256GB version, or around $75 per month if you pay through Samsung financing. That's obviously pretty expensive, but it's still way more affordable than the Apple Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499. </p><p>Your purchase of the Galaxy XR will also come with a protective cover, light shields, a battery pack, cables, and more, not to mention all of the free entertainment services included in the "Explorer Pack" detailed above. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aJmgPPA92R2VBSsuJ8tjAN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-pinch-controls" alt="A photo of the author wearing the Samsung Galaxy XR headset, holding up one hand in a pinch gesture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aJmgPPA92R2VBSsuJ8tjAN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="should-i-wait-for-black-friday-to-buy-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-2">Should I wait for Black Friday to buy the Samsung Galaxy XR? </h2><p>It's unlikely that the Samsung Galaxy XR will appear in very many Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales this year, but you never know. It'll largely depend on whether or not traditional retailers like Amazon and Best Buy start carrying the device before the end of the year.</p><p>That being said, since Samsung's "Explorer Pack" offer is available until the end of the year, it couldn't hurt to wait a few weeks and see what happens as the Black Friday sales go live. Needless to say, I'll be updating this guide with any new deals as they go live, so feel free to check back later to see what's new. </p> ]]></dc:content>

Thankfully, the developers of Little Planet heard the call and are launching what feels like Animal Crossing VR on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest platform</a> on October 30, 2025, for the crowd-pleasing price of free.</p><p>Just as in Animal Crossing, players start out making their own avatar, followed by selecting one of three islands to begin their journey on. Here, you'll be harvesting resources, building houses, making friends, and collecting over 4,000 items to decorate your world with. You can also sculpt the land to bring your vision to life.</p><p>Unlike Animal Crossing, items in Little Planet are interactive. Place a piano down in your house and you can actually play music on it. Drop a basketball hoop down and shoot hoops with friends. You can even ride inflatables in the water! That's one of my biggest complaints with the Animal Crossing series, and it's been solved here.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="E2cpMzb9jQoatd4AJKcA2C" name="little-planet-screenshot-04" alt="Playing with virtual pets in Little Planet on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E2cpMzb9jQoatd4AJKcA2C.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qJmDd3jQkwwEaWjoSwFyzB" name="little-planet-screenshot-02" alt="Playing in Little Planet's Halloween world on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qJmDd3jQkwwEaWjoSwFyzB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HUjJn4DAUGap7GAGTA4a2C" name="little-planet-screenshot-03" alt="Playing with virtual pets in Little Planet on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HUjJn4DAUGap7GAGTA4a2C.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>With the free-to-play launch version, Little Planet is debuting two huge new systems that transform the game: a virtual pet system, and a ton of new multiplayer features. Several different virtual pets can now be chosen from and will follow you around, begging for pets and treats. From abstract creatures to cute capybaras, the game likely has something you'll love to keep around for the long haul.</p><p>The new multiplayer lobby also makes it simple to find people in game and make new friends, join in seasonal festivities, and play a ton of new multiplayer-focused games. This lobby is a central way to socialize in the game, something that's not always easy to do in Animal Crossing.</p><p>I got to join the developers in the Halloween-themed area which, as you might imagine, changes regularly depending on the season or holiday. It's yet another area where the game improves over the classic Animal Crossing formula.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rz6gWctRDqq8RUdeMupb2C" name="little-planet-screenshot-01" alt="Checking out Little Planet's new multiplayer lobby on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rz6gWctRDqq8RUdeMupb2C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The multiplayer games are a great way to change up the normal gameplay in fun ways, including a scavenger hunt, a giant maze, fishing contests, and more.

The developers call this the Founders Pack and it includes a full year of the "Little Planet Premium" subscription, exclusive items for your planet, and a unique founder's hoodie and name tag that will never be available again.</p><p>If you haven't jumped onboard yet, you can still grab <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/little-planet-early-access/5749790791804399/">Little Planet Early Access for $20</a> on October 29 and get the full Founders Pack.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The headlines since the Galaxy XR's launch have been pretty clear. Samsung's first Android XR-powered headset is fantastic, and it's being lauded as the more affordable Apple Vision Pro we've been asking for. But does that mean it's right for you?</p><p>That question depends entirely on what you plan to do with it, of course! Just like the Apple Vision Pro, Samsung and Google have posited that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Galaxy XR</a> is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-the-samsung-galaxy-xr-headset-can-live-up-to-its-price-tag">for entertainment and productivity</a>, with a little sidecar of gaming attached.</p><p>That means if you're looking to work on your headset and want an infinite canvas of monitors surrounding you at all times, the Samsung Galaxy XR is the best way to achieve that goal. Similarly, if you regularly find yourself at home disinterested in what everyone else is watching or playing, Galaxy XR is a great way to kick back and see or play what you want without being kicked off the TV again.</p><h2 id="already-ahead-of-the-pack-2">Already ahead of the pack</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2721px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QbgwEyfpF84F6a4jrZRpLY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-press-photo" alt="A photo of Samsung Galaxy XR sitting on a podium at a 30-degree front-left angle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QbgwEyfpF84F6a4jrZRpLY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2721" height="1531" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Galaxy XR has the best screen ever in a VR headset, packing in an incredible 29 million pixels in a pair of micro-OLED panels. These panels are powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 chipset and, since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> runs the show, every single Android app on the Google Play Store works on the headset.</p><p>That means any streaming app, productivity app, or really any app at all can be found and used on the headset, so you don't need to wildly adjust your current habits to jump into Galaxy XR's amazing immersive views.</p><p>In fact, Galaxy XR is the <em>only</em> VR headset with an official Netflix app, so you get the full quality of every show and movie without worrying about browser compatibility or side-loading.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hmaaGjLYbWzSSwmJ5UbjZC" name="android-xr-google-tv-app-official" alt="Watching a movie on the Google TV app in mixed reality on Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hmaaGjLYbWzSSwmJ5UbjZC.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On top of that, it's easy to hook Galaxy XR up to a PC wirelessly with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=virtualdesktop.android">Virtual Desktop app</a>, or just natively hook up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsungs-new-galaxy-book-5-lineup-boasts-ai-smarts-and-cross-device-connectivity">a Galaxybook laptop</a> with Samsung's built-in software. This way, you can not only work on your PC without hurting your neck (boy, do I hate looking down at a laptop for hours), but you also get the flexibility of multiple monitors, no matter where you are.</p><p>That means you can bring your laptop and headset with you on your next work trip and still feel like you're working at home. It also means long plane rides can be a way to relax and unwind with a giant virtual theater in front of you instead of a seat 15 inches from your face.</p><h2 id="a-vr-gaming-powerhouse-2">A VR gaming powerhouse</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="svTMKttnbw5fEBx84VPWuM" name="Galaxy-XR-Walkabout-Mini-Golf-VR" alt="A photo of a Samsung engineer playing Walkabout Mini Golf while wearing the Galaxy XR headset and using a Galaxy XR controller in her right hand, a screen showing the game behind her." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/svTMKttnbw5fEBx84VPWuM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1126" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>VR gamers will find that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> is a better buy for standalone VR games, as it has thousands of titles available through Meta's store. But PC VR gamers should seriously consider the Galaxy XR, as it's currently the best wireless headset for PC gaming.</p><p>That's because the Virtual Desktop app is able to pass Galaxy XR's face tracking, eye tracking, and hand tracking capabilities to your PC, allowing apps like VRChat to use this data to create more lifelike avatars. There's no other wireless VR headset on the market with this capability and power, making it the ultimate choice for wireless PC VR gaming enthusiasts.</p><p>Do you find yourself fitting into any of these three categories? If so, the Galaxy XR may just be the standalone headset you've been waiting for. It takes everything that was great about the Meta Quest Pro and improves upon it, delivering Apple Vision Pro-like visual fidelity with a new breakthrough in Android app support made possible by Android XR. It's a phenomenal solution for folks wanting the best of the best on the Android side of things.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="4727e0e6-82ca-4e79-bf8e-94ffa2677301">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:66.67%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cxXQANwssegypWVFB9SYcS.jpg' alt="Galaxy XR side profile"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy XR</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Cutting-edge hardware meets the best XR operating system ever made.

Object Eraser helps you remove unwanted items from your photos, and Generative Edit handles larger changes, but these features are found in separate spots. This can be confusing, but Samsung plans to fix it with the upcoming One UI 8.5 update.</p><p>Samsung may be overhauling its photo editing tools with One UI 8.5, and the core change is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-object-eraser-samsung-phone">Object Eraser</a> is being merged into Generative Edit. Based on screen recordings from the new version, shared by leaker @tarunvats33 on X, the workflow will be streamlined (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/one-ui-8-5-integrates-object-eraser-with-generative-edit/" target="_blank">SammyGuru</a>). Instead of bouncing between two separate tools, users will soon be able to remove unwanted objects and fill in the background in one seamless step.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One UI 8.5: Object eraser has been integrated into generative edit. pic.twitter.com/E2LqSGp2U7<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1982410699398902058">October 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>In the current setup, Object Eraser sits as a standalone feature inside Samsung’s photo editor, allowing users to manually highlight and remove distractions from an image.</p><p>Generative Edit, on the other hand, uses AI to reconstruct missing parts of a photo or move subjects around realistically.</p><h2 id="seamless-workflow-2">Seamless workflow</h2><p>One UI 8.5 may blend these two into a single, smarter editing experience. When you open a photo and tap Generative Edit, you’ll now have direct access to erasing, filling, and reshaping tools without needing to switch tools.</p><p>Want to remove that stray photobomber? Just circle them as you would with Object Eraser. The tool will understand your intent, remove the object, and then it will instantly and intelligently fill in the background.</p><p>This integration is a part of Samsung's effort to make its AI-powered photo tools more intuitive and cohesive.</p><p>This change is expected to roll out officially with One UI 8.5, which will almost certainly make its debut on the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> series early next year.

Weeks ahead of the big sale weekend, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Headphones-Cancellation-Luxurious/dp/B0B33PXPJT/"><strong>Amazon is carving 26% off the elegant Bowers & Wilkins PX8 headphones, knocking the price down to $519.59</strong></a> for a limited time. </p><p>Bowers & Wilkins is widely-known for producing stylish, comfortable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> that please audiophiles and casual listeners alike, whether you're immersing yourself in classical music, metal, or an action-packed video game. </p><p>At $699, however, the PX8 might be a bit too expensive for some folks. Thankfully, this early Black Friday deal is making the headphones much more accessible. Will the price drop further as we approach Black Friday and Cyber Monday? It's very possible, but this deal is worthy enough on its own if you don't want to wait until next month. </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>See my guide to the best early Black Friday Samsung deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e095f2f9-5dd7-4523-9652-06a7a15a6967" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699" data-dimension48="$699" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Headphones-Cancellation-Luxurious/dp/B0B33PXPJT/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="kye7FEiQjNSuPHfa29pPrk" name="Bowers-and-Wilkins-PX8-render-square" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kye7FEiQjNSuPHfa29pPrk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Bowers & Wilkins PX8:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Headphones-Cancellation-Luxurious/dp/B0B33PXPJT/" data-dimension112="e095f2f9-5dd7-4523-9652-06a7a15a6967" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699" data-dimension48="$699" data-dimension25=""><del>$699</del> <strong>$519.59 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Bowers & Wilkins PX8 are among the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">best noise-cancelling headphones</a> we've ever used, but they're far from cheap. Fortunately, Amazon has launched an early Black Friday deal that slashes 26% off the price of the luxurious cans, making them much more accessible for music lovers all over. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bowers-Wilkins-Headphones-Cancellation-Luxurious/dp/B0B33PXPJT/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e095f2f9-5dd7-4523-9652-06a7a15a6967" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699" data-dimension48="$699" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want superbly detailed and balanced sound quality with excellent noise cancellation in a sleek, elegant package; you need headphones with great battery life. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you enjoy having lots of customization options and EQ settings with your headphones; you follow a vegan or plant-based lifestyle (the PX8 use leather in their construction).</p><p>The Bowers & Wilkins PX8 are stunning headphones inside and out, with outstanding ANC (active noise cancellation) capabilities, a versatile sound signature, and up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. With a Nappa leather and aluminum construction, the PX8 also look and feel like the height of luxury, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with other premium headphone brands like Bang & Olufsen. </p><p>Another standout feature is the headphones' USB-C port for audio, which lets you charge and listen to your favorite tunes without Bluetooth. The cans also come with a 3.5mm cable in the box. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="muRzxmtXs8dHgzAvoriuDi" name="Bowers-and-Wilkins-Px8-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Woman wearing Bowers & Wilkins Px8 headphones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muRzxmtXs8dHgzAvoriuDi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Bowers & Wilkins)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that holds the Bowers & Wilkins PX8 back is the customization. Unlike the best headphones from Bose and Sony, the PX8 don't offer a ton of customization options in the companion app, which means you're limited to basic bass and treble control. The noise-cancellation also isn't very adjustable, which is a problem at this price point.</p><p>Fortunately, the headphones come with some pretty versatile default settings and excellent ANC support with passthrough, so it shouldn't be too much of an issue for most folks. That said, if you're an audiophile who likes to finetune your EQ settings, you may wish to look at other premium headphones, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">Sony WH-1000XM6</a>. </p><p>Needless to say, if you value great performance and sophistication in your devices, this headphones deal is a dream opportunity, no matter what you're listening to. Amazon is saying that stock is low, however, so I'd act fast if you're interested: miss this deal and you'll have to wait until Black Friday to score sweet savings.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ArtemR/status/1982942504216600877">Artem Russakovskii on X</a>, Google has started rolling out age verification checks for the Play Store.</p><p>According to Russakovskii, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-play-store-sucks-so-heres-what-i-use-instead">Google Play</a> won't let you download "many apps" until you verify your age. To do so, Google is offering multiple methods, including uploading an ID, taking a selfie, using a credit card, or verifying through a third-party service called verifymy.io.</p><p>It appears that the rollout has just begun and is still expanding to users. It's unclear where the checks will be enforced first, but it appears the feature will soon arrive in the U.S. You can manually verify your age using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://g.co/play/verifyage">provided link</a> without waiting for Google to prompt you. However, not all verification methods are available in every region.</p><h2 id="you-might-soon-need-to-prove-you-re-18-on-play-store-2">You might soon need to prove you're 18 on Play Store</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SuQMV6qrMTZBu8pNzhoi2U" name="google-play-logo.jpg" alt="The Google Play Logo on stage at an event in NYC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SuQMV6qrMTZBu8pNzhoi2U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for why Google is implementing these checks, it's largely to comply with newly passed regulations in several U.S. states, including Texas, Utah, and Louisiana, that require app stores to verify users' ages before allowing them to download age-sensitive apps. Similar regulations are also set to come into effect in Texas and California.</p><p>While the move aims to protect minors from inappropriate content, many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1ocvtbh/google_age_verification_help/">users on Reddit</a> and X have expressed concerns about sharing their personal data with Google and the potential for leaks or misuse.

Each animation concerns a different type of video content. Think motor vehicles, cats, music, film, travel, and sports. When liking a video that falls into one of those categories, the "Like" button will play a unique animation that matches it.</p><p>Storm showed that liking a travel video briefly converts the thumbs up into a plane, shooting off into the sky. If you enjoyed that documentary about Africa's wildlife, hitting the like button turns it into a lightbulb.</p><p>When you get down to sports, videos for each league or sport (NBA, NFL, NHL, etc.) display an animation integral to each. Users should see a basketball, a football, a hockey puck, a soccer ball, and so forth. Storm adds that YouTube's animations don't stop there, as it has extended its work to cover entertainment genres like thrillers and romance.</p><p>These animations are already rolling out for users, though it's likely we're not all seeing them at the same time. There are roughly 20 like button animations that span a whole host of genres and video content categories.</p><h2 id="youtube-s-making-modern-moves-2">YouTube's making modern moves</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">YouTube's new like animations pic.twitter.com/n3FRtasP3D<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1983066476144886019">October 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>These animations go hand-in-hand with YouTube's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-gets-more-expressive-an-overhauled-video-player-rolls-out">major video player update</a> that started rolling out across all devices two weeks ago. Of course, the core of this update is the video player, which takes on a more modern appeal that's meant to be cleaner and "more immersive" for the viewer. Many elements take on a transparent aesthetic, ensuring viewers don't miss a single beat.</p><p>YouTube also updated its Seeking capabilities for videos, meaning double-tapping to jump ahead is "less intrusive." These new like button animations were a part of this update, though YouTube was a little vague.</p><p>It essentially mentioned the core of the update: users will see animations that match the content they're watching, though it won't be everywhere.</p><p>YouTube's AI has recently advanced, too, as the platform introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-labs-wants-you-to-test-the-future-of-ai-starting-with-music">a new Labs experiment for music</a>.

Both models sport AMOLED displays — 6.59 inches for the Find X9 and 6.78 inches for the Pro — each featuring a 120 Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of up to 3,600 nits.</p><p>On the optics side, the Find X9 Pro boasts a 200MP telephoto sensor with 3× periscope zoom. It also supports an optional detachable teleconverter lens for up to 10× native optical zoom, a first for OPPO. The regular Find X9 still holds its own with a triple 50MP rear setup, offering much of the same imaging prowess without costing extra.</p><p>Design-wise, the phones feel premium yet distinctive. The Find X9 series features flat edges and aluminum frames that give them a modern look. OPPO also introduced new colorways — the Find X9 comes in Velvet Red, Space Black, and Titanium Grey, while the Pro model offers Silk White and Titanium Charcoal. Both are built tough with IP68 and IP69 water- and dust-resistance ratings, so they can handle spills and splashes.</p><h2 id="smart-shortcut-2">Smart shortcut</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="emP2ow4MrmYK9GNomwEEV9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/emP2ow4MrmYK9GNomwEEV9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A new hardware addition, the Snap Key, lets users instantly trigger key functions like the camera or AI features.

The publication alleges that this "battery increase" isn't for the buds themselves, but for the charging case.</p><p>The post suggests that Samsung is looking to increase the Galaxy Buds Pro 4 case battery to roughly 530mAh.</p><p>For reference, and as the publication also notes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro's</a> charging case is only 15mAh lower, at 515mAh. So, while this alleged increase is "higher" number-wise, it might not drastically change how much extra power consumers can get. Although an increase might just work, no matter what it looks like. On the other side, rumors allege that Samsung is progressing through its Galaxy Buds 4 series development in order to meet its quick launch date.</p><p>There are theories that Samsung wants to launch the Galaxy Buds 4 series alongside the Galaxy S26 series early next year.</p><h2 id="no-time-to-linger-2">No time to linger</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="x4u2pJnsewSVLbRevMUtcN" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-with-gw7-buds-control.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4u2pJnsewSVLbRevMUtcN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot more to unravel about the potential that is the Galaxy Buds 4 series, as recent rumors claim Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/amid-one-ui-8-5-leaks-alleged-galaxy-buds-4-pro-testing-begins-rumor">started its software development</a>. This rumor cropped up during the One UI 8.5 streak in September, where a tipster allegedly discovered the early test build for the new earbuds. It looks like Samsung is preparing to debut the buds with the upcoming One UI 8.5 software, which sort of lines up with the latest rumors today.</p><p>The code suggests that consumers would see two iterations: a Buds 4 and a Buds 4 Pro, but nothing more was discovered. For that, we'll have to look elsewhere, deeper in One UI 8.5's code.</p><p>Tipsters <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/leaked-galaxy-buds-4-icon-one-ui-8-5-another-new-look-for-samsung">diving into the software's early code</a> reportedly discovered a redesign for the Galaxy Buds 4 through a listed icon. It looks like Samsung could move away from the Buds' current design, which leans on Apple's AirPods take, for something different. The icon shows a bud with a silicon tip, a rounded body, but a "detached" stem. Instead of the current series, which has its main body and stem seamlessly integrated, the Galaxy Buds 4 could see the stem "attached" onto the body for visible separation.</p><p>Other than this icon, there's nothing else about the buds to go on, so take this with a grain of salt for now.</p><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>When is the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 4 release date?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are widely rumored to launch in early 2026, likely debuting alongside the flagship Galaxy S26 series at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of the year (expected around January or February 2026).</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

The company calls this a "core update," one that brings a more natural conversation experience between the user and the AI. Consumers won't have any extra price tags for this, as it's simply a change in AI.</p><p>To access Gemini's new Home assistance, users can continue using the "Hey Google" wake-up voice line. The post states users can say this command to their connected speakers or display device and find "richer answers, set and edit reminders, stream media, and control your smart home..."</p><p>If you're looking to leverage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">Gemini Live's</a> intelligence, users must say, "Hey Google, let's chat." This will open up a new level of the AI's assistance to help users "deepen their knowledge" on a range of complex topics. Users can ask about VR, understand articles online, or even help their kids with their homework.</p><p>Gemini Live in this Home upgrade can also help parents figure out the perfect meals for their picky little eaters and even practice some public speaking.</p><h2 id="get-the-door-it-s-gemini-2">Get the door, it's Gemini</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="VDpryrWxWZW4R5bFHAZ6Kf" name="google-nest-gemini-doorbell-hazel" alt="The new Google Nest Doorbell (3rd Gen) in hazel up against a door." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VDpryrWxWZW4R5bFHAZ6Kf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside of the multiple (100 things to try) prompts and queries users have with Gemini, the AI's smart home capabilities leap forward. As the early access test rolls out today, users can utilize the AI to scroll back through their camera history and create new automations without touching their phones. However, you will need the Google Home Premium subscription to do such tasks.</p><p>If you enrolled previously, then you should notice these new goodies today. If you haven't, and you're interested, users must <strong>open Google Home (v4.1 or higher) > Tap Settings > Tap "Early Access."</strong> There is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Top-Questions-amp-Answers-about-Gemini-for-Home-Google-Home-Premium-and/ba-p/750844">an extensive walk-through</a> of information, as well as Google's supported devices for this test for users.</p><p>What's interesting is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/invites-for-google-gemini-for-home-arriving-for-some-android-users">we were hearing reports</a> of Gemini for Home appearing for some users earlier in October. Users on Reddit reported receiving the email about the test's appearance, though some features were missing, despite users having the required subscription. So, perhaps, these were the early instances of the test rolling out, and Google's now pushing it more officially to enrolled testers.</p><p>Either way, Gemini for Home is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-here-new-nest-cameras-ai-home-speaker-debut">positioned as a major overhaul</a> for the smart home experience with Google. Gemini's involvement brings punchier helpfulness to users looking to scrub back through their camera feeds, check their Home Brief, and loads more, as revealed at the beginning of the month.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The reason behind this potential price hike is that, according to the publication, Samsung is running into a "shortage" of available DRAM for mobile devices and computers.</p><p>This shortage is reportedly the result of a sharp rise in HBM (high-bandwidth memory) production used for AI servers.</p><p>There's more to this, as the publication states HBM is "more than five times more profitable than standard DRAM." Samsung has moved significantly into this HBM production world, crafting the necessary components to sustain the rise of AI and AI servers. While producing more HBM is seemingly more "profitable" for Samsung (and other companies), it's left its DRAM high and dry with its required resources.</p><p>What appears like a neglect in DRAM production will reportedly directly affect Samsung's phones, but only its "low to mid-priced phones." Going by that, perhaps Galaxy A series and below could take a hit, though it's unclear if future FE phones could see similar price hikes.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-got-to-make-changes-2">Samsung's got to make changes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4136px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bMGNgaiDpvBLRBkV4yca2Y" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-06" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus face down on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bMGNgaiDpvBLRBkV4yca2Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4136" height="2326" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As far as Android is concerned, the DRAM problem is worrying; however, Samsung's efforts in ramping up HBM are causing price hikes for SSDs.</p><p>For now, it seems consumers can breathe easy about a potential price increase for future Galaxy S series phones, something we did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-was-smart-not-to-raise-the-price-of-the-galaxy-s25-ultra">when the Galaxy S25 launched</a>, too. Earlier this year, it was made evident that Samsung didn't drop a price hike on the S25 series, notably the S25 Ultra, like speculation previously theorized. This was a good thing as the Ultra already carries quite a hefty $1,299 price tag, like the S24 Ultra when it launched.</p><p>It's important to note that the S24 Ultra saw a $100 increase over the S23 Ultra, but a representative informed Android Central that the cost matched the improvements. They said in a statement, "Over the last three years, we have added and improved Ultra dramatically, and we have prided ourselves in providing an absolute best value that we can to our customers."</p><p>Perhaps, with what's going on with Samsung's current DRAM shortage, the company is looking to recoup those costs elsewhere, without forcing it on its Galaxy S. We are expecting the Galaxy S26 series next year; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/when-will-samsung-launch-the-galaxy-s26-one-leaker-claims-itll-be-later-than-usual">it might've been delayed</a>. New rumors claim the S26 series could debut in March 2026, not January.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you prefer to buy your phones unlocked and can wait a few more weeks, it might be worth waiting to see what retailers like Amazon and Best Buy do with the Pixel 9a. The phone dropped to $364 during October Prime Day, for instance, and I wouldn't be surprised if it hit that same record low again when the Black Friday sales begin in earnest.</p><p>On the other hand, if you're already a T-Mobile subscriber and you don't mind adding a new line to your wireless service, then this Google Pixel 9a deal is a truly unmissable opportunity that no Black Friday sale can touch. </p><h2 id="when-is-black-friday-2025-2">When is Black Friday 2025?</h2><p>Black Friday historically falls on the day after Thanksgiving in the United States, which means the 2025 event is set to occur on November 28th. That sale will be followed by Cyber Monday on December 1st, and you can expect that entire weekend to be packed full of various sale events. </p><h2 id="when-does-the-google-pixel-10a-come-out-2">When does the Google Pixel 10a come out?</h2><p>We've been following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-10a">leaks and rumors surrounding the Pixel 10a</a> for months now, and our sources indicate that the latest midrange masterpiece from Google will likely be unveiled in March 2026. This phone will probably boast the same $500 price tag as past A-series Pixel releases, plus it's sure to be equipped with the Tensor G5 chipset, great cameras, and all of the latest AI software features. Is it worth waiting six more months to buy the new Pixel 10a? The choice is yours, but I'd say that the Google Pixel 9a is a worthy investment in the meantime. </p> ]]></dc:content>

And we could be looking at a major leap in technology that may redefine flagship performance, although it’s supposedly bringing a painful price hike along for the ride.</p><p>The chip in question is the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6, reportedly codenamed SM8975. Reliable leaker Digital Chat Station said on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/QbdJd0Dv1" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that Qualcomm is apparently skipping straight to TSMC's most advanced 2nm manufacturing process, N2P (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-6-leak-3610819/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>To put that in perspective, the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> chip — which powers top-tier phones like the Xiaomi 17 and OnePlus 15 — is built on a 3nm process. By jumping directly to the refined N2P node, Qualcomm is bypassing the first-gen N2 process entirely.</p><p>The N2P process represents TSMC’s second-generation 2nm technology, and it’s already looking impressive on paper. Compared to the N3E node (used for the 3nm-based Snapdragon 8 Elite), N2P promises up to 18% better performance or 36% lower power consumption.</p><p>It also packs around 1.15x the chip density of the current 3nm N3E process, allowing for more transistors in the same space. Simply put, this is the kind of tech shift that could redefine what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagships</a> can do over the next few years.</p><h2 id="a-full-platform-overhaul-2">A full platform overhaul</h2><p>Qualcomm is also planning to add support for LPDDR6 RAM and UFS 5.0 storage in the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6. These upgrades should make phones faster and more efficient.</p><p>The new memory and storage standards are also designed with AI-driven tasks in mind, so they may come in handy for the increasingly machine-learning-heavy world of Android software and camera systems.</p><p>Now for the bad news. This cutting-edge technology is expensive. DCS says the cost of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6 chip itself is expected to increase greatly. That cost won't be eaten by the manufacturers. It will be passed directly to you.</p><p>So, while the next generation of elite smartphones is poised to be incredibly powerful, those eye-watering prices are only going to get higher.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While Black Friday sales in the past tended to end at midnight that night, many events now last through the weekend and into Cyber Monday (December 1st). Needless to say, I'll be hard at work sharing the best deals that entire weekend, so be sure to watch our site for all of the latest shopping advice from yours truly.</p><h2 id="what-samsung-galaxy-deals-should-i-expect-during-black-friday-2">What Samsung Galaxy deals should I expect during Black Friday?</h2><p>Samsung's entire fleet of Galaxy devices is likely to be discounted in the days leading up to Black Friday, so keep your eyes peeled for deals on the S25 series of smartphones, the Galaxy Watch 8, new Samsung tablets, and so much more.</p><h2 id="should-i-buy-a-samsung-galaxy-phone-today-or-wait-until-black-friday-2">Should I buy a Samsung Galaxy phone today or wait until Black Friday?</h2><p>It depends. Are you seeking a straight, no-strings discount on an unlocked device? If so, I'd probably wait, as the Black Friday deals are certain to get better in the coming weeks.</p><p>On the other hand, if you're looking for a trade-in opportunity or upgrade deal from your wireless provider, it's unlikely that carrier deals will get much better than they are right now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication also notes that the Pixel 10a will be the same size as the Pixel 9a, measuring 153.9 x 72.9 x 9mm.</p><p>So far, we know that Google would be sticking to a similar $499 price range for its next budget phone, considering Google aims to keep this series as affordable as possible.

Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV" name="lloyd-should-you-buy_720" caption="" alt="Lloyd going shopping!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">So many tech products!

Should you think about buying one?</p><p>Enjoy our content? Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-speaker">smart speaker</a> is undoubtedly a niche product. If you only want <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Google Gemini</a> to answer questions or execute your commands, your phone can do that, so you don't need one. Likewise for your music. There are many ways to pipe music into a room, and some sound a lot better than any smart speaker can.</p><p>The lure is the <em>combination</em> of the two. Gemini tells you about your day every morning, transitions to playing your latest playlist from YouTube Music or Spotify, and lets you know whether you should take an umbrella to work. One unit that does everything can be handy.</p><p>Even more so if you have other smart home devices. Yelling "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-led-light-bulbs-work-google-home">Turn On The Lights!</a>" into a dark room or having an electronic butler of sorts adjust the thermostat when you're chilly is both fun and useful. A smart speaker does all that and more, too.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KUvdfm8C8Vt5XVjLzaqTkS" name="google home smart speaker 2025" alt="Google Home smart speaker 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KUvdfm8C8Vt5XVjLzaqTkS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Home Speaker isn't here yet, so saying whether you should buy it is impossible. But it's never too early to think about what you might want to get next. Based on what we know today, there are several good reasons you might want one.</p><p><strong>It will have a great price tag</strong>. Google says the Google Home Speaker will launch at $99. It's easy to spend 99 bucks on things that will never be useful, so seeing a price this low is welcome.</p><p><strong>It's designed to be conversational</strong>. Google says a big part of the new experience will be naturally talking to your smart speaker. As a user of smart home devices, this is a welcome change. You can get one to do anything as long as you ask the "right way," now, and I'll admit sometimes that "right way" seems silly.</p><p><strong>It supports virtual 360-degree audio</strong>. Cramming four or more speakers into a plastic box sounds like speakers crammed into a plastic box without proper audio processing. The right <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-android-users-need-know-about-spatial-audio">spatial audio support</a> can make the Google Home Speaker sound a lot better, even if it doesn't rival a true home audio setup. Here's hoping it's great.</p><p><strong>It will pair with the Google TV Streamer</strong>. Just $300 ($100 for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">TV Streamer</a> and two Google Home Speakers at $100 each) will give you a ready-made home theater system, and that's a big deal. Providing everything works as promised, the setup is easy and wireless, and the total cost will be less than the price of some single home theater speakers that require hard wiring. This genuinely has me excited since I'm not ever going to run wires or spend a bunch of money on the bedroom.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6917px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XnrU9cCJ5fuzWkiZz6oiWY" name="google-home-speaker-gemini-black-option-countertop" alt="The Google Home Speaker in black, sitting on a countertop while a model walks by." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XnrU9cCJ5fuzWkiZz6oiWY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6917" height="3891" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned, we don't know a lot about the product and how it will fall short of expectations. I promise it will in at least a few ways, but we do have Google's history in the smart home to consider.</p><p>Specifically, support. Google loves to improve its products, which often means things that still work great get left behind. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast-audio-being-discontinued">Chomecast Audio</a> and older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-is-dropping-support-for-the-first-two-generations-of-nest-learning-thermostat">Nest Learning Thermostats</a> are prime examples.</p><p>As someone who is affected by this far more often than I would like, I have to mention it. As of today, the only supported Google Home products (according to Google itself) are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/should-you-buy-nest-aware-subscription-your-nest-camera">Nest Camera</a> (wired and battery)</li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">Nest Learning Thermostat</a> (4th gen), Nest Thermostat, Nest Temperature Sensor</li><li>Google Nest Hub, <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review">Google Nest Hub Max</a>, Google Nest Mini, Google Home Mini, Google Home, Google Home Max, <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-announces-nest-audio-google-home-successor-2020">Google Nest Audio</a>.</li></ul><p>That's a long list of products, but they all share one thing in common: they are relatively new (and possibly still a great buy right now with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-here-new-nest-cameras-ai-home-speaker-debut">Gemini support rolling out</a>). I have the original Google Home Mini here in a box in case I want to scavenge any parts from it, and I can tell you it worked as well on its last day as it did on its first. It was discontinued, then support was dropped simply to favor new products.</p><p>Google's not alone here, and this is the nature of technology. While $100 isn't a lot of money in 2025, it's also not something you want to throw away when the next shiny thing comes along.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>So, should you think about getting one? Yes, if you're entrenched in Google's ecosystem or a smart home fan.</p><p>I like the price and the supposed features. There's a lot of value there for anyone who wants Google Gemini in the room, "helping" during day-to-day life. The smart home factor alone makes it worth it for anyone whose disability means they need a helping hand from time to time.</p><p>I'm considering buying three myself. One on the table in the living room can do all those Gemini things, and I hate the audio on my bedroom television, but hate the idea of spending a lot of money or running wires. I'm currently using a Nest Hub with a bit of duct tape over the camera in the bedroom, so a setup with the Google Home Speakers can pull double duty.</p><p>I'm not telling you to buy a product I've never touched and that hasn't been released yet. I am saying there's a lot to think about here, especially when there are already several Google smart home speakers that you can buy right now.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>When will the Google Home Speaker be available?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The Google Home Speaker will be available in spring 2026, although Google has not specified when exactly it will hit stores. That said, we can assume Google may time the launch with its annual Google I/O developer conference.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Can you pair the Google Home Speaker with other devices?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Google has teased the ability to pair two Home Speakers and the Google TV Streamer, creating a home theater-like experience powered by Gemini.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Is Gemini available on current Google Nest hardware?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Google is making Gemini available on its current hardware, and as of writing, it is slowly rolling out to users as part of an early-access program.

Everything about Vanguard is made with workouts in mind, from the sweatproof design to the Garmin integration. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"><div class="list-pros-wrapper"><h4 class="list-pros-label">Pros</h4><ul class="list-pros"><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>12MP camera that can record 3K videos</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>IP67 rating against dust and water ingress</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Longer battery life with up to nine hours on a single charge</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Louder open-ear speakers compared to Ray-Ban Meta</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Meta AI, Strava, and Garmin Connect support</li></ul></div><div class="list-cons-wrapper"><h4 class="list-cons-label">Cons</h4><ul class="list-cons"><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Not as stylish or compact as Ray-Ban Meta</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>You can only use Garmin integration with certain workout types and watches</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>No option for Transitions or prescription lenses</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Pricey</li></ul></div></div>            </div>        </div><p>Meta was hard at work refreshing its smart glasses portfolio over the last few months, starting with the Oakley Meta HSTN launch in the summer. Then, it brought HSTN improvements to second-generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses and added Oakley Meta Vanguard to the lineup. You might be choosing between Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 and Oakley Meta Vanguard if you're a sporty user, but which one is best?</p><p>It's a complicated question, because Vanguard is better at one thing — improving your workouts — whereas Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 are clearly the more versatile option. As such, if you want a pair of smart glasses for everyday wear and the occasional workout, Ray-Ban will likely serve your needs best. On the flip side, if you need the best smart glasses for workouts, that's going to be Vanguard.</p><p>Let's compare all the differences between Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 and Oakley Meta Vanguard to help you decide.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-vs-oakley-meta-vanguard-pricing-and-availability-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Oakley Meta Vanguard: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VdUQBXAsNU2iGC4DaoMjp" name="Ray-Ban-Gen-2-close-up-with-case-top-down" alt="Close-up, top-down photo of the Shiny Cosmic Blue Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer glasses laying lenses up, arms down on an armrest, with the official brown Ray-Ban charging case behind it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VdUQBXAsNU2iGC4DaoMjp.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</a> smart glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">at Connect 2025</a>, and they're now widely available for purchase. You can buy Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) now online and at retail partners starting at $379. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a>, there are three different styles to choose from here: Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner. Additionally, prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00 are compatible.</p><p>By comparison, Oakley Meta Vanguard are a bit pricier, with a flat $499 price tag. There are a handful of Vanguard frame and lens colors, but the smart glasses only come in one style. While you can swap out the lenses as you please, you're stuck with the side colorway forever, so choose wisely. These smart glasses aren't available with prescription lenses. You can find them at Meta, Oakley, and partner retailers.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-vs-oakley-meta-vanguard-design-and-features-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Oakley Meta Vanguard: Design and features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xNEGWsXdX57MRnXNYWetqX" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-close-up-front" alt="A photo of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses sitting on a rock, close up of the front lenses and camera cutouts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xNEGWsXdX57MRnXNYWetqX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're familiar with Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses, it'll be helpful to know that the Gen 2 revision retains an identical frame design. Whether that's a good or bad thing might depend on whether you found the first-generation model comfortable or not. There are still Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles available, as well as large and regular sizes for Wayfarer. Ideally, there are a lot of frame options that'll help users find a good fit.</p><p>The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses did cut a bit of weight this generation, coming in at 48 grams. That's only a four-gram difference compared to Gen 1, but it's a bigger deal when you compare the smart glasses to the new Oakley Meta Vanguard. The latter weighs 66 grams, and while it does offer silicone nose pads for a better fit, Vanguard is still heavy.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wGkiaFuvNPR2F7VkBerQVe" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-on-trailhead" alt="The Oakley Meta Vanguard sitting atop a wooden trailhead with trees behind it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGkiaFuvNPR2F7VkBerQVe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then, there's the difference in look. Oakley Meta Vanguard has one singular curved lens that wraps around the sunglass frames. Of course, this is quite the contrast compared to the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2). That's amplified by the fact that there are no clear, prescription, or Transition lenses available for Vanguard. They're only available as sunglasses, though you can swap the lens color for a different one at a later date.</p><p>Vanguard are giant overall, sporting a hinge-to-hinge length of 136mm and a lens height of 59mm. Being that the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses are smaller and support polarized, clear, prescription, and Transition lenses, they'll fit in more places. They could also be more comfortable than Vanguard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nzjUrGrpqXGxzKKBTBfWkX" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-close-up-front-side" alt="A photo of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses sitting on a rock, angled to focus on the right camera cutout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nzjUrGrpqXGxzKKBTBfWkX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Notably, the Oakley Meta Vanguard has its camera in the center of the frame, which will provide a better POV-style recording perspective.

However, the Oakley Meta Vanguard does have a few tricks that other Meta smart glasses don't. For one, it offers the longest battery life, up to 9 hours on a single charge. Vanguard also has an IP67 rating for full dust and water-resistance, while the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) only have IPX4 certification.</p><p>Vanguard's speakers are six decibels louder than the ones inside Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), and Meta claims you can hear them in up to 30 MPH winds. Both glasses feature adaptive volume, which can raise and lower the volume dynamically when loud sounds pass by.</p><p>Additionally, Oakley Meta Vanguard is designed for workouts with Strava and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-garmin-integration-on-oakley-meta-vanguard-glasses-heres-good-bad-and-ugly">Garmin Connect integration</a>.

They're absolutely stellar for hiking, running, and working out, but it'd be impossible to pull them off in a coffee shop.</p><p>Naturally, that limits how often you'll feel comfortable wearing your $500 smart glasses, so you'll have to decide if the value proposition makes sense for your workout needs. Other concerns include weight and comfort — at well over 60 grams, Vanguard might feel unwieldy for those not used to wearing heavy shades while working out. If you can get past those limits, the Vanguard are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> for fitness buffs.</p><p>The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) are for everyone else. These smart glasses try to do it all and fit in during nearly all situations. That's evidenced by their classic Ray-Ban styles, which won't look out of place in a mall or restaurant. With Meta AI support, a 3K video camera, eight-hour battery life, and open-air speakers, the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) manage to deliver the same core tech as Vanguard while being more approachable.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5838b86f-44ff-44ad-b06a-773879c9e6c9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Drr6BvBvMgCFoowJyoiLHk.jpg' alt="An official product render of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses Wayfarer style with blue frames and blue lenses"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best for most</strong></em></p><p>Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 are the pinnacle of smart glasses, and they'll be able to handle a variety of situations, from casual wear to daily runs.

A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive update</a> tried to get fancy by replacing the alarm's solid background with your phone's wallpaper. It sounded cool, but in practice, it was a design mess.</p><p>Users quickly found their alarm time rendered in unreadable text over a background with similar color, which is exactly what you don't need when you're half-asleep and trying to stop a blaring noise.</p><p>Google heard the complaints. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/27/google-clock-8-3/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> reports that the new update walks back that change, and it’s a massive improvement for daily usability. The alarm screen now returns to a solid background, so your time, buttons, and stop/snooze controls are much easier to see. This tweak brings the interface closer to how it looked before the M3 Expressive redesign.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:773px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:109.06%;"><img id="4BzgfNAKstsvkGjfk5SSKe" name="Google-Clock-before-and-after" alt="Google Clock alarm screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4BzgfNAKstsvkGjfk5SSKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="773" height="843" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google Clock with a wallpaper background (left) versus a solid one (right) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="google-assistant-is-fading-2">Google Assistant is fading</h2><p>The update also includes a subtle branding shift that says a lot about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">Google’s current direction</a>. The Assistant label that used to appear under the alarm’s optional post-wake actions has been replaced with just “Routines.” Functionally, nothing has changed, but this move quietly detaches the feature from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>’s branding.</p><p>Furthermore, the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-clock-alarm-wallpaper-3610416/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> looked into the app’s code and found signs of a new “pulsing” clock animation coming soon.

And if the leaks are to be believed, the next Samsung foldable could bring serious upgrades to the lineup.</p><p>Samsung solved some of the biggest issues of the Galaxy Z Fold series with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Z Fold 7</a>. The company had been lagging behind competitors in terms of thickness, and the Z Fold 7 solved that with an 8.9mm profile when folded.</p><p>Samsung also managed to reduce the weight to match <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">slab-style flagships</a> while adding a more powerful processor and a brighter, wider outer display that mimics a traditional phone and now stretches closer to the edges.</p><p>However, despite the upgrades, Samsung didn't address (and even removed) a few features from the Z Fold 7. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-support-the-s-pen">dropped S Pen support</a> and didn't increase the battery capacity either. Now, it looks like the Galaxy Z Fold 8 might fix both while bringing other improvements.</p><h2 id="s-pen-support-could-make-a-comeback-2">S Pen support could make a comeback</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9EvtFQDoc5yYq6nmjzcSWT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-17" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9EvtFQDoc5yYq6nmjzcSWT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dealsite.co.kr/articles/150200">Dealsite</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1983015611186966618">Jukanlosreve on X/Twitter</a>), Samsung is planning to increase the Galaxy Z Fold 8's battery capacity to about 5,000 mAh next year. This should, on paper, deliver better battery life compared to the current Z Fold 7’s 4,400 mAh cell.</p><p>Another upgrade could be an even less noticeable display crease. The report claims Samsung will use a new "laser-drilling metal plate" technology to reduce the display crease further. There are also rumors of Apple planning to use the same tech for its foldable iPhone next year.</p><p>Additionally, the report mentions Samsung is planning to bring back S Pen support with the next Galaxy Z Fold. It's unclear how this will be implemented, given that Samsung removed the digitizer from the Z Fold 7 to minimize thickness, but the company is reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-will-reconsider-s-pen-return-galaxy-z-fold-7-ditched-it-report">working on an improved S Pen</a>, so we could see that.</p><p>On the whole, though, it seems Samsung isn't slowing down but instead building on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-hit-in-us">success of the Z Fold 7</a> to make the lineup even more appealing — especially with Apple's first foldable expected next year. Of course, a lot could change before its launch, expected around July 2026, but things are looking good for the Galaxy Z Fold 8 already.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google is rolling out a new experiment today aimed directly at small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that don't have a giant marketing budget or a dedicated design team. It’s called Pomelli, an AI marketing tool born from a partnership between Google Labs and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-leans-on-google-deepmind-transformative-image-edits-update">Google DeepMind</a>.</p><p>Pomelli is an AI-powered marketing tool built to help small businesses quickly generate polished, scalable campaigns that still feel authentic to their brand. Essentially, it's designed to learn your brand — its tone, style, and visual identity — before creating anything.</p><p>So, how does it work? Pomelli uses AI to understand your business and operates on a three-step process.</p><h2 id="it-learns-your-brand-s-dna-2">It learns your brand's DNA</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:805px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="KJzGJiZptabYv5VzFrZXX5" name="Google-Pomelli-business-DNA" alt="Google Pomelli business DNA screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KJzGJiZptabYv5VzFrZXX5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="805" height="452" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, it builds what Google calls your "Business DNA". You start by just giving it your website's URL. The AI then scans your site and existing images  to automatically pull out your brand's specific identity. This profile includes your brand's color palette, custom fonts, and existing images. It also analyzes the text to understand your "tone of voice".</p><p>This DNA profile becomes the foundation for everything the tool creates, which is supposed to keep all the content feeling consistent and "authentic" to your specific brand.</p><p>Once Pomelli has your brand’s DNA down, it starts generating custom campaign ideas. If you’ve ever hit a wall trying to brainstorm a new marketing angle, this step is a lifesaver. Pomelli offers tailored concepts you can instantly use or tweak based on your goals. And if you already have a vision, you can just type in a prompt and let the tool generate assets that match your idea.</p><h2 id="you-keep-control-2">You keep control</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:959px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.79%;"><img id="XvHc6KtPKmyrjRhDEKGSkB" name="Google-Pomelli-edit-tools" alt="editing tools within Pomelli" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvHc6KtPKmyrjRhDEKGSkB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="959" height="535" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The final step is where it all comes together. Pomelli produces a set of finished, high-quality marketing assets ready for use. We're talking stuff ready to be posted on your social media, used in your ads, or put on your site.</p><p>You can look through the different generated creatives  and, importantly, you aren't stuck with the first draft. The tool has built-in editors that let you change the text or tweak the images right inside the platform. When you're happy with an asset, you just download it and it's ready to go.</p><p>Pomelli is launching as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://labs.google/pomelli" target="_blank">public beta</a> starting today in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, available in English. Google says it’s still early days, so the team is looking for feedback to fine-tune the experience.</p> ]]></dc:content>
