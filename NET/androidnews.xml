<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google's plan to eliminate third-party cookie trackers has been postponed until next year.</li><li>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has raised concerns about Google's new technology, Privacy Sandbox, potentially favoring Google and disrupting competition.</li><li>This isn't the first time Google has postponed its cookie removal plan; it's the third delay since initially announcing the two-year timeline in January 2020.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s plan to get rid of third-party cookie trackers is on hold until next year.</p><p>Google has been pushing back on ditching third-party cookies several times now. This time, the search giant blames it on the industry and regulatory backlash. Google needs to get approval from the UK&apos;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) first, making sure its new tech called Privacy Sandbox isn&apos;t messing with competition.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-disable-third-party-cookies-some-chrome-users-2024">originally planned to ditch third-party cookies in Chrome by the end of this year</a>, but now it&apos;s aiming for early 2025. But it&apos;s not set in stone yet. Google is crossing its fingers that it can strike a deal with both the CMA and the Information Commissioner&apos;s Office (ICO) before it can really kick things off.</p><p>The CMA, in particular, is worried about what the deprecation will mean for Google&apos;s rivals and the industry as a whole.</p><p>Google has also been catching some flak from advertisers who are sweating over the idea of losing third-party cookies on the world&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">favorite browser</a>. They&apos;re concerned about what this could mean for their wallets.</p><p>The news about the delay arrives just before Google and the CMA drop their quarterly reports.</p><p>“We recognize that there are ongoing challenges related to reconciling divergent feedback from the industry, regulators and developers, and will continue to engage closely with the entire ecosystem,” Google said in a statement on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/update-on-the-plan-for-phase-out-of-third-party-cookies-on-chrome/" target="_blank">website</a> for the Privacy Sandbox. "It&apos;s also critical that the CMA has sufficient time to review all evidence including results from industry tests, which the CMA has asked market participants to provide by the end of June."</p><p>This isn&apos;t the first time Google has hit the pause button on its original plan. Back in January 2020, the company said it would ditch third-party cookies "within two years" to make web surfing safer for everyone. But this is the third time it has delayed it.</p><p>In 2022, the CMA said that axing those third-party cookies in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> would throw the competition off balance, giving Google an unfair edge. The regulators told the company to come up with a new plan that doesn&apos;t tip the scales in its favor.</p><p>Google has been trying to play nice and meet all the CMA&apos;s demands, but truth be told, it hasn&apos;t quite managed to iron out all the wrinkles yet.</p><p>With the vague promise of a 2025 launch, there&apos;s a ton of uncertainty swirling around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-to-test-restricting-third-party-cookies-soon-before-ditching-them-for-good">Google&apos;s effort to deprecate third-party cookies</a>. And honestly, it feels like we&apos;re all just waiting for the other shoe to drop.</p>

<ul><li>Google Messages introduced Screen Effects in February, adding over 15 visual effects triggered by specific keywords in messages.</li><li>An option to disable these animations seems to have surfaced in the latest version of the Messages app with a toggle in the settings called "Show expressive animations".</li><li>Previously, the only way to disable animations in Google Messages was to do it for all apps on the device.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you&apos;re tired of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-gain-one-billion-active-rcs-users">flashy new animations in Google Messages</a>, the platform might be adding a way to turn them off soon.</p><p>In February, Google Messages <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-starts-rolling-out-screen-effects">introduced Screen Effects to more users globally</a>. It was a neat little feature that added over 15 visual effects to your messages, triggered by certain keywords. So, if you texted "I Love You" to your loved one, you might see a big heart pop up on your screen.</p><p>However, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/24/google-messages-animations-off/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, many users were asking for a way to turn off these animations. Well, it looks like their wish might have been granted with the latest version of the Messages app (v20240422_01_RC00).</p><p>In the app&apos;s settings, there&apos;s a toggle called "Show expressive animations" that controls both <em>Reaction </em>and <em>Screen Effects</em>. Until now, the only option to disable animations in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a> was to do it for all apps on your device, which could be a hassle if you only wanted to disable them in Messages.</p><p>For some users, it&apos;s essential to turn off animations, specifically in Messages. Given how often those reactions and screen effects pop up and take over your screen when you&apos;re typing certain phrases or using specific emojis, it can get pretty distracting.</p><p>The big problem with these animations is that the words triggering them are everyday language we use a lot. Who wants a bunch of colorful thumbs-up fingers popping up every time you say or get a "Sounds Good" message? It&apos;s a bit too much.</p><p>Google might have gone a bit overboard with those animations, though the new way to opt out should be welcome news for users who find the current animations too distracting or just not their thing. Having more control over the app&apos;s user experience is always a welcome change.</p><p>That said, this feature is still a work in progress, so it might take a while before it&apos;s available to everyone. Also, we&apos;re not sure if this toggle will also impact animated emojis, which are a different feature altogether.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While most of the exciting innovation in the storage industry is focused on SSDs, mechanical hard drives aren&apos;t left behind — far from it. Seagate in particular has consistently delivered HDDs with ever-increasing capacities, and the Exos X24 sits at the top of the summit. The drive debuted at the end of last year, and is the flagship offering in the Exos X24 series, which goes from 12TB to 24TB.</p><p>All the drives in the Exos X24 series are based on conventional magnetic recording (CMR) tech, and Seagate also has custom models that use shingled magnetic recording (SMR), with these going up to 28TB. But Seagate isn&apos;t selling those drives to retail customers, and is instead making them available to its enterprise clients.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jubWPN9jqKeLdZDnVh3aum" name="seagate-exos-x24-2.jpg" alt="Seagate Exos X24 24TB HDD review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jubWPN9jqKeLdZDnVh3aum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to the consumer Exos series, the 12TB version of the Exos X24 starts off at $318, the 16TB drive retails for $360, the 20TB is $409, and the 24TB HDD that I&apos;m reviewing (ST24000NM002H) is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Exos-Enterprise-Internal-Drive/dp/B0CM293XCL">available for $479 on Amazon</a>. I&apos;m using the variant with the standard 6Gbps SATA interface, and Seagate also has a dual-port 12Gbps SAS option available.</p><p>Having <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/seagate-exos-x20-20tb-nas-hdd-review">used the 20TB Exos X20</a> extensively over the course of the last year, the main difference with the X24 is that it has a 512MB cache buffer (up from 256GB). The 24TB drive has 10 2.4TB platters, and only the heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR)-based Exos Mozaic 3+ has a better density in Seagate&apos;s portfolio, offering 3TB platters.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PbgtgGahVXaUVo8dFGb8rn" name="seagate-exos-x24-7.jpg" alt="Seagate Exos X24 24TB HDD review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PbgtgGahVXaUVo8dFGb8rn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rest of the numbers are in line with the X20 series; the 24TB Exos X24 spins at 7200RPM, has a 550TB/year workload rating, 2.5 million hour MTBF (mean time between failures), sustained transfers of 285MB/s, and 168/550 random read/write IOPS. And like other Exos models, the X24 comes with an extended warranty that covers any issues up to five years.</p>

<p>The Exos X24 drives are helium-filled, and this allows better density as the platters can be thinner; this is how Seagate was able to fit 10 platters into the Exos X24 — regular HDDs feature up to six platters. These drives generate less noise and heat, and they withstand vibrations a little better than traditional HDDs. That&apos;s why most high-density HDDs these days use a helium-sealed enclosure.</p>

<p>I used the Exos X24 24TB for just over two months now in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">DiskStation DS1823xs+</a>, and it has been terrific. The drive is technically designed for data center use, but if you&apos;re running an enthusiast server and need to store a lot of data, it is one of the best options right now. I ran the Exos X24 alongside the 20TB Exos X20 and a 22TB IronWolf Pro, and it runs a little cooler under load. I managed transfers of 254MB/s on average, and that is more than what the 20TB and 22TB drives delivered.</p><p>Seagate also makes a 24TB version of the IronWolf Pro, and while these continue to be among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-long-lasting-hard-drives-nas-synology-qnap">best NAS HDDs</a> available, the Exos X24 is a better choice. It tends to be noisier during sustained reads and writes, but it isn&apos;t considerably more so than the IronWolf Pro, and in daily usage scenarios, the drive isn&apos;t audible.</p>

<p>Coming in at $479 for the 24TB drive, the Exos X24 costs $19.95 per terabyte, and while this is higher than the $16.6/TB that the 18TB Exos X18 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-ST18000NM000J-Internal-Surveillance-Supported/dp/B08K98VFXT">retailing for as of writing</a>, you are getting much better storage density.</p><p>Ultimately, the 24TB Exos X24 is your best option if you want an HDD with a large capacity and outstanding performance. With Seagate switching gears to HAMR tech and focusing on drives like the Mozaic 3+, the Exos X24 is the default choice if you want a CMR drive with high storage potential and proven reliability.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Calendar's Android app now includes a dropdown menu beneath the current month's view, offering quick access to navigation chips for seamless month switching.</li><li>Users can preview up to four months ahead and easily scroll left or right to select a desired month.</li><li>Despite being part of a specific app version, the update is likely rolled out server-side, ensuring widespread availability.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Calendar just ironed out a pesky little annoyance we&apos;ve often faced when planning months ahead. The Android app now makes switching between months a breeze with new navigation chips.</p><p>On one of our devices with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-calendar">Google Calendar</a> (version 2024.13.1-624115131-release) installed, there&apos;s a new dropdown below the current month&apos;s view. Tapping on it brings up a row of chips that allow you to jump between months on the go.</p><p>You can check out about four months ahead (but it might vary based on how big your screen is), and you can scroll left or right to pick a month quickly, whether it&apos;s in the future or the past.</p><p>The change was first spotted by former Android Police editor Manuel Vonau, who noticed these chips in the Schedule view on the app (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/04/24/google-calendar-months-chips-android-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). You can find them snugly nestled between the monthly calendar and the agenda list. The same is true for the <em>Day </em>and <em>Week </em>views.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google Calendar just added month chips for me below the month section in the agenda view 👀 I bet it's server-side, but I'm on version 2024.13.1-624115131-release pic.twitter.com/xbZ1hYKxlw<a href="https://twitter.com/ManuelVonau/status/1783200919208812982">April 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-label="See more">See more</span></div></div>
<p>As you can see in the screenshots below, the chips do take up a bit of space in those views, but it&apos;s not really a big deal given how small they are. Meanwhile, the chips are located right above the dates in the <em>Month </em>view.</p>

<p>This new bar seems to let you scroll all the way ahead, so you can zoom into the future by years, or even decades, in a flash.</p><p>While the feature is present in version 2024.13.1-624115131-release, Vonau points out that it&apos;s likely a server-side update.</p><p>The Calendar app already lets you swipe left and right to move through the months, but these new chips make it way easier to hop to a particular month.</p><p>Chips <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-unveils-update-to-ai-chip">play a big role in the Android experience</a>.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-17">What you need to know</h2>

<hr>
<p>After a rather exciting week for the company, Meta announced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2024/Meta-Reports-First-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx">Q1 2024 financial earnings</a> on Wednesday, revealing rather impressive numbers despite a worrying forecast. Revenue was up year over year to $36.45 billion, led mostly by Meta&apos;s Family of Apps and increased ad spend. However, VR also played a role, thanks to improved Quest sales.</p><p>Reality Labs, Meta&apos;s division focused on VR and AR, was up by 30% as a result of sales of its VR headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a>, despite continuing to bleed cash. The division lost more than $3.8 billion during the quarter as the company continues to invest in its platform. Just this past week, Meta announced that it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">expanding the Meta Horizon OS</a> to third-party headsets, which should not only expand the company&apos;s offerings but open it up to more types of headsets.</p><p>We expect to see headsets from companies like Lenovo and ASUS ROG, and there will even be an Xbox-inspired headset.</p><p>"I think that our first-party Quest devices will continue to be the most popular headsets, as we see today," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the earnings call. "And we&apos;ll continue focusing on advancing the state-of-the-art tech and then making it accessible to everyone, but I also think that opening our ecosystem and opening our operating system will help the overall mixed reality ecosystem grow even faster."</p><p>But beyond VR, Meta has also increased its investments in AI, which is an area the company hopes will expand throughout its products. Recently, Meta announced its improved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Llama 3 model</a>, which can now be accessed via Meta AI on apps such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.</p><p>"We are also starting to see our AI initiatives increasingly overlap with our Reality Labs," Zuckerberg added, highlighting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update">new AI capabilities</a> rolling out on the well-received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>. With this update, users will be able to make video calls and perform multimodal searches, which incorporate voice and visuals to help users learn about what&apos;s around them.</p><p>This essentially means Meta has two major investments going forward as it looks to bolster its VR platform and its position in the ongoing AI race. As a result, and adding in other factors like an upcoming trial over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/paxton-sues-facebook-using-unauthorized-biometric-data">facial recognition tech</a>, the company expects a more modest Q2 as we begin to see these strategies take shape.</p><p>Despite this, Meta says it will "invest significantly more in infrastructure over the coming years" to support its AI ambitions, which will be crucial as companies like Google and Microsoft continue to inject their AI models across their products and services.</p>

<ul><li>HMD has debuted its first original lineup of phones under the "Pulse" series.</li><li>The trio features the same Unisoc T606 CPU and Android 14.

<hr>
<p>HMD Global announces the launch of its "first original" trio of devices dubbed the Pulse series.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_int/press/hmd-pulse-press-release">press release</a>, HMD states the new Pulse series is the beginning of its commitment to bring self-repairable devices to consumers. Under the "Gen 1 repairability" title, the company adds its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hmd.com/en_us/self-repair">partnership with iFixit</a> should help users quickly find the parts they need if anything goes wrong.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1685px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="qGeEYEg45sCmaujaHr8tU4" name="hmd-pulse-pro-purple-hue.jpg" alt="The HMD Pulse Pro model in a purple hue." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qGeEYEg45sCmaujaHr8tU4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1685" height="948" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: hm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The HMD Pulse Pro leads the trio with a 6.6-inch HD+ display. The back of the phone contains a vertical dual camera array featuring a 50 MP AF Dual camera and a 2MP depth sensor. HMD states consumers will find a Super Night and Tripod mode alongside Flash Shot and AI HDR.</p><p>The company adds that the Pulse Pro&apos;s AI Super Portrait mode should help reduce any blurring found during nighttime shots. The front of the device offers a 50MP selfie camera, as well.</p><p>Powering the device is the Unisoc T606 CPU. Additionally, consumers can grab 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. The phone supports microSD expansion of up to 256GB.</p><p>HMD packed a 5,000mAh battery into the Pulse Pro, which is estimated to last up to 59 hours and is capable of 20W fast charging. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> will greet users out of the box. HMD states it has committed to providing the device, and the rest of the series, with two years of OS updates.</p><p>The HMD Pulse Pro will be available soon in international markets in Glacier Green, Twilight Purple, and Black Ocean.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1785px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.97%;"><img id="yDvSDvHs3ALGiq8DfPKiRm" name="hmd-pulse-plus-model-blue.jpg" alt="The HMD Pulse Plus in a blue colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yDvSDvHs3ALGiq8DfPKiRm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1785" height="767" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HMD)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the HMD Pulse Plus, consumers will see the same 6.6-inch HD Plus display with a 90Hz refresh rate as the Pulse Pro. However, the Pulse Plus comes with a lower 8MP front-facing selfie camera. The device&apos;s sleek back panel contains a vertical dual camera array with a 50MP AF Dual Camera and a depth sensor to help "snap quality pictures with ease."</p><p>Interestingly, HMD has kept the same Unisoc T606 CPU for the Pulse Plus, like its Pro sibling. Internally, the device will offer 4GB of RAM, 128GB of internal storage, and up to 256GB of expandable storage via microSD.</p><p>Those interested in the HMD Pulse Plus will find the same 5,000mAh battery inside, though it features slower 10W charging capabilities.</p><p>This model is available now in Apricot Crush, Midnight Blue, and Glacier Green.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1791px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.96%;"><img id="F8XwFccGgXyXyJvk8PgdcX" name="hmd-pulse-vanilla-model-pink.jpg" alt="The HMD Pulse model in Dreamy Pink." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F8XwFccGgXyXyJvk8PgdcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1791" height="859" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HMD)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The last of the trio, the HMD Pulse, remains the same in terms of CPU and display capabilities. The smallest sibling differs with its dual camera array as the device offers a 13 MP AF Dual camera. The front selfie camera remains the same at 8MP.</p><p>HMD has packed the same battery as the Pulse Plus inside the vanilla model with 10W charging and an estimated 59-hour runtime.</p><p>The base model drops slightly for memory and storage as HMD puts it up with 4GB of RAM and only 64GB of internal storage. The device still retains its microSD slot, capable of holding up to 256GB of extra storage.</p><p>Much like the Plus model, the HMD Pulse is available now for international markets. Consumers can find it in Dreamy Pink, Meteor Black, and Atmos Blue colorways.</p><p>While HMD&apos;s initial trio of devices are only for overseas countries, the company informed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/hmd-pulse-pro/">Android Police</a> that it will bring one to the U.S. While specifics weren&apos;t given, it was stated that U.S. consumers will receive the "HMD Vibe," a play-off the HMD Pulse and Pulse Plus models. The device will reportedly go for $149 whenever it finally arrives.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google-backed Indian startup Glance is preparing to finally make its U.S. debut, bringing a unique lock screen experience to Android.</p><p>Unnamed sources reportedly told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/23/india-glance-pilots-android-lockscreen-platform-in-us/">TechCrunch</a> that Glance has started a "pilot program" with Motorola and Verizon in the U.S. Glance works to deliver recommendations to users like ads, news articles, and more on the lock screen. Sources state the company&apos;s platform does not collect or use user data.</p><p>Instead, Glance operates off a user&apos;s "patterns" in order for the software to operate.</p><p>Moreover, the platform is supposedly discussing ways to build an AI-backed lock screen experience with Qualcomm. Such a move would help Glance reduce the amount of data it requires to function while also moving to on-device processing.</p><p>With Glance moving into the U.S. from India, there are plans to collaborate with telecom operators, CNN, and the NBA. The lock screen experience will reportedly arrive "later this year."</p><p>A statement from Glance to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/lock-screen-ads-coming-to-android-phone/#update-2024-04-24-08-09-est-by-rajesh-pandey">Android Authority</a> says the company "does not intend" to ads on consumer devices in the U.S. Glance will side with offering a subscription service where users can pay for "premium news" on their lock screens every month.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that users will have the ability to disable Glance on their device once it officially arrives.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Glance regarding more information surrounding its subscription service. We did not hear back in time for publication but will update this article once we hear back.</p>

<p>The pilot program source alluded to for Glance in the U.S. has already arrived on some devices, including the Moto G Power 5G. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G 2024 review</a>, Glance&apos;s appearance on the device was questionable at best, and it felt a little intrusive. What&apos;s more, the platform tosses news recommendations at you, which seems a little redundant, considering Google&apos;s Discovery page is a swipe away from your home screen.</p><p>Fortunately, you can disable Glance on the phone, but we found that the service would occasionally produce a full-screen prompt on the lock screen, encouraging you to re-enable the feature.</p><p>We first heard about Glance in 2022, and it&apos;s not entirely clear what&apos;s taken the company so long to arrive in the U.S. It was stated two years ago that the company amassed 400 million users before it set eyes on the U.S. market.</p><p>Glance will seek to make a profit through the aforementioned subscription and if users interact with its "product of the day."</p>

<hr>
<p>A recent report suggests Google will upgrade its Gemini Nano AI model in time to roll out with Samsung&apos;s Galaxy S25 series next year.</p><p>The report stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://v.daum.net/v/20240417104601886">Daum Herald Economy</a> (Korean) following an interview with Samsung&apos;s executive director of systems, Cho Cheol-min (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s25-gemini-nano-2-ai-features-3436802/">Android Authority</a>). It was stated that discussions between Samsung and Google have already started as the brands look to "evolve" on-device AI in the next trio.</p><p>Cho stated, "We have started discussing how to implement version 2 of Google’s ‘Gemini Nano’ in on-device AI." He added that Samsung would have a "private" meeting with the company to discuss how they could further develop AI for the Galaxy S25.</p><p>Samsung continues to focus on its AI efforts, with Cho reportedly expressing how AI has allowed consumers to "actually experience AI." The company feels that phones are a better outlet than PCs for users to experience AI&apos;s capabilities.</p><p>Cho stated that the company is looking to double the number of people working toward on-device AI capabilities through its Exynos chipset. He stated around 200 people are involved in developing on-device AI for Exynos. He hopes that number reaches 400 "within the year."</p><p>Additionally, Samsung&apos;s executive director teased the possibility of a solution that blends on-device AI with cloud-based AI services.</p>

<p>For context, Google&apos;s Gemini Nano model is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">the smallest of the three</a> the company created. Nano is designed to handle the smaller, on-device tasks efficiently. The model was designed with the intention of landing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, which Google turned and did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-feature-drop-december-2023">with its Pixel 8 series</a>.</p><p>Samsung&apos;s Galaxy AI leverages Gemini Nano and Gemini Pro&apos;s LLM (large language model) to help users with their on-device tasks. However, the company piggybacks off Qualcomm&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC to do the heavy lifting, making such AI capabilities possible. Rumors suggest Samsung is interested in boosting its Exynos chip&apos;s AI capabilities, which could occur on the Exynos 2500.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-2500-soc-specs-leak">some information about Samsung&apos;s next chip leaked</a>, highlighting a likely increase in speed and performance.

We&apos;ve seen smartphones widely adopt 120Hz displays in the past few years, while the PC gaming side of things has seen monitors launch at 360Hz and beyond. But the refresh rate you see with your eyes isn&apos;t the only refresh rate you should care about.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a> recently launched with a PWM refresh rate of 4,320Hz, eclipsing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-90-and-magic-5-pro-display-benefits">previous record Honor set</a> with the Honor 90 and Honor Magic 5 Pro last Summer. That number is becoming more and more important as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">ultra-bright phone displays</a> are becoming more common, helping to alleviate eye strain when using these phones in bed at night.</p><p>But while an increasing number of companies are starting to advertise elevated PWM refresh rates, very few of them are willing to talk about the technology behind the glass. It&apos;s great to see attention paid to a topic that could affect millions of smartphone users, but it&apos;s also frustrating to see a lack of transparency from the companies behind the change movement.</p>

<p>Industrial espionage is a term for a reason. Companies that develop complicated, profit-making products don&apos;t want to reveal their secrets to the rest of the world to be easily copied. That problem has accelerated tenfold in an era where products can be cloned on production lines and sold under a random brand name on Amazon.</p><p>In just the past two years, we&apos;ve seen substantial competition in the display market from names like BOE, China Star, and Visionox, names you may have never even heard of until this article. Until these companies came along, an OLED panel on your favorite device was almost assuredly made by Samsung or LG.</p><p>However, Samsung&apos;s dominance in the AMOLED market meant that any decisions the company made ultimately trickled down to companies using Samsung displays in their products. As any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> person will tell you, Samsung AMOLED panels are the worst type of display for eye health.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Honor uses a BOE panel that gets to 5,000 nits brightness under the right conditions, yet it uses fascinating technology to ensure it's not searing your retinas.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Unironically, none of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-phones-for-pwm-flicker-sensitive">best phones for PWM-sensitive people</a> have displays made by Samsung. That&apos;s because some of Samsung&apos;s biggest features rely on flickering the display to trick your eyes into seeing something that&apos;s not actually there, and it wreaks havoc in some people&apos;s brains — including myself.</p><p>That&apos;s part of why I was so excited to get to use the Honor Magic 6 Pro, as its PWM rate is 10x the refresh rate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">of the Galaxy S24 series</a>, ensuring that I&apos;m able to use it for long periods of time.</p><p>While that&apos;s great — and it means I can finally use a phone with a comfortable display <strong>and</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-camera-review">a good camera</a> — Honor&apos;s method of achieving this high rate is far from conventional. In short, that means it doesn&apos;t work for everyone.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_QUgEftJtMQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Without getting into the weeds, my light meter can&apos;t properly read the backlight refresh frequency of the Honor Magic 6 Pro&apos;s display, even though I can see what&apos;s happening with a camera. It&apos;s a side effect of Honor doing something "weird" with its display, so I asked the company to go into a bit more detail on it.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Honor's display panel works differently from any other I've tested, and while that works well for me, it doesn't for some folks.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, all I was met with was a disappointing "sorry, we can&apos;t provide further details on this technology."</p><p>This makes it difficult to understand why this phone works incredibly well for my eyes but instantly causes pain for other flicker-sensitive users. It&apos;s a problem I&apos;ve had with other companies, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-display-pwm-frequency">like Google</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">Samsung</a>, who both have refused to comment or provide additional details on how their displays work beyond what each company&apos;s marketing department provides.</p><p>Meanwhile, Motorola continues to be one of the only companies that will discuss the topic at length with me. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-display-flickering">They even boasted</a> how their flicker-reduction technology ensures that the display is on 99.51% of each duty cycle, a more technical term I&apos;ve never heard from any other company.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iteBDJ5eAY4RZ4N9yBiN5U" name="Motorola-Edge-Plus-2023-display-playing-games-genshin-impact.jpg" alt="Playing Genshin Impact on the Motorola Edge+ (2023)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iteBDJ5eAY4RZ4N9yBiN5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Motorola is one of the only companies talking about how it actively performs market research to find out how much of its customer base is negatively affected by display flicker.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Motorola has even disclosed to me that it performs market research studies specific to display flicker in an attempt to figure out how many Motorola customers are negatively affected by flicker.</p><p>This is the kind of market-leading behavior I expect from a company like Samsung that could potentially negatively affect the health of hundreds of millions of people around the world. It&apos;s just as important as ensuring that phones don&apos;t emit harmful radiation, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/specific-absorption-rate-sar-cellular-telephones">all manufacturers have to do</a> before getting approval by governing bodies like the FCC.</p><p>Thankfully, I was able to sit down with Bill Maffucci from Kopin Corporation, a company that specializes in creating displays and lenses for XR devices, to discuss some of the finer points of how displays work. It was a refreshing conversation and it helped me understand the tenuous relationship between technologies like PWM and LTPO.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Technologies like PWM and LTPO complicate the already complicated nature of OLED panels, and companies aren't particularly willing to divulge how these work together.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Maffucci explained that an OLED display can light up and turn off in microseconds — one microsecond is one millionth (0.000001) of a second — meaning that companies now have options for dimming that they never had with LCDs. Couple that with the fact that reducing voltage on an OLED panel too much can cause bad color reproduction and noise, and you&apos;ll quickly understand why companies have started using PWM — which flickers the display on and off rapidly — more often to control brightness.</p><p>However, this becomes even more complicated when you throw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-does-ltpo-mean-and-why-is-it-important-on-your-device">LTPO</a> into the mix, a technology that adjusts the refresh rate of the display based on what&apos;s happening on screen. But while this sounds like it would interfere with the "backlight" cycle on an OLED, Maffucci confirmed to me that most LTPO OLEDs don&apos;t actually adjust the refresh rate of the display itself.</p><p>Rather, what&apos;s being adjusted is the graphics driver&apos;s rendering rate, and it&apos;s usually performed at a number that divides evenly into the display&apos;s <em>actual</em> refresh rate. For Honor, that means the 360Hz rate further complicates the situation in ways the company isn&apos;t willing to divulge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.97%;"><img id="vaLAyta5rHuonWbvKkQSdg" name="honor-keep-your-secrets-frodo.jpg" alt="A meme of Frodo Baggins" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vaLAyta5rHuonWbvKkQSdg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="1757" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central / New Line Cinema)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve noticed that more people than ever are flocking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://reddit.com/r/PWM_Sensitive/">PWM-sensitive online communities</a>, and I think it&apos;s both a combination of more flickering displays than ever plus people&apos;s raised awareness that this is a real issue — not just something in their imagination.</p><p>Even Google is playing around with new brightness controls at the system level, purportedly baking in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-even-dimmer-setting-spotted">new "even dimmer" option</a> into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. While that <em>could</em> help some people, the existing "extra dim" option in Android seems to wreak havoc on sensitive eyes.</p><p>However, the trend for more eye-friendly mobile displays has substantially improved over the past year. Companies like Motorola are leading the way, but display manufacturers like BOE, Visionox, and China Star all seem to recognize that something needs to change to prevent more widespread problems from happening.</p><p>Now, if we could only get companies to be a little less secretive about things that are problematic to their users&apos; health, that would be great. Regardless, I&apos;m happy to see companies like Honor trying to make better displays, even if the company doesn&apos;t want to reveal its secrets just yet.</p>

<hr>
<p>President Biden has signed a bill into law that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/23/tech/congress-tiktok-ban-what-next/index.html">CNN reports</a>. This comes just days after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-ban-just-got-the-houses-nod-and-it-might-be-law-real-soon">House approved the bill</a> and a day after the Senate voted in favor of it.</p><p>Nestled within a foreign aid package, the bill would make it so that app stores such as Google&apos;s Play Store and Apple&apos;s App Store can not legally offer TikTok within the United States. However, the ban does not happen overnight, as the bill gives TikTok owner ByteDance less than a year (270 days) to divest the app and find a potential buyer.</p><p>In response to the bill being signed into law, TikTok CEO Shou Chew took to the app to express his thoughts on the matter, saying, "We aren&apos;t going anywhere."</p>

<p>Chew points out that of the more than 170 million users on the platform, more than 7 million business owners rely on TikTok for their livelihoods and urges users to post videos about how the app impacts their lives. He also notes that TikTok will continue to invest in keeping its community "vibrant, exciting, and safe."</p><p>"Through our U.S. security efforts, we have built safeguards that no other peer company has made. We have invested billions of dollars to secure your data and keep our platform free from outside manipulation."</p><p>TikTok has been under fire over the past several years for its close ties to the Chinese government via parent company ByteDance, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-us-lawkmakers-want-tiktok-banned">lawmakers expressing concerns about U.S. data</a>. The U.S. has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-senate-bans-tiktok-app-from-government-devices">banned the app on government-issued devices</a>. Meanwhile, efforts to alleviate these concerns have largely failed, leaving the future of TikTok unclear for the app and its users. The question also remains whether or not ByteDance will be allowed to divest TikTok.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to TikTok for a comment on the bill being signed into law but did not receive a response in time for publication. However, a TikTok spokesperson told CNN that the company found the ban "unconstitutional" and that TikTok would continue to challenge the decision.</p>
