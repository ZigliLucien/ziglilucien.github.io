Samsung controls a sizeable chunk of this category thanks to its strong presence in the U.S., and seeing as how its immediate rivals don't sell in the region, it is unchallenged.</p><p>That isn't the case globally, and Huawei and Vivo are making positive moves with their own foldables. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a> is one of my favorite devices of 2025, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a> is arguably the most innovative phone around. Having used the tri-folding device over the course of 2025, I'm excited to see Samsung make its debut in this category.</p><p>Samsung confirmed it is rolling out the device, and while we don't have the name yet, it may be dubbed the Galaxy Z TriFold. I talked about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/heres-i-want-to-see-in-samsungs-tri-fold-phone">what I want to see in the Galaxy Z TriFold</a>, and here I'm rounding up all the latest leaks and details around the upcoming foldable.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Design</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.43%;"><img id="fcAn29fRoZ7ED5ymK2HCJT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-1" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fcAn29fRoZ7ED5ymK2HCJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="381" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Leaks around the design of the Galaxy Z TriFold point to a device that's similar to the Z Fold 7, but with an added panel, bringing the overall size of the device when unfolded to 10 inches. That basically means you get a tablet-sized device that folds down to a phone, and that unlocks a set of new use cases.</p><p>I routinely use my Mate XT fully unfurled, and it's just great to be able to access that kind of real estate in a foldable device. Samsung is said to be using a G-styled hinge that has a dual in-folding mechanism.</p><p>The panel itself should be similar to what's there on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and we'll have to wait and see if Samsung adds DC dimming. The design shouldn't be all that different either — there are only so many ways to make a foldable, after all — and we could see a similar camera island at the rear.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hardware"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Hardware</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ih5tgeaqYRUb8DQU93njtD" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-official-look" alt="Press renders of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ih5tgeaqYRUb8DQU93njtD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UniverseIce on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It isn't astonishing to think the Galaxy Z TriFold leverage the latest hardware. While Samsung hasn't stated as much, it's a given that the storage and memory configurations could be similar to the Z Fold 7.</p><p>When it comes to the battery, patent leaks point to three distinct batteries within the device, and while initial leaks suggested a 4,400mAh battery — the same size as the Z Fold 7 — we could be getting a bigger battery. This will prove to be pivotal considering the sheer real estate available, and Samsung needs to get the battery right.</p><p>Similarly, the foldable needs to get great cameras; the Mate XT takes fabulous photos and videos, and Samsung needs a device to challenge Huawei. Thankfully, it looks like the brand will use the 200MP camera that showed up in the Z Fold 7 in the tri-fold, and that should make things exciting.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-release-date"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Release date</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.00%;"><img id="pqMoqKxXFd7xQM8VKZJAJT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-4" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pqMoqKxXFd7xQM8VKZJAJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="427" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung showcased the Galaxy Z TriFold, and a launch is imminent. With the brand releasing its other foldables in July, that leaves a window in the winter where it can roll out marquee devices like the TriFold.</p><p>Given the uniqueness of the device, Samsung is said to be considering a limited launch, and that makes sense. The Galaxy Z TriFold is slated to launch in Samsung's home country and the UAE, with the brand touted to make under 200,000 units in total. With a launch near, we are starting to hear more about the device in question, and I'll update this post frequently as and when I get additional details on the Galaxy Z TriFold.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung controls a sizeable chunk of this category thanks to its strong presence in the U.S., and seeing as how its immediate rivals don't sell in the region, it is unchallenged.</p><p>That isn't the case globally, and Huawei and Vivo are making positive moves with their own foldables. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a> is one of my favorite devices of 2025, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a> is arguably the most innovative phone around. Having used the tri-folding device over the course of 2025, I'm excited to see Samsung make its debut in this category.</p><p>Samsung confirmed it is rolling out the device, and while we don't have the name yet, it may be dubbed the Galaxy Z TriFold. I talked about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/heres-i-want-to-see-in-samsungs-tri-fold-phone">what I want to see in the Galaxy Z TriFold</a>, and here I'm rounding up all the latest leaks and details around the upcoming foldable.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-design"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Design</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.43%;"><img id="fcAn29fRoZ7ED5ymK2HCJT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-1" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fcAn29fRoZ7ED5ymK2HCJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="381" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Leaks around the design of the Galaxy Z TriFold point to a device that's similar to the Z Fold 7, but with an added panel, bringing the overall size of the device when unfolded to 10 inches. That basically means you get a tablet-sized device that folds down to a phone, and that unlocks a set of new use cases.</p><p>I routinely use my Mate XT fully unfurled, and it's just great to be able to access that kind of real estate in a foldable device. Samsung is said to be using a G-styled hinge that has a dual in-folding mechanism.</p><p>The panel itself should be similar to what's there on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and we'll have to wait and see if Samsung adds DC dimming. The design shouldn't be all that different either — there are only so many ways to make a foldable, after all — and we could see a similar camera island at the rear.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hardware"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Hardware</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ih5tgeaqYRUb8DQU93njtD" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-official-look" alt="Press renders of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ih5tgeaqYRUb8DQU93njtD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UniverseIce on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It isn't astonishing to think the Galaxy Z TriFold leverage the latest hardware. While Samsung hasn't stated as much, it's a given that the storage and memory configurations could be similar to the Z Fold 7.</p><p>When it comes to the battery, patent leaks point to three distinct batteries within the device, and while initial leaks suggested a 4,400mAh battery — the same size as the Z Fold 7 — we could be getting a bigger battery. This will prove to be pivotal considering the sheer real estate available, and Samsung needs to get the battery right.</p><p>Similarly, the foldable needs to get great cameras; the Mate XT takes fabulous photos and videos, and Samsung needs a device to challenge Huawei. Thankfully, it looks like the brand will use the 200MP camera that showed up in the Z Fold 7 in the tri-fold, and that should make things exciting.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-release-date"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold: Release date</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.00%;"><img id="pqMoqKxXFd7xQM8VKZJAJT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-4" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pqMoqKxXFd7xQM8VKZJAJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="427" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung showcased the Galaxy Z TriFold, and a launch is imminent. With the brand releasing its other foldables in July, that leaves a window in the winter where it can roll out marquee devices like the TriFold.</p><p>Given the uniqueness of the device, Samsung is said to be considering a limited launch, and that makes sense. The Galaxy Z TriFold is slated to launch in Samsung's home country and the UAE, with the brand touted to make under 200,000 units in total. With a launch near, we are starting to hear more about the device in question, and I'll update this post frequently as and when I get additional details on the Galaxy Z TriFold.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The model picker currently has "Fast" and "Advanced" selections, with the latter being the default option. Following the Google Translate app tweak, users will be able to tap below the Google Translate logo to switch between models.</p><p>Google calls these additions "text-translation models," with the Advanced version offering "high accuracy for complex translations." Users can switch to the Fast alternative, which is "best for quick translation." The model picker isn't showing up for everyone yet. 9to5Google discovered it on the iOS version of the Google Translate app, but it hasn't appeared for Android Central on either the iOS or Android apps yet.</p><p>The choice of text-translation models will only apply to typed translation requests, as the name suggests. At the bottom of the model switcher, there's a disclaimer explaining the following: "Advanced is supported for text translation only in select languages." It's unclear which languages are currently supported, if the model picker is restricted to paid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Pro or Google AI Ultra subscribers</a>.</p><p>As the model switcher is for text-only requests, it won't affect live translation, a feature that is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/airpods-pro-3-vs-google-pixel-buds-pro-2-best-for-live-translate">gaining popularity across translation tools</a> and brands. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-2a-review">Pixel Buds 2a</a> users can take advantage of live translation, but they can't manually pick the translation model powering the feature.</p><h2 id="first-look-at-the-google-translate-model-picker-2">First look at the Google Translate model picker</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yypHeNaZWoQ5Y8uAV8GyD5" name="Google-Translate-Model-Picker-9to5Google" alt="Screenshots of the new model picker in Google Translate." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yypHeNaZWoQ5Y8uAV8GyD5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see in the screenshots from 9to5Google above, a pill appears under the Google Translate model noting the text translation model currently active.

The ad is titled "Planning a Quick Getaway?" and will be the first of a series, with a Christmas version to come.</p><p>"When your plans can’t wait, and you need the answer right away, AI Mode in Google Search can help you find flight and hotel information from the web, no matter how specific," the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWlfmUrazFw" target="_blank">YouTube video's description</a> explains. "Ask for a destination, dates, or just describe the kind of trip you want. No matter how complicated your travel question, you can get it all together, fast. Just Ask Google."</p><h2 id="google-s-wants-you-to-use-ai-mode-for-your-holiday-travel-2">Google's wants you to use AI Mode for your holiday travel</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gWlfmUrazFw" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The AI-generated plush turkey, called Tom, uses AI Mode with the prompt, "I need to go somewhere with direct flights and NO Thanksgiving…leaving tomorrow." Google Search returns city names, and the ad follows Tom's journey away from Thanksgiving celebrations. Notably, there are no people in the ad, and video generation models often trip up when trying to recreate humans.</p><p>Google isn't shying away from the fact that this AI Mode ad was created with AI, but it isn't advertising it either. The YouTube video has a standard disclosure for "altered or synthetic content," but Google doesn't point out that Veo 3 was used specifically.</p><p>This was intentional, according to the Wall Street Journal report. Robert Wong, the vice president of Google Creative Lab, told the publications consumers don't care whether an ad was made with AI or not.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/photos-to-video-in-google-photos-gets-veo-3-upgrade">Veo 3</a>, the video-generation model used to make the AI Mode ad, is widely available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-introduces-new-ai-tools-to-help-creatives-direct-like-a-pro">following a Google I/O 2025 announcement</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The app marketplace is surfacing AI-powered summaries for app reviews.</p><p>Now, instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-play-store-sucks-so-heres-what-i-use-instead">scrolling through lots of five-star praise or unclear one-star complaints</a>, users will see a short paragraph under a new section called “Users are saying,” as discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/play-store-ai-generated-review-summaries-3611995/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. This feature highlights the main pros and cons from app reviews, combining feedback from different ratings into a single summary.</p><p>The summaries appear beneath the "Ratings and reviews" section on select app pages and are powered by Google’s in-house AI models. They’re designed to capture both praise and criticism — for instance, pointing out that users love an app’s interface but have reported frequent crashes or slow performance.</p><p>Below the summary, you may see small buttons that let you filter reviews by topics like performance, design, or stability.</p><h2 id="gradual-rollout-underway-2">Gradual rollout underway</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:655px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:219.85%;"><img id="MkPeS82XPaWyRnyGL3CFMQ" name="Google-Play-Store-AI-generated-review-summaries" alt="AI-generated review summaries in the Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MkPeS82XPaWyRnyGL3CFMQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="655" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:655px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:219.85%;"><img id="hvwXZcA5DWcscXYVoNy2NQ" name="Google-Play-Store-AI-generated-review-summaries" alt="AI-generated review summaries in the Play Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvwXZcA5DWcscXYVoNy2NQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="655" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Android Authority reports that this feature is currently available to some users with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play-download-manage-apps">Play Store</a> version 48.5.23-31, which suggests it is being rolled out gradually. For now, only a few apps have this feature, so not everyone will see it yet.</p><p>This rollout is another sign of Google’s bigger AI push across its platforms. After bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-on-android-gemini-summaries-questions-update">AI summaries to Google Docs</a>, Gmail, and Search, among others, the Play Store is the latest stop in Google’s mission to make information easier to digest.</p><p>The company hopes to help users make faster, more informed download decisions without wading through repetitive feedback. That’s especially useful for popular apps with tens of thousands of reviews, where manually browsing can feel like a chore. So, while Google’s AI won’t tell you what to download, it’ll make sure you get there faster and a little less frustrated.</p><p>Still, there are a few caveats. These AI summaries only appear for apps that have enough review data for the system to analyze, meaning smaller or newer apps might be left out for now. And because the summaries are machine-generated, they could occasionally miss context or misrepresent niche opinions as common trends.</p> ]]></dc:content>

On that occasion, the model number SM-A576B/DS popped up, which is supposedly the international and dual-sim version of the midrange Galaxy phone.</p><p>The first internal test builds for the Samsung Galaxy A57 are firmware versions <strong>A576BXXU0AYJ7</strong>, <strong>A576BOXM0AYJ7</strong>, and <strong>A576BXXU0AYJ7</strong>. They don't tell us much about the upcoming device, aside from the fact that development is currently underway, as is expected. The models specifically correlate to the international version of the Galaxy A57, meaning we don't know whether the smartphone will arrive in the U.S. or not.</p><p>Samsung doesn't always release every A-series Galaxy in the U.S., but it brought the Galaxy A57 to the country this year. The company launched in March 2025 globally and it took a few extra months for the phone to make its way stateside.

A public test build of firmware v83 just rolled out to users this week and may finally have a solution to a problem that was keeping Quest gamers from enjoying their headsets.</p><p>In a nutshell, Quest games would randomly crash, giving users a "low memory" error that didn't seem to make sense. Reports have been piling up on Reddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ContractorsExfilZone/comments/1lc1qz3/meta_quest_3_low_memory_error/">since roughly May</a>, with users noting that the v76 firmware update seems to have caused it. Meta has released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v72-bad-christmas-update">several bad updates</a> to Quest headsets this year, but the latest v83 update may be a light at the end of the long tunnel.</p><p>Some users have surmised that this problem began with the "seamless multitasking" feature Meta introduced in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/172903867975450/?srsltid=AfmBOorpmXhXIHfvjDFxzfPioYnyRHJTetWls23Uobj6tEqlp1AaaJTL">v74 update in February</a>, which allowed Quest owners to run floating windows while they were playing VR games. This made it possible to look up YouTube videos or run chat apps while playing games, making the Quest feel more like a PC VR experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ozpQdTvob4SEHGQNw4E8A8" name="meta-quest-3-ui-with-asgards-wrath-2-youtube-video" alt="Running three windows while playing Asgard's Wrath 2 on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozpQdTvob4SEHGQNw4E8A8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When my Meta Quest 3 got the v83 public test firmware this week, I noticed that the seamless multitasking feature was no longer in the <em>experimental</em> settings section. Sure enough, it looks like Meta has marked this one as no longer a beta feature and has launched it as part of the big UI overhaul, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/133727602066940/?srsltid=AfmBOoqD2PkUlcGIj129pZ3kLFIVFYjDBVmq5-Dz1ko-TbHXNUc6cEIk">called Navigator</a>.</p><p>To test this out, I charged up my Meta Quest 3 and my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Adjustable-Headband-Accessories-Playtime-PC/dp/B0D4TGY2F2/">Kiwi Design K4 headstrap</a>, launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/asgards-wrath-2-review">Asgard's Wrath 2</a> (the largest game on the Quest), and then loaded up a bunch of YouTube videos, a browser window with X (Twitter) loaded, as well as the Meta Horizon discovery feed. You can see a screenshot of my setup above.</p><p>I then let the headset run with all this happening until it completely died, checking every 20 minutes and moving around in the game to ensure things were still working. After all those hours, I never saw Asgard's Wrath 2 crash. Instead, when memory clearly got low during a loading sequence in the game, the 2D apps reloaded themselves.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1899px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="JU3n6XuedVhaLgrXaPAHDL" name="meta-quest-v83-navigator" alt="An official screenshot of the new Navigator menu in Meta Quest v83 firmware" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JU3n6XuedVhaLgrXaPAHDL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1899" height="1068" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We'll need wider testing and user reports to ensure the bug has been properly squashed, but I'm feeling pretty confident after this test that this massive problem has finally been resolved.</p><p>I would <em>not</em> recommend users switch to PTC v83 unless they're already on the channel, as you have to perform a full factory reset in order to go back to stable firmware. Meta typically rolls out these public test firmware versions 2-3 weeks after they enter public testing, so I would expect all users to receive this update sometime later in November.</p><p>In the meantime, apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anagan79.itch.io/quest-games-optimizer">Quest Games Optimizer</a> may also help. If you're testing v83, let us know if you find the system to be more stable and if the low memory crashing problems are gone! We'll continue testing until then.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This could be changing. Google is apparently developing a new feature for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-17">Android 17</a>, internally dubbed "Min Mode," set to completely transform your phone's idle screen into an interactive, full-screen hub.</p><p>According to findings by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-17-aod-min-mode-rumor-3611806/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Min Mode is designed to let full-screen apps display simplified, ultra-efficient interfaces right on the AOD. Instead of just showing a static clock, your phone could soon keep live navigation, workout stats, or media controls visible even when the screen is technically off.</p><p>Min Mode is more like an alternate mode rather than a replacement for the traditional AOD. When your phone goes idle, Android 17 will check which app you were using. If that app supports Min Mode, it can take over the AOD using a special process registered through new system components called MinModeActivity and MinModeProvider. This allows apps to display minimal, low-refresh-rate UIs while staying within the same low-power environment that makes AOD efficient.</p><p>Digging through the Android 17 code, the outlet found that the system shifts each pixel by one pixel every 60 seconds to prevent burn-in.</p><h2 id="google-maps-leads-the-charge-2">Google Maps leads the charge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:987px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.31%;"><img id="ZA5CHRF8M4tLwLqhmSD4Ta" name="Google-Maps-power-saving-mode" alt="monochrome view of Google Maps' new power saving mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZA5CHRF8M4tLwLqhmSD4Ta.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="987" height="694" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From what’s been uncovered so far, Google Maps looks to be one of the first apps ready to take advantage of this new feature. Code references like com.google.android.apps.gmm.features.minmode.MinModeActivity suggest that Maps will be able to display simplified turn-by-turn directions directly on the AOD, so your route stays visible even when the phone’s main display turns off.</p><p>Early UI hints <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-is-testing-a-battery-saving-mode-youve-always-needed">show a stripped-down, monochrome design</a> with limited interactivity and no landscape support. It’s a subtle but practical step toward making the lock screen more useful without draining your battery.</p><p>This essentially turns the AOD into a lightweight extension of whatever task you were doing before locking your phone. Of course, Google will need to manage how much freedom developers get — too much clutter or constant activity could ruin the balance between visibility and battery efficiency that AOD is known for.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But where its rivals famously compromised, the Edge 70 is showing up with a feature that thin phones almost never have: a massive battery.</p><p>The main selling point of the Motorola Edge 70 is its body, which is ridiculously thin at just 5.99mm, and it weighs only 159 grams. The frame is aircraft-grade aluminum, the front is Gorilla Glass 7i, and the back has a unique nylon-textured finish.</p><p>It also packs both an IP69 rating for water and dust resistance and MIL-STD 810H durability. It’s available in three Pantone-certified colors: Lilly Pad, Gadget Grey, and Bronze Green.</p><h2 id="premium-build-no-compromises-2">Premium build, no compromises</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UpRdyygFuqmzazUQEEYTPQ" name="Motorola-Edge-70-full-lineup" alt="full color lineup of the Motorola Edge 70" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UpRdyygFuqmzazUQEEYTPQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola Poland)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Inside the super-slim chassis, Motorola stuffed a 4,800mAh silicon-carbon battery. That’s a huge capacity for any phone, let alone one this thin. It also supports 68W wired charging and 15W wireless.</p><p>However, this isn't a flagship-spec monster. It’s a strategic mid-range play, running on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-launches-snapdragon-7-gen-4">new Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chipset</a>, paired with 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 512GB of storage. The display is a 6.67-inch pOLED panel with a 2712 x 1220 resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and 4,500 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>Camera-wise, you get a 50MP main camera with optical stabilization, a 50MP ultrawide with macro capabilities, and a 50MP selfie camera. It ships with Android 16 alongside a promise of four major OS updates and six years of security patches.</p><p>The global version of what was the China-only X70 Air, the Edge 70 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/pl/pl/p/phones/motorola-edge/motorola-edge-70/pmipmjc43m9" target="_blank">priced at €799/£699</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_lists_edge_70_along_with_its_full_specs_on_its_official_website-news-70074.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>Motorola is taking a big risk with this launch.

Motorola is betting it has found the sweet spot: a phone that’s thin enough to feel futuristic but thick enough to house a battery that actually works.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company has had its hands full with seeding One UI 8 to older Galaxy phones, a process that was paused and resumed in October. Now, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 are finally receiving the October 2025 security patch as of Oct. 31, 2025.</p><p>The update is rolling out to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> owners in Europe, with more regions set to follow. The build number is <strong>F741BXXS2CYJ1</strong> for the Flip 6 and <strong>F956BXXS2CYJ1</strong> for the Fold 6, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-get-october-2025-security-update/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>. The update size for both devices should be fairly small since each phone received the bigger boost to One UI 8 previously.</p><p>The patch comes with 14 fixes for security vulnerabilities included in the Android Security Bulletin, all of which are of a "high" severity level. Samsung adds 20 patches of its own that are specific to Galaxy devices, and they all have either "high" or "moderate" severity levels. As the fixes aren't available for everyone yet, we don't have details for every security vulnerability addressed in the October 2025 update.</p><p>Samsung rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-owners-are-finally-seeing-a-crucial-october-2025-patch">the patch for its newer foldables</a>, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7, earlier in October. The security update has also already made its way to the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy S23 series, and Galaxy S22 series. Although the month already came and went, the October 2025 security update is now becoming widely available for a variety of Samsung Galaxy models.</p><h2 id="how-to-check-if-the-october-2025-patch-is-available-2">How to check if the October 2025 patch is available</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TV3t5LMRSBccRMwNn8WG6h" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-update-01" alt="Updating to One UI 8 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TV3t5LMRSBccRMwNn8WG6h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can check for an update on your Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Galaxy Z Fold 6 by opening the <strong>Settings app</strong> and tapping the <strong>Software update</strong> tab.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> was a turning point for the Chinese manufacturer. Although OnePlus made phones for a decade, there was always a sense that its camera prowess wasn't up to scratch — at least against its Chinese rivals and Google.</p><p>That narrative changed with the OnePlus 13, with the device able to deliver standout cameras with the same versatility as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200</a> and other phones in this category. I'm still a little miffed that we didn't get a Pro version (much less an Ultra model), but it's a good thing that OnePlus focused on a single device, and it isn't like the OnePlus 13 misses out on much.</p><p>I started using the phone in December 2024, and tested it extensively at launch. While I didn't review the device this time, I used it quite a bit throughout the course of 2025, switching to it intermittently. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> now available in China and a global launch on November 13, it's time to take a look at how the OnePlus 13 holds up nearly a year after its debut; to see where it still has an edge, and where it doesn't quite manage to measure up any longer.</p><h2 id="one-of-the-best-designs-of-2025-2">One of the best designs of 2025</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FarUerJUmM77QqYYh4CZkF" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13 testing one year later" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FarUerJUmM77QqYYh4CZkF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5480" height="3087" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'll admit that I wasn't a fan of the design when I saw the renders of the OnePlus 13. I've always liked the designs of OnePlus phones in the past, and I felt that the manufacturer was veering away from its design ethos in an effort to stand out.</p><p>Thankfully, it turned out to be a non-issue; the OnePlus 13 still feels good in-hand, and even though it has a flat design, the subtle bevels ensure the sides don't dig into your palm. The weight balance is ideal, and the unique leather back continues to be one of my favorite features on the phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7ern7Xrw6ueNeboASKfdXF" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13 testing one year later" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ern7Xrw6ueNeboASKfdXF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The leather is softer and has a better texture than regular leather-backed phones, and after nearly a year of use, it continues to look great — the blue model is still my recommendation. I didn't see any issues with the build quality even with a dozen or so tumbles, and the fact that the rear panel has leather instead of glass also makes a difference in this area.</p><p>What's notable is that the custom glass layer at the front did an admirable job. I don't use a case with my phones, so it's good to see the device come away unscathed after long-term use. Similarly, I had no problems using it outdoors during India's monsoon season, with IP68 and IP69 water resistance clearly up to the task.</p><h2 id="hardware-with-plenty-of-power-left-2">Hardware with plenty of power left</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fCpyaspGuBLc2XyCAMjmGF" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13 testing one year later" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCpyaspGuBLc2XyCAMjmGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 6.82-inch AMOLED panel continues to be one of the best around; it has excellent colors, good brightness levels, and doesn't have any issues with HDR content. There really isn't much to talk about here other than to say that the green line issue that plagued devices in the past just wasn't a problem.</p><p>Honestly, I can say the same about the hardware. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is an absolute powerhouse, and I still feel that it isn't being used to its full potential — you just don't have that caliber of games on Android. We've seen manufacturers go to great lengths in recent years to tout lag-free use after several years, and to me, that makes the biggest difference with these kinds of phones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EVpZ6onLVvctoNpb7QhLFF" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13 testing one year later" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EVpZ6onLVvctoNpb7QhLFF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sure, any phone is undoubtedly fast when you start using it (unless you have Samsung's A series devices), but the real test is after a year or two, when things inevitably start slowing down. Thankfully, this isn't an issue on the OnePlus 13, and the phone feels just as fluid as the day I set it up. OnePlus says the phone will be fast even after four years of use, and I don't doubt those claims — I recently booted up the OnePlus 8T to test it out for a while, and it held up astonishingly well.</p><p>Battery life has been consistent too; I still get a day's worth out of the device, and there isn't any noticeable battery degradation. Of course, the use of silicon carbon battery tech means the OnePlus 13 should have better longevity than earlier models, and I'll be putting that to the test by reevaluating the phone next year. As it stands, the battery is just as reliable, and I like that I can easily charge the device with any USB PD charger at 50W.</p><h2 id="oxygenos-16-gives-a-much-needed-software-boost-2">OxygenOS 16 gives a much-needed software boost</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="GXDXRsTEmwMphvayRnQGXF" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13 testing one year later" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GXDXRsTEmwMphvayRnQGXF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 13 launched with OxygenOS 15, and it just got the update to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>-based OxygenOS 16. The update introduces a brand-new UI with translucent effects, and it has better cohesion and increased fluidity. While I'm still not enthused about the UI looking so similar to iOS 26, I'll admit that it is better than OxygenOS 15.</p><p>The software update injects freshness and additional fluidity, and makes the device that much better. You get a decent number of new features as well, and while there's now a split notification pane, you can use the older unified style.</p><h2 id="oneplus-13-a-year-later-still-going-strong-2">OnePlus 13, a year later: Still going strong</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uNBa5zRTwxZn7xg6HacNTF" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13 testing one year later" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uNBa5zRTwxZn7xg6HacNTF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just because the OnePlus 15 is launching doesn't make the OnePlus 13 any less of a phone.

The sunglasses have a sporty design and workout-inspired features, including better water-resistance and longer battery life. One of Vanguard's best features is software integration with Garmin, Strava, and Health Connect, and it's now rolling out other Meta smart glasses.</p><p>The company quietly added "Autocapture with Garmin" to the list of camera features supported by Meta HSTN and both generations of Ray-Ban Meta on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/compare/" target="_blank">website</a>.

The features aren't listed in the release notes for version 19.2 of Meta glasses software. Android Central spotted Garmin and Strava integrations using version 244.0.0.30.167 of the Meta AI app for Android, and version 19.2 on Oakley Meta HSTN.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jU7jgSWtskdA35jouuCZzP" name="Meta-HSTN-Autocapture-Screenshots" alt="Garmin integration in the Meta AI app for Oakley Meta HSTN." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jU7jgSWtskdA35jouuCZzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, we had to create a new Meta AI account to see the Garmin and Strava app connection options.

The Meta AI app will walk you through the process of adding a Meta data field to your favorite workouts on a Garmin watch.</p><p>From there, Oakley Meta and Ray-Ban Meta users can start using Autocapture to record key moments during their workouts. The integration also lets your Meta glasses answer questions about your time, distance, pace, and other metrics in real time — based on Garmin data. Keep in mind you'll need to have your phone, Garmin device, and Meta glasses all with you to use these features.</p><h2 id="not-an-oakley-meta-vanguard-exclusive-2">Not an Oakley Meta Vanguard exclusive</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="meZASeH7vZMVRJQTSHwMQE" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-and-Garmin-Venu-X1" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses and Garmin Venu X1 smartwatch sitting on a wooden board together." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/meZASeH7vZMVRJQTSHwMQE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta touted Garmin and Strava integrations as critical Oakley Meta Vanguard features, but luckily they're also arriving on (almost) all of the brand's smart glasses.

This new template set is said to be "smarter" and more "helpful" to the user. Google's calling these new templates "trendy" with automation and "smart media selection," capable of deciding the best shots from your camera roll that you should use.</p><p>Users can also get a little more creative with music and text.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6128862?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&#zippy=%2Cstart-with-a-template">support document</a> for the feature, Google explains how to create a "Highlight Video," which can leverage these templates. Users must first navigate to <strong>Google Photos > Create > Highlight Video </strong>to get going. Once there, Google says you'll find a selection of templates, which are all "pre-made videos" that already feature music, text, and beat-matching. Once the template you want is selected, users can manually pick their photos, or let Google's automation do the work for them through "Help me select."</p><p>The manual side involves using Photos' Search, and typing in names, dates, and places.</p><p>The reviewing/editing process is where some more user creativity can come into play. Users can tap the music note icon to swap the tunes, reorder their clips, or remove them. The publication states that the new templates haven't appeared widely just yet, but that shouldn't take long to change.</p><h2 id="a-template-for-highlights-2">A template for highlights</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GuQu3rSySDYsEc52wikEKm" name="google-photos-create-launch-hero" alt="Google Photos is rolling a new "Create" button, letting users turn their memories into unique remixes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GuQu3rSySDYsEc52wikEKm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8733" height="4912" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Photos <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-10-year-celebration-updates">celebrated its 10th birthday</a> earlier this summer, and it looks like the company behind it isn't slowing down the new features. In September, the Photos app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/photos-to-video-in-google-photos-gets-veo-3-upgrade">incorporated Veo 3's</a> image-to-video generation technology.

The Create tab is where this all takes place, giving access to more tools, alongside the Veo 3 model.</p><p>Also, the idea of hopping on trends and templates is quite familiar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-longer-content-template-details">following YouTube's update</a>. Shorts gained a new feature, which gave short-form content creators a "template" button when watching other videos. In Remix, users will find a "use this template" icon that brings that trending music or sound clip into their dashboard, so they can put their own spin on things.</p><p>YouTube said it was preparing an expansion to its template feature, enabling users to grab multiple clips for videos.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung appears to be lining up its next flagship launch for February 25, 2026.</p><p>That’s a switch from its usual late-January or early-February window. According to Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mt.co.kr/tech/2025/11/02/2025103113281189654" target="_blank">Money Today</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1984803640192999894" target="_blank">@Jukanlosreve</a>), Samsung is prepping the Galaxy Unpacked event in San Francisco, and the choice of location is just as telling as the date.</p><p>Samsung is reportedly heading back to San Francisco for the first time since the Galaxy S23 launch due to its status as a hub for artificial intelligence, and Samsung apparently plans to make a massive statement. The company is positioning the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> series as the definitive AI smartphone and showcasing its entire new AI strategy from the heart of the tech world.</p><p>The shift in timing seems to be linked to tweaks in the lineup. Samsung was apparently mulling changes such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-edge-might-not-be-dead">introducing a Pro variant or an Edge version in place of the traditional Plus model</a>, but now leaks suggest the company is planning to retain the familiar trio: base, Plus, and Ultra.</p><p>That said, earlier rumors had pointed to a possible postponement to March 2026, so the February date, while plausible, isn’t officially confirmed. Additionally, this new date feels like a return to an older schedule, one we haven't seen since the Galaxy S9 way back in 2018.</p><h2 id="ai-is-the-headliner-2">AI is the headliner</h2><p>Beyond dates and names, the Galaxy S26 series is shaping up to lean heavily into AI, new silicon, and upgraded camera hardware. Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/sec/sec.php?c=sec&y=3154" target="_blank">executive remarks</a> flagged “user-centric next-gen AI,” a “second-generation custom AP,” and stronger performance with “new camera sensors.”</p><p>In particular, the custom AP clue suggests that Samsung’s in-house Exynos 2600 chip will power some models.</p><p>Design leaks also hint at some tangible changes. The Ultra model may have a more pronounced pill-shaped camera bump, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-qi2-magnetic-charging">support for the next-gen Qi2 wireless charging standard</a> (thanks to a built-in magnetic ring), and possibly the continuation of the triple-lens stack.</p><p>Of course, leaks are leaks — nothing official yet. But if it all holds up, the S26 series could mark Samsung’s clearest statement yet about where its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">flagship phones</a> are headed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A good headset is a must-have, and is usually one of the first things that goes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tech-summer-travel-with-toddlers">my travel bag</a>. I used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-review">Nothing's Headphone 1</a> in the past (mostly due to the looks and sound quality), but I upgraded to Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 in the last month, and it has been outstanding.</p><p>I used the earlier model, the QuietComfort Ultra, for quite a while now, and I like the design and customizable sound along with terrific noise isolation. The QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 doesn't change things too much; it looks the same and has the same great sound. Essentially, it's an iterative update that addresses two issues: audio over USB-C and battery life. The QC Ultra Gen 2 lasts up to 30 hours on a charge, six hours more than its predecessor.</p><p>The increase in battery life makes all the difference in regular use, and why I went with the QC Ultra Gen 2 over other headsets I have on hand. Notably, I found it to be better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">Sony WH-1000XM6</a> for my own use; it is a smidgen lighter at 250g, but it fits much better on my head, and I found it to be extremely comfortable on long-haul intercontinental flights. The headband has a good range of adjustability, and it distributes the weight of the headset evenly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="GnWgG4bHV2bXATQ5JfbtrF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GnWgG4bHV2bXATQ5JfbtrF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another plus point is that it doesn't take up as much room; it folds down flat (just like the Sony), but the carrying case isn't anywhere as large, and that makes the QC Ultra Gen 2 a little easier to slot into my admittedly-crowded tech bag. The clamping force isn't as high, and the comfortable fit and plush ear pads have a huge impact on a 20-hour flight. I had the headset on the entire time while traveling to the U.S. from India, and most of the time, I didn't even notice it was there.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="nUh8bLmyg8LKw6QYSR2DxF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nUh8bLmyg8LKw6QYSR2DxF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="q9Zxts6KJ529okyucUYRxF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q9Zxts6KJ529okyucUYRxF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fvye96t5TxijVbyh8tTwvF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fvye96t5TxijVbyh8tTwvF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BzydwpinVqJs6bZavFbVhF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BzydwpinVqJs6bZavFbVhF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="H6DSDjUv8CdpJZvsuBxcHF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H6DSDjUv8CdpJZvsuBxcHF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>That brings me to the next part: noise isolation. Both Bose and Sony do a brilliant job in this area, and I found the QC Ultra Gen 2 to tune out the incessant whine of jet engines without any problems — it handles the low rumble of engines a little better than Sony. Honestly, if you're a frequent traveler, investing in a headset with good noise isolation is the best thing you can do, and the QC Ultra Gen 2 is among the best — if not the best overall — in this regard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="oGqvJWJtjRMx5NsgmypVpF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oGqvJWJtjRMx5NsgmypVpF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The angled design of the audio drivers means you get detailed sound, and Bose does a standout job with spatial audio, offering an expanded soundstage that's impressive. Again, this makes a difference on a long flight, and while Bose doesn't have extensive EQ options, I always found the brand's tuning to be preferable to my tastes — more so than the WH-100XM6. The bass in particular is vibrant and detailed, and it makes listening to most genres that much more enjoyable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8DrzmgSUKNkaJnnXqcAuhF" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8DrzmgSUKNkaJnnXqcAuhF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are other niceties, including the ability to get lossless audio over USB-C.

Rumor has it that TSMC could likely be skipping the traditional 2nm process for TSMC's advanced N2P, promising an impressive performance boost and reduced power consumption—though this leap in technology could come at a steep price for consumers.</p><p>The chip in question is the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6, reportedly codenamed SM8975. Reliable leaker Digital Chat Station said on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/QbdJd0Dv1" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that Qualcomm is apparently skipping straight to TSMC's most advanced 2nm manufacturing process, N2P (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-6-leak-3610819/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>To put that in perspective, the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> chip — which powers top-tier phones like the Xiaomi 17 and OnePlus 15 — is built on a 3nm process.

Many people use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> made by companies like Samsung, and those include a built-in solution from the company that made your particular watch. Yes, it will make things like syncing alarms between a Google Pixel device and another device difficult, but you're not going to lose anything.</p><h2 id="why-it-s-happening-is-more-interesting-2">Why it's happening is more interesting</h2><p>Chances are, you only care about this if you use one Pixel device and one Galaxy device; this is more common than you might realize. Even then, you know you'll still be able to have alarms, timers, stopwatches, and all the other things a clock app should do on both devices, even if the apps come from two different places. Like I said, it's not that big of a deal.</p><p>Why it's happening might be, though.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Lg9jvE5kBqe73qpmf2RTSE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-custom-Tile" alt="A custom "Morning" Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing alarm and reminder info" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lg9jvE5kBqe73qpmf2RTSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A while ago, I wrote about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/androids-biggest-feature-is-also-its-biggest-flaw">Android's biggest strength</a> - being available and open to manufacturer customizations - was also its biggest weakness. Dropping support for the clock app is very likely a cost-saving initiative by Google; not having to test and support an app for devices it doesn't control saves both time and resources. It will save money while shifting more responsibility to the companies making the products - now Samsung has to make sure everything is perfect in the clock app for Galaxy devices, for example.</p><p>Google will never be able to get away with scaling back what little bit of "openness" Android offers. The only alternative is to act more like a hardware maker. It's also not the first time we've seen this sort of move from Google. The phone dialer is an excellent example, and if you really want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-phones-now-use-ai-to-detect-scam-calls-in-real-time">kill as many spam calls as you can</a>, you need to use Google's phone app. Google doesn't offer the "smart" spam detection to anyone as a standalone API. Of course, other AI tricks and tools are also at play here, with every phone seemingly having something different, depending on who makes it.</p><p>It's also something I think we need to get used to reading about, especially with Samsung's offerings. Plain and simple: if you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">modern Galaxy phone</a>, you do not need apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/call-me-crazy-i-prefer-ios-google-chrome-app-androids">Google Chrome</a>, a Google Address book, or even the Gmail app. You might want them and find them useful, but every function they offer is replicated in Samsung's own apps. Google could (it won't) drop "third-party" support for non-Pixel devices from these apps tomorrow, and other than bad press, nothing would really change.</p><p>The one issue is cross-device and cross-platform synchronization. Google will never remove the Gmail app (for example) from phones that aren't a Pixel because it wants people to use Gmail. Allowing us to have one account synchronized across every device with a screen is useful enough that we're going to keep using a dedicated and simple-to-set-up Gmail app, which happens to tie in well with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-google-sell-your-data">Google's business of getting eyeballs</a> on the web. Not every app is that way, though.</p><p>Samsung's address book leverages the feature of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/contacts/answer/2753077?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid" target="_blank">using Google's cloud to sync</a> everything without using Google's People app. Google doesn't really monetize its address book (I pray they never do), so it could drop app support for it without any serious issues. Most of Google's small, basic apps are this way, and if you have a Google account, you can sync things like addresses and phone numbers on any app from any phone maker.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4608px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bdEDEjJJGzFq9iSnqoSg5k" name="google-contacts-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Contacts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bdEDEjJJGzFq9iSnqoSg5k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4608" height="2592" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What concerns me are apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>. Right now, it's in Google's best interests to support Google Photos on every smartphone and modern web browser. The app is l<em>ightly</em> monetized and can act as a gateway to buying photo prints, but the real draw for Google is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-was-quietly-collecting-your-messages-and-phone-app-data">analytics it harvests</a>, knowing who is using what, where they are using it, how often they use it, etc. Everyone wants a tighter leash on this sort of thing in the name of privacy, but if that happens, is it really worth the time and money to keep the app for iOS or even Galaxy phones around?</p><p>We know the answer: it's not. Google isn't here to make your day brighter or your life easier; it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://killedbygoogle.com/" target="_blank">here to make money</a>. Take that ability away, and the company will shift focus onto the next money-maker.</p><p>This had to happen eventually, and it will keep happening. Google can not (<strong>and should not)</strong> act as some overlord and assume full control over all software on licensed Android devices, so apps like Samsung's Galaxy Clock are never going away.</p><p>We don't <strong>want</strong> them to go away, even if we never use them. What we should always want is choice, and seeing our choices slowly whittled down, especially with the advent of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/best-android-ai-apps">all things AI</a>, the next big idea might never happen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It seems that might not be the case for too much longer, as the company is now branching out into smartphones with the AYANEO Phone.</p><p>The company surprised everyone by dropping a teaser video that gives us just the slightest glimpse of what's to come. From the almost two-minute video, all we know is that the AYANEO Phone will feature the company's Retro REMAKE branding, which debuted in 2023 and brings retro-styled colorways to modern handhelds such as the AYANEO Pocket DMG and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ds-is-the-worlds-first-dual-screen-android-handheld">Pocket DS</a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dol0mdKunVE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>From there, a silhouette of the phone begins to appear, revealing the dual rear camera setup. Initially, I was getting some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony/sonys-xperia-10-vii-takes-a-page-from-the-pixels-design-playbook">Sony Xperia vibes</a>, until I noticed that this isn't going to be just any ordinary phone. After the phone comes completely into view, you can make out what appears to be bumpers on both the top and bottom of the left side (right-side if the screen was facing you.)</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DsXvxziXnVmDPCMLS5t7zW" name="ayaneo-phone-teaser-render" alt="AYANEO Phone teaser render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsXvxziXnVmDPCMLS5t7zW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's really not much else to go off of here, besides the inclusion of the triggers and the dual-camera setup. However, after tossing a screenshot from the YouTube video into Photoshop and cranking up the brightness, we can get a better look at the design. Needless to say, it's probably a good thing that AYANEO isn't trying to go for style points here.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bTkBrjsfMVNZVqAjXAB4rQ" name="ayaneo-phone-youtube-render-brightness" alt="AYANEO Phone with brightness adjusted to reveal design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bTkBrjsfMVNZVqAjXAB4rQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Technically, this isn't the first time that we've heard about AYANEO getting into the smartphone business. Earlier this year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ayaneo-might-bring-back-one-of-the-most-unique-phone-designs-and-im-here-for-it">AYANEO Phone was teased</a> during a livestream where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ds-is-the-worlds-first-dual-screen-android-handheld">AYANEO Pocket DS</a> and KONKR Pocket FIT were introduced. However, that was back in August, and we haven't seen or heard any rumblings about it since then.</p><p>Once released, it will provide an alternative to a segment of the market that is largely dominated by the likes of RedMagic and ASUS. Of those, only RedMagic is easily accessible here in the U.S., as the company's latest phones usually arrive on Amazon shortly after they are released. Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS' ROG Phone</a> lineup is only readily available in select markets, leaving those in the States to rely on importing or picking one up from the second-hand market.</p><p>It's too early to tell which category the AYANEO Phone will fall into, as the U.S. market is notoriously difficult to penetrate, especially for newcomers.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The post states, if you have a Pixel Watch, you won't be affected by this new decision. However, if you have "any other Wear OS" watch, you will see this change. To break this down, Google says that watches without the Clock app installed already will no longer find it available via the Play Store.</p><p>If you've already previously installed the Clock app, you can continue to use it, though you should know that it will no longer receive updates.</p><p>Google explains that the reason it's made this change is due to other "watch brands offering their own default clock apps on Wear OS." As a result, Google's Clock app, which you could previously download on, say, a Galaxy Watch, has been retracted. The clock is gone, as well as the included alarm, timer, and stopwatch functions within the app.</p><p>Some users on the Wear OS support thread have already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/384182062?hl=en&msgid=384318597">voiced their displeasure</a> with the move, but it seems that Google's decision is set in stone.

Data in Google Sheets can become a bit much, but Gemini's updates arriving for October aim to improve its format and ensure the app's analytical capabilities are up to par. Google states Sheets can now understand complex and multi-step instructions from users.</p><p>As an example, the post highlights Sheets' ability to "delete all archived rows, apply conditional formatting, and add a 'Notes' column" all in a single prompt. Moreover, Gemini advances with "web grounding." Users can now ask the AI to conduct some research on the internet.</p><p>The AI can input the information you deserve into your spreadsheet automatically, as well as opening its abilities to more languages, such as Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, French, Italian, and German.</p><p>Business security is always an object of discussion, so new AI defenses are rolling in for October. Google says it's bringing in ransomware protections for Drive users on desktop. This runs in real-time, and if the system is triggered, Google says users will have their file sync halted. There will also be a visible notification on your computer, informing you of what's happened, so you can take immediate action.</p><p>The post adds that users can restore any corrupted files "in bulk" to a version where the ransomware did not exist.</p><h2 id="ai-protections-hit-gmail-2">AI protections hit Gmail</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L" name="google-gemini-hero-banner-wide.jpg" alt="Google Gemini brings "custom Gems" to Gemini Advanced, Business, and Enterprise users." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aK7fsfNsYnnbrmsSazYp2L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gmail's also getting in on the AI defenses, as Google rolls out E2EE (end-to-end encrypted) protections. Now, users in Workspace can send "encrypted and confidential" emails to whomever they need to, even if they "use a different email provider or work outside your organization."</p><p>Wrapping up the huge October drop are thread summaries for users in Google Chat, as well as "refine me," which corrects any grammar mistakes and more before sending. Speech translation in Meet grab an expansion, bringing in English to German, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.</p><p>Google highlights its video generation update for Flow and the Gemini app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-steps-up-its-creativity-in-3-1-version-update-for-realism">which brought Veo 3.1</a> to users. Over the base v3 model, Veo 3.1 is said to give users more creative agency with their generated video clips. Additionally, this updated model enhances its sound capabilities, gives users better narrative control, and even touts better "realism" for generated textures.</p><p>The Veo 3.1 model is available in Google Vids, Flow, and the Gemini app.</p><p>October's drop sort of piggybacks off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-huge-august-workspace-update-caught-up-faster-vids-gen-ai">the one from August</a>. During the dog days of summer, Google brought file summaries to Chat, Video Overviews to NotebookLM, and upgraded the Vids app with Veo 3 (and that's now gone up to v3.1 in just two months).</p> ]]></dc:content>

This amount includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/google-hit-with-345-billion-eu-antitrust-fine-over-adtech-practices-2025-09-05/" target="_blank">$3.5 billion European Commission fine</a>, the company had to shell out.</p><p>Looking ahead, Q4 also seems promising for Alphabet, and Pichai noted that Gemini 3.0, its coming "later this year."</p><h2 id="samsung-and-meta-also-saw-a-great-q3-2025-2">Samsung and Meta also saw a great Q3 2025</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4583px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rzgiq2kADpqhT7D9e5nPAT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-6" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rzgiq2kADpqhT7D9e5nPAT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4583" height="2578" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-shine-as-samsung-posts-its-strongest-quarter-in-years"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-zuckerberg-predicts-when-ai-glasses-will-be-profitable"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Samsung also reported its third-quarter earnings this week, and the numbers indicate that they had their strongest quarter in years, thanks to the launch of their foldables. The company’s operating profit surged 32.5% year over year to KRW 12.2 trillion (about $8.5 billion). Samsung's semiconductor chips are also fueling this boom, but the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Z Flip 7 had a major role to play in Samsung’s financial success.</p><p>These devices, along with other flagship models, tablet and wearables sales, drove the mobile division's revenue up 11% from the previous quarter. Samsung saw a consolidated revenue of KRW 86.1 trillion ($60.5 billion) and a net profit of KRW 12.2 trillion in Q3.</p><p>As for Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, it did bring in a total revenue of $51.24 billion, which is a 26% increase year-over-year, surpassing analysts' forecasts. Advertising and Meta's family of apps have contributed to these record earnings this quarter. Metrics like ad impressions increased by 14% and the average price per ad jumped to 10%.</p><p>Meta seems to be spending tens of billions on AI infrastructure to "front-load" computing capabilities for an AI Superintelligence, to the point that investors are worried. Amid ambitious AI investments, the company faces significant hurdles, particularly as Reality Labs continues to operate at a loss of $4.4 billion.</p><h2 id="finally-samsung-s-galaxy-z-trifold-2">Finally..

At the APEC Summit in South Korea, the company officially unveiled the Galaxy Z TriFold.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither media nor attendees were allowed to use their phones at the event, but according to Korean outlet Dailian, the prototype was showcased behind a glass display. An animation played on the glass display, showing how the foldable would work.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold will feature two hinges and three folding display parts (hence the name 'TriFold'). However, unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a> that folds outward and inward, the Galaxy Z TriFold will use a U-shaped mechanism — meaning both outer folding screens will fold inward.

The price is the obvious reason, and even though the 2025 model brings <em>some</em> improvements, they're absolutely <strong>not</strong> worth $500. Compare the spec sheets and you'll see what I mean:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Motorola Razr Plus 2025</p></th><th  ><p>Motorola Razr Plus 2024</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (internal)</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch, pOLED, FHD+, 2640x1080, HDR10+, LTPO 165Hz, 3,000 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch, pOLED, FHD+, 2640 x 1080, HDR10+, 165Hz LTPO, 3000 nit peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (external)</p></td><td  ><p>4-inch, pOLED, 1272 x 1080, 165Hz, LTPO, 2,400 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>4-inch, pOLED, 1272 x 1080, 165Hz, LTPO 2400 nit peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 </p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB UFS 4.0</p></td><td  ><p>256GB UFS 4.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, (f/1.7, 0.8μm) or 12.6MP (1.6μm Quad Pixel), OIS, Instant-all Pixel, Focus</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, (f/1.7, 0.8μm) or 12.6MP (1.6μm Quad Pixel), OIS, Instant-all Pixel, Focus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP telephoto lens (f/2.0, 0.64um) or 12.6MP (1.28μm Quad Pixel), 2x optical zoom</p></td><td  ><p>50MP telephoto lens (f/2.0, 0.64um) or 12.6MP (1.28μm Quad Pixel), 2x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP (f/2.4, 0.7μm) or 8MP (f/2.4, 1.4um) Quad Pixel</p></td><td  ><p>32MP (f/2.4, 0.7μm) or 8MP (f/2.4, 1.4um) Quad Pixel</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>3 mics, dual stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos, Snapdragon Sound</p></td><td  ><p>3 mics, dual stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos, Snapdragon Sound</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh, 45W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 5W reverse charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh, 45W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 5W reverse charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (open)</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 171.42 x 7.09mm</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 171.42 x 7.09mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (closed)</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 88.09x 15.32mm</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 88.09x 15.32mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>189g</p></td><td  ><p>189g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The only real difference here is that the 2025 model has dust resistance and a titanium hinge. Again, not worth $500, even if it is nice to have. The cameras, storage, RAM, processor, and all other specs are identical between the models, and I simply wouldn't recommend getting the 2025 model while the 2024 one is still sold, especially at $500 less.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For a limited time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Flip-7-Portable-waterproof-and-drop-proof-speaker-Blue/13927023108" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart has cut $41 off the price of the JBL Flip 7 Bluetooth speaker</strong></a>, bringing it down to just $109.</p><p>The 7 is JBL's latest iteration of the Flip series, offering improvements to battery life and overall audio quality from previous generations. Arguably one of the largest benefits to the Flip is its size and shape, which is small and round enough to be portable, but large enough to boast a truly bass-forward sound that smaller speakers can't match. It stands at a little over 7 inches long and weighs about 3.21 pounds, while offering peak audio levels of 25W and up to 14 hours of battery life, according to JBL.</p><p>The unit charges using a USB-C port and features a water and dust resistance rating of IP68, making it perfectly suitable for most outdoor use cases. Beyond that, it also lets you access multi-band EQ settings using the JBL app, along with a durable design that's equally stylish. While this particular deal is available for the Blue and Red versions of the speaker, you can also get it in Black, Camo, Purple, or White for just a little bit more.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.95" data-dimension48="$149.95" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Flip-7-Portable-waterproof-and-drop-proof-speaker-Blue/13927023108" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:898px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.22%;"><img id="9XAFfwfYXXrmRDesukgCwB" name="jbl-flip-7-product-image" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9XAFfwfYXXrmRDesukgCwB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="898" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>JBL Flip 7:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Flip-7-Portable-waterproof-and-drop-proof-speaker-Blue/13927023108" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.95" data-dimension48="$149.95" data-dimension25=""><del>$149.95</del> <strong>$106.72 at Walmart</strong></a></p><p>Walmart is offering the JBL Flip 7 Bluetooth speaker for just $107 right now, marking $43 in savings from the normal purchase price. From its punchy, clear sound to the durable, yet portable build, the Flip series has been well-liked since its release, and this generation includes a handful of important improvements over the 6 and 5.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/JBL-Flip-7-Portable-waterproof-and-drop-proof-speaker-Blue/13927023108" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$149.95" data-dimension48="$149.95" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker that doesn't compromise audio quality; you want something that has water and dust resistance so it can be used for outdoor purposes like camping, hiking, and more; having a long battery life is highly important to you when it comes to buying a Bluetooth speaker.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for something even smaller or more portable like the company's Clip lineup; you'd prefer to go with a cheaper Bluetooth speaker, or you'd like to upgrade to one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">best Bluetooth speakers </a>on the market and you have the extra budget to spend; you need something that has super fast charging capabilities.</p><p>The JBL Flip 7 is a solid Bluetooth speaker with a great shape, making it easy to get great audio quality on the go. The sound profile is both boomy, with added bass boost, and clear in the mid and high frequencies, making for an excellent portable sound that also boasts a long-lasting battery. JBL says you can get up to 16 hours of battery life with the Playback Boost setting, and for those who prefer to customize their audio, the JBL mobile app also features a multi-band EQ (though most devices now also include their own built-in EQ settings, if you prefer that).</p> ]]></dc:content>

Cyber Monday occurs a few days later, on December 1st, and you can expect that entire weekend to be full of great deals on tech and other products. Of course, many retailers will be running early deals in preparation for the event, so I'm hard at work gathering all of the best discounts for Android users so you don't miss anything.</p><h2 id="should-i-wait-until-black-friday-to-shop-for-new-tech-2">Should I wait until Black Friday to shop for new tech?</h2><p>It's up to you! While Black Friday weekend generally showcases some of the best deals of the year, it's not unusual for retailers like Best Buy and Amazon to drop a small selection of their discounts early (such as the offerings detailed above). It's always nice to get your holiday shopping done early, but if you have the time, it'll be worth keeping an eye on our site to see the latest Android deals as they go live.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung's Galaxy XR is the hot new VR headset in town, seamlessly blending the real and virtual worlds into a compelling XR space. But this headset isn't some boring old PC VR headset that you need a computer to operate. It's a fully standalone computer that you can comfortably wear for hours at a time, and that's why it's replacing my main workstation setup this year.</p><p>That might sound crazy, but there's something spectacularly amazing about being able to put my monitors anywhere I want without setting up mounting hardware. Not only that, but they can be resized and <em>reshaped</em>, so I can have an ultra-ultra-ultrawide monitor, a tall monitor, or even a square monitor if I really wanted to.</p><p>This same concept applies to any Android app you want to run on the headset. If you've used a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, you'll already be familiar with how app window resizing works. Since the Galaxy XR runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, a new version of Android specifically designed for XR devices, it can also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-secret-sauce-behind-samsungs-galaxy-xr-headset">run <em>all</em> Google Play apps</a> without developers specifically needing to build an app for the headset.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-floating-windows-chrome-official" alt="Three floating windows in an Android XR mixed reality environment with Chrome in the middle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's a massive improvement over every other VR or XR headset on the market and it also means that I can seamlessly run Android apps alongside the monitors for my Windows 11 laptop without skipping a beat. Since I'm knee-deep in the Google ecosystem, this means all my devices can tie into my Galaxy XR experience without me having to fiddle around.</p><p>Folks using a Galaxy XR to work on their PCs have two main options: use a Samsung GalaxyBook, which has built-in hooks to connect to Galaxy XR, or download <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=virtualdesktop.android">the Virtual Desktop app</a> from the Google Play Store. Virtual Desktop has been my preferred PC-to-VR connection software for years and it works on any platform you want to use, from PCs to Macs, and even different wireless VR headsets.</p><p>Samsung specifically worked with the developer of Virtual Desktop to ensure the highest quality "Monster" resolution and bitrate were available from day-one on Galaxy XR. If you've got a Wi-Fi 7 router, that experience will be even better thanks to the ultra-high bandwidth and low latency of these next-gen networking powerhouses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kr7mzDHWSJvi8ZroNu954H" name="Gemini-on-Android- XR" alt="Planning your vacation with Gemini on Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kr7mzDHWSJvi8ZroNu954H.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The app supports up to 3 virtual monitors streaming from your PC, all of which are resizable and scalable as I previously noted. Virtual Desktop can also be used to easily play SteamVR games on your PC, adding one more feather to its proverbial hat.</p><p>Since these virtual monitors simply "float" in real space, I can sit anywhere I'd like and still have my <strong>full</strong> desk setup. That means at my dining room table, on my couch, on a plane, in an airport, a hotel, or even my in-laws house. That's a powerful way to work, especially if you have the freedom of working remotely.</p><p>On the entertainment side of things, I'm a huge proponent for portable devices. I got rid of my gaming PC years ago for a Steam Deck, and I primarily play console games on systems like the Nintendo Switch 2 since I can undock it and play anywhere I want.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AjkRtN6tMb3KfycbnaeemL" name="Galaxy-XR-Side-Profile" alt="side profile of the Galaxy XR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AjkRtN6tMb3KfycbnaeemL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3938" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Galaxy XR provides the same level of freedom with a metric ton of available content. Not only do you get access to every game in the Google Play Store, but you also have access to the best streaming services like GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass, and more. There are even apps to stream your home consoles — like a PS5 — to the headset.</p><p>And while I love <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">a good handheld gaming console</a>, this experience trumps that one since you don't have to look down at a device or hold it up for long periods of time, alleviating a common source of strain during long gaming sessions. That screen can be placed anywhere you want and it never has to be held up. It's a win-win!</p><p>None of this would even be worthwhile without a good display or comfortable build but, thankfully, Galaxy XR has those angles covered, too. The design is made to keep all the weight off your face, ensuring that your cheeks don't feel heavy after just a few minutes and that it's easy to eat and drink while wearing the headset. You probably didn't think about that part until just now, but it's a problem the Galaxy XR's open side design solves.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ebcTjVdZCsPrWGp4cRhXee" name="virtual-desktop-theater" alt="Watching Limitless in a virtual movie theater using the Virtual Desktop app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ebcTjVdZCsPrWGp4cRhXee.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Virtual Desktop)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the highest-resolution micro-OLED displays on any wireless headset to date, the 29 million pixels of self-emissive glory will light up your content with the deep contrast and colors OLED is known for. Plus, at 90Hz, everything will be buttery smooth.</p><p>I'm not much of a TV watcher, but I know that the plethora of options for streaming and video services on Android will also ensure this is an excellent replacement for any TV, especially since you can take it with you. That theater you see above isn't real; it's a virtual theater from the Virtual Desktop app, and it makes immersive watching a ridulously impressive experience.</p><p>Imagine having the best display you've probably ever seen with you anywhere you go, with the ability to run all your favorite apps and services on it when you want it. That's Galaxy XR.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7925fdd7-4885-409e-8219-c0bf5eda6573">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:66.67%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cxXQANwssegypWVFB9SYcS.jpg' alt="Galaxy XR side profile"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Samsung</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Galaxy XR</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Get the best micro-OLED display on any wireless XR headset with the power of Android XR, all inside the comfortable Galaxy XR from Samsung.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Before I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">tested Galaxy XR in New York</a>, I suspected Samsung would ignore gaming and focus on making it a "serious" XR device. But after Samsung reps showed off Stardew Valley, No Man's Sky, and traditional VR games on the headset, I was intrigued. And the more I've learned about the headset, the more convinced I am that it's a genuine, unique gaming device I'd love to use.</p><p>VR fans will find a decent list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/samsung-galaxy-xr-android-xr-games/" target="_blank">Android XR launch titles</a>, with some personal faves like Walkabout Mini Golf, Synth Riders, and Demeo, plus some workout titles like FitXR to turn Galaxy XR into an immersive gym. It supports Unity and the OpenXR standard most VR games use, so I'm certain the list will grow quickly.</p><p>But as gorgeous as these games will look on a Micro-OLED, 3,552 x 3,840 resolution display, that alone wouldn't get me to spend the $1,799 to get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Galaxy XR</a>. It's the combination of XR games, Android app support, wireless PC connectivity, multitasking UI, and wide field of view (FoV) that could turn Galaxy XR into a premium gaming monitor and accessory rolled into one device.</p><h2 id="galaxy-xr-is-designed-for-multitasking-gamers-like-me-2">Galaxy XR is designed for multitasking gamers like me</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="b25Ee4cvFzaByJVywx5Kbf" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-workspace-official" alt="A man wearing a Samsung Galaxy XR interacting with floating windows using his hands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b25Ee4cvFzaByJVywx5Kbf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="676" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gamers buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handheld consoles</a> because they enjoy Android games like COD: Mobile, Genshin Impact, or Roblox on a larger display with better controls and max graphics. Galaxy XR dials that concept up to 11, with virtual, TV-sized displays, flagship-level performance, and Bluetooth compatibility with most controllers.</p><p>The powerful Snapdragon chip with 16GB of RAM is overkill for most mobile games, but Galaxy XR's secret weapon is its boundary-free space for multitasking. During several gaming demos, Samsung paired games with other demanding apps like Google Meet for online multiplayer chat, YouTube for walkthroughs, Gemini for gameplay advice, or a music app for ambience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xZHJhRAguzUhSkXzJGeDtM" name="Galaxy-XR-stardew-valley" alt="A photo of a Samsung engineer playing Stardew Valley on stage at a Samsung Galaxy XR event, wearing the headset while speaking to friends on a Google Meet call." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xZHJhRAguzUhSkXzJGeDtM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>PC gamers can accomplish this multitasking effect with multiple monitors and a powerful rig. Galaxy XR recreates this effect, except you can stack windows <em>vertically</em> so it's easier to keep both in your vision at once, or use <em>more</em> than two windows. And you can play it anywhere, including in bed.</p><p>I like to keep my brain occupied while gaming, but I'm typically restricted to audio-only options like a podcast. With Galaxy XR, I could arrange more content to fit in my direct vision as I play. I could see myself enjoying a basketball livestream while playing a sandbox game where I don't need to react quickly, flitting my gaze between them. Or if I'm playing a more active game, I could binge a TV show I've seen before in a smaller window, so I'm only partially paying attention.</p><p>I also have occasional online multiplayer sessions with old friends, during which we normally use Discord for audio; if, instead, I could video-call with them and see them in my peripheral vision, it would feel more like the old days where we played games in one room.</p><h2 id="galaxy-xr-goes-beyond-android-gaming-2">Galaxy XR goes beyond Android gaming</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="M8E9jXaETRhiuqkWo7J8fM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-controllers-2" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset's controllers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M8E9jXaETRhiuqkWo7J8fM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since all Android apps are supported, you can stream games on GeForce Now, Xbox Game Pass, or PS Remote Play, giving you access to a wider range of titles. I only wish Google would bring back Stadia, which would be the perfect fit for this headset.</p><p>If cloud gaming uses too much bandwidth, Galaxy XR can sync wirelessly with your PC using the "Game Link" feature, unlocking your full Steam library of normal and PC VR titles at up to a respectable 90Hz — impressive given the 29 million pixels the headset has to refresh constantly.</p><p>An alternative option is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=virtualdesktop.android">Virtual Desktop</a> app, which pairs with your PC for work or play, and can take the headset's native eye, face, and hand tracking and pass it onto social VR games like VRChat.</p><p>Early Galaxy XR adopters have already started playing beloved titles like Half-Life: Alyx on the headset, with no wire to the PC required. And it's particularly cool that Galaxy XR supports Wi-Fi 7, reducing any latency between your PC and headset. Even though PC VR is a fairly niche ecosystem, I think Galaxy XR will certainly appeal to that crowd on the strength of its hardware.</p><h2 id="will-gemini-help-the-galaxy-xr-experience-2">Will Gemini help the Galaxy XR experience?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zN4WmfGqM8osgjhSJiNi2N" name="Galaxy-XR-No-Man's-Sky" alt="A photo of a Samsung engineer playing No Man's Sky on the Galaxy XR headset using a Bluetooth gamepad, with his headset feed visible on a screen behind him." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zN4WmfGqM8osgjhSJiNi2N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>During the Galaxy XR demo, a Samsung rep shared his No Man's Sky gameplay window and asked Gemini how to accomplish his next task; the assistant answered with controls and walkthrough advice. It then gave suggestions on what he could do next on that alien world, when asked.</p><p>I'm not sure how well Gemini's multimodal software can interpret gameplay beyond the basics, yet, but it's an intriguing use case, one that could lead to real-time "coaching" in the distant future. For now, you can use Circle to Search to highlight something in-game and ask Gemini about it, which might be fun for a historical title like Assassin's Creed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wZuBiaWGgJDmXmCaRxTWrM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-on-face" alt="A photo of the author wearing a Samsung Galaxy XR headset." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wZuBiaWGgJDmXmCaRxTWrM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, I think that Galaxy XR could be an excellent gaming device, and I'm looking forward to putting it through its paces.

But since a lot of my potential gaming use cases involve traditional 2D gaming in a virtual space, I don't mind using my current Bluetooth controllers (or hand tracking) until they become available.</p><p>Based on my early testing, it's lightweight enough that I can see myself playing with it for hours, the visual fidelity is gorgeous, passthrough stops me from feeling isolated, and the UI to move windows around is seamless.

In either case, Lenovo says it'll net users up to 11 hours of battery life per charge, while also offering a wide range of connectivity options including two USB-C ports, a USB-A port, a 3.5mm headphone and mic jack, a microSD slot for expandable storage, and a Kensington lock.</p><p>It doesn't feature an upgraded configuration like most Chromebook options, although if 128GB of storage isn't a dealbreaker for you, then this is a pretty great price point.

I've long said that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-wish-the-fairphone-5-was-coming-to-the-us">this is something I wanted to see</a>, and when it happens, I'm on board. Now I get to spend $909, but I'm finally getting what I've been wanting for years.</p><p>If you're like me and excited over the news, make sure you know a few things about it before you start clicking things at Murena's website.</p><p><strong>It's $200 more than the model offered for most of the world</strong>. 😬</p><p><strong>It's not going to work on many 3G networks in North America</strong>.</p><p><strong>The version being sold in North America is running the</strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/eos-review-privacy-focused-android-without-google"><strong> /e/OS operating system.</strong></a></p><p><strong>It's not going to work on Verizon</strong> because of the lack of band 66, and <strong>not very well on AT&T</strong> (or Rogers) because not many mid-band networks are supported. It's good to go for T-Mobile's network, so if you're team pink or use an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO</a>, you're set. There is zero support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">mmWave networks</a> in case you were wondering.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rLdnBXvAf3VCzncqtrQGs8" name="Murena-Fairphone-Gen-6-02" alt="Fairphone (Gen 6)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rLdnBXvAf3VCzncqtrQGs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With that out of the way (sorry to rain on anyone's parade), let's talk about the reason I'm willing to pry open my wallet and order one: I love what Fairphone is doing and what it's trying to do to this greedy, horrible industry.</p><p>You shouldn't be shopping for a Fairphone because of its specs. They're decidedly average and mid-range, powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s</a> (Gen 3). The only thing flagship about the Fairphone 6 is its price: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://murena.com/america/shop/smartphones/brand-new/murena-fairphone-6/#tech-spec" target="_blank">$899 before shipping</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NisoxgPDytWkz5KPzmGyxj" name="Fairphone-6-Murena" alt="The Murena Fairphone Gen 6 against a gradient background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NisoxgPDytWkz5KPzmGyxj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Murena / Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But if you want to support a company that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-is-doing-its-part-to-make-the-world-a-better-place-is-it-enough">consistently does the right thing at the right times</a>, this is the phone for you. The company behind it all actually seems to care about both the people involved in making it and the people buying it.</p><p>We make a big fuss when Google or Samsung offers a phone that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sustainable-repairable-phones">not impossible to repair</a>, but their offerings pale when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-ifixit-perfect-repairability-score">compared to the Fairphone</a>. One screwdriver can change most of the parts that would potentially break or go bad, which means you can take advantage of years of support. I know this because I've completely disassembled several Fairphones, and they worked when I put them back together. Often that's not the case. R.I.P. LG G2, G3, and G4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:936px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="2jy7v7kwrFBn2XHfRL9pHk" name="Fairphone-6-internals" alt="The Fairphone 6 internals" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2jy7v7kwrFBn2XHfRL9pHk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="936" height="527" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fairphone knows that the people who make building a phone possible need to be compensated.

The only reason an old Fairphone ends up in a landfill is that one of us was too lazy to send it back for complete recycling.</p><p>Finally, it honestly seems like the company wants me to use and enjoy its products as much as it wants to sell me a new one. All Fairphone phones have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fairphone-3-gets-android-13-update">supported for years longer than anyone thought possible</a>. Parts are super easy to replace and cheap to purchase. The company makes it possible for you to keep using what you bought for years. That matters to me; the decision to buy a new phone shouldn't be forced upon you because a manufacturer simply decided to stop supporting a product.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="r9fATuS9QeJmq2kTWQXEr8" name="Murena-Fairphone-Gen-6-01" alt="Fairphone (Gen 6)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r9fATuS9QeJmq2kTWQXEr8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, this adds up, and the phone is expensive as all get out. Paying $899 for this phone would be crazy if it came from Google, Apple, or Samsung. I could also be wrong, and the company is really good at setting a trap for folks like me who want to see the mobile industry shaken up and dumped on its head. I don't think Fairphone or Murena or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wonder-what-life-is-like-without-google-or-apple-you-need-to-try-this-alternative">/e Foundation</a> is trying to scam me, though.</p><p>I trust them because everything they have shown me deserves their trust.

While it’s the app you rely on most when you’re lost or on a long road trip, it’s the same app that will chew through your battery, possibly leaving you stranded with a black screen. While your phone’s system-wide battery saver mode tries to help, it often makes things worse by limiting GPS activity precisely when you need it.</p><p>Google has finally heard our collective cries, with the company potentially developing a dedicated power-saving mode built directly into the Google Maps app for Android, and it takes a hardcore approach to keeping your phone alive.</p><p>Early code spotted by the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-maps-power-saving-3611409/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> suggests it’s a complete rethinking of how Maps behaves when your phone’s running low. The feature was spotted in the latest Google Maps for Android (version 25.44.03.824313610), where code strings reference a “Power saving mode” that shows only “key information such as next turns.”</p><p>Instead of relying on your phone’s general battery saver, Maps’ built-in mode is designed to preserve what matters: navigation. Once enabled, the screen reportedly switches to a monochrome view, ditching its colorful visuals and other interface elements.</p><h2 id="strips-to-the-essentials-2">Strips to the essentials</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:987px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.31%;"><img id="ZA5CHRF8M4tLwLqhmSD4Ta" name="Google-Maps-power-saving-mode" alt="monochrome view of Google Maps' new power saving mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZA5CHRF8M4tLwLqhmSD4Ta.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="987" height="694" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The app still displays essentials like your next turn, distance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps/google-maps-is-giving-your-eta-screen-a-glow-up-on-android">estimated time of arrival</a>, but trims away everything else to cut down on power use. This new mode could be triggered by pressing the power button during navigation, which would make activating it quick and intuitive.</p><p>Early strings suggest this mode works across driving, walking, and two-wheeler navigation, though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-wear-os-public-transit-directions-rollout">public transit routes</a> might not be supported yet. It also appears that the feature runs independently from Android’s system-wide battery saver, meaning you can use it anytime, even when your regular saver mode is off.</p><p>This could be very helpful for anyone who needs Maps to last on long trips or hikes. There are some downsides, though. Landscape mode might not work, which could be a problem for drivers who use their phones sideways. The black-and-white display might also make it harder to see things like traffic or highlighted routes, but it’s a fair trade for more battery life.</p><p>While there’s no official release date yet, it could arrive in a future beta before landing in the stable version. Once it rolls out, it could be one of those small but genuinely useful updates that make a real difference the next time you’re navigating with 5% battery left and no charger in sight.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Both speakers headline Amazon’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/amazon-ai-powered-echo-series-devices-blend-alexa-plus-omnisence">next generation of smart devices powered by Alexa+</a>, the company’s more conversational AI assistant that’s shaping the future of its smart-home ecosystem.</p><p>The Echo Dot Max is the most ambitious version of the Dot yet. It’s built as a two-way speaker system with a dedicated woofer and tweeter, delivering nearly three times the bass of the previous Echo Dot (5th Gen). Inside, the new AZ3 chip helps Alexa hear and respond faster, with improved wake-word detection and on-device processing that handles local AI tasks more efficiently.</p><p>The Dot Max also supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a>, Zigbee, and Thread, turning it into a smart-home hub right out of the box. Priced at $100, it’s a surprisingly capable little speaker that can stand on its own, or pair with other Echo devices for stereo or multi-room setups.</p><p>Then there’s the Echo Studio, which now returns in a refreshed form. Despite being 40% smaller than the original model, it packs a high-excursion woofer and three full-range drivers, backed by Dolby Atmos and spatial audio support. It’s powered by Amazon’s beefier AZ3 Pro chip, which handles more complex on-device AI models for quicker responses and smarter audio tuning.</p><p>You can plug the new Studio neatly into Amazon’s growing Alexa Home Theater setup, so you can link up to five <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-alexa-device">Echo speakers</a> or pair them with a Fire TV.

The first Thief game in more than a decade is making its VR debut on December 4, 2025 on PlayStation VR2, Meta Quest, and Steam VR platforms. Better yet, it's just $29.99! That's a lot less than many people were expecting.</p><p>The trailer below shows the first-ever recorded Meta Quest 3 gameplay, proving that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkhan Shadow</a> isn't the only good looking major Meta Quest title where you can lurk in the shadows. In fact, I had a hard time telling the difference between the Meta Quest trailer below and the nearly identical <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fnVOjgm9mQ">PlayStation VR2 trailer</a> for the game. That's an excellent sign for Quest players!</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aiZrchX2pZ8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>As was the case with Batman Arkham Shadow, Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow is developed by VR developers first and likely wouldn't exist at all if it were up to Eidos to make a new Thief game. Vertigo Games, popular for the Arizona Sunshine series and last year's Metro VR game, co-developed Thief VR with Maze Theory, known for their work on Peaky Blinders VR and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/mixed-reality-games-getting-good">The Infinite Inside</a>.</p><p>As such, you can expect this to be the work of veteran VR developers who know how to make a VR-focused title. Surprisingly, despite the high-profile name, Thief VR is launching at just $29.99 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/thief-vr-legacy-of-shadow/6429437293824115/">can be preordered now</a> for a 10% discount, making it just $26.99. That's an unheard-of price for such a title and makes it Vertigo's cheapest big name launch ever.</p><p>If you don't already have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S</a> headset, I recommend waiting until closer to Black Friday for a good sale. We've seen the Quest 3S go on sale for $250 several times recently, and there's a big chance we could see the Quest 3 get a sale this year, too!</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-97">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>Retroid has announced the Pocket G2 and the Pocket 6.</li><li>The Pocket G2 is already available for purchase, and is on sale for the next two weeks.</li><li>After initially announcing the Pocket 6, Retroid reversed course due to community feedback.</li></ul><p>Surprisingly enough, it's been about a year since the Retroid Pocket 5 and Pocket Mini were announced by Retroid. Both handhelds were powered by the Snapdragon 865, marking them as the two most powerful gaming handhelds to come from the company. And earlier this week, two new devices were introduced, as the Pocket G2 and Pocket 6 are slated to be the next Retroid flagships.</p><p>Starting with the Pocket G2, this is essentially just the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/retroid-teases-its-next-gaming-handheld-by-proclaiming-the-future-is-now">Retroid Pocket 5</a>, but with a fresh coat of paint and some upgraded internals. Namely, the Snapdragon 865 is being replaced by the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2, which was announced at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gdc-2025-brings-about-new-qualcomm-chips-and-android-gaming-handhelds" target="_blank">GDC 2025</a> alongside the G3 Gen 3, and G1 Gen 2. In terms of performance, it seems that the the G2 Gen 2 falls between the Snapdragon 865 and the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ndOilwcOq4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Some of the other Pocket G2 specs include 8GB of RAM, 128GB of expandable storage, and a 5,000mAh battery. Arguably the best part about this, besides getting a brand new chip, is that Retroid is sticking with the same 5.5-inch AMOLED display from the Pocket 5, which is an absolute delight.</p><p>What makes this so exciting is that you can get a brand new chip, in a brand new handheld that sports an AMOLED display, all for under $200. The Pocket G2 retails for $219, but for the next two weeks, Retroid is dropping the price down to $199.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v8nToka5jbpAdGZAY2zY5C" name="retroid-pocket-g2-colors" alt="Retroid Pocket G2 Color Options render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8nToka5jbpAdGZAY2zY5C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And then there's the Retroid Pocket 6.</p><p>Getting the fun stuff out of the way first, the Pocket 6 will be Retroid's new flagship handheld, as it's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. This is the "darling" of the emulation community, as it powered the AYN Odin 2, Odin 2 Mini, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayn-odin-2-portal-announced">Odin 2 Portal</a>, three of the most popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a> over the past few years.</p><p>However, in true Retroid fashion, not everyone was happy with the Pocket 6, and it had nothing to do with the spec sheet. Especially considering that the 8GB/128GB model was priced at $229 with a 12GB/256GB variant coming in at $279. Instead, this time around, it was all about the design.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ikzi5ZVULADZS5ZQwqEi5C" name="retroid-pocket-6-specs-original-design" alt="Retroid Pocket 6 specs overview with original design renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ikzi5ZVULADZS5ZQwqEi5C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was pretty immediately apparent that Retroid was trying to do something a bit different, while also trying to appeal to as broad of an audience as possible. To some, myself included, Retroid nailed it, as the design was reminscent of a modern PSP or PS Vita, just with better ergonomics and a unique set of buttons below the screen.</p><p>Sadly, the community did not agree. It reached a tipping point, as the polls were posted to both the Retroid Discord and X accounts, in an attempt to figure out what the community wanted. In the poll, renders of the original Pocket 6 were shared, alongside what a potential redesign would look like.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Which design (pictured above) would you prefer<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1983182653311607021">October 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>With almost 10,000 votes just on the X Poll, almost 70% voted in favor of the redesign. As such, this redesign removed the buttons from below the screen, placing two of them below the left and right joysticks, and the other two on the back.</p><p>The potential problem here is that ultimately, the Retroid Pocket 6 looks pretty similar to both the AYN Odin 3 and Retroid Pocket 5. So instead of getting a handheld that stands out from the pack, the community decided to opt for more of a cookie-cutter design.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/EqtWrMHQsn<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1983893104479629335">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>While disappointing, this entire saga did result in Retroid doing something it hasn't done before. Once pre-orders re-open for the Pocket 6, in addition to the redesign, Retroid is also letting you choose the layout for the left D-Pad and joystick. This is a first for the company, and is actually a pretty great idea when you think about it.</p><p>It's also already been confirmed that customer service will reach out to those who pre-ordered based on the original design, while some have already been refunded.

A new report has found that Android users are more likely to avoid scam text messages than iPhone users.</p><p>Google partnered with YouGov to survey around 5,000 smartphone users in the US, India, and Brazil to study how different phones handle spam texts. Surprisingly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/10/how-android-protects-you-from-scams.html">company found</a> that Android users reported fewer scam and fraudulent messages thanks to AI detection tools on their devices compared to iPhones.</p><p>The report found that Android users were 58% more likely than iOS users to report not receiving any scam texts in the week preceding the survey. The advantage on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a> was even greater, with owners 96% more likely than iPhone users to report zero scam texts.</p><p>Moreover, Android users were 20% more likely than iOS users to describe their device's scam protection as "very effective" or "extremely effective." Compared to Pixel owners, iPhone users were 150% more likely to say their device wasn't effective at all in blocking mobile fraud.</p><h2 id="iphones-falls-behind-android-smartphones-in-scam-prevention-2">iPhones falls behind Android smartphones in scam prevention</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.25%;"><img id="uUnfTN7QR5LSYw2n5avYvL" name="android-scam-detection-and-protection-2" alt="Stats of AI-powered scam detection on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uUnfTN7QR5LSYw2n5avYvL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="996" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.50%;"><img id="yGCBRoU6Uzv5VMrhrh9VwL" name="android-scam-detection-and-protection-1" alt="Stats of AI-powered scam detection on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGCBRoU6Uzv5VMrhrh9VwL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1480" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>While this study was conducted by Google, independent research by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/assessing-the-state-of-ai-powered-mobile-security-blog">Counterpoint</a> revealed that Android phones also have stronger AI-powered protections.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/first-official-look-at-samsung-trifold-phone">Galaxy Z Trifold</a> will be officially launched soon. Well, here is if you live in one of the markets where the phone will likely launch; that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-wild-trifold-phone-is-almost-here-but-you-cant-have-it">doesn't include North America</a>. Of course, nothing is official until it's said out loud and made official, but I don't see any indication of a worldwide launch. That's smart.</p><p>Supposedly, the Trifold is set to launch in a handful of Asian markets with no word on a release anywhere else, which is exactly what Samsung needs to do with this one. You really only need to remember the launch of the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-comparison">Galaxy Z Fold</a> to understand why. The phone was generally well-received, but even more so in places like South Korea and less so in the U.S. There are three reasons why.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="LyRSfFksQtBk5J5zxM6r7T" name="galaxy-fold-martian-green-open-aod-crease.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyRSfFksQtBk5J5zxM6r7T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><h2 id="why-western-markets-might-be-skipped-2">Why western markets might be skipped</h2><p>The first is the price. I can't tell you what a U.S. MSRP of the Galaxy Z Trifold would be, but I can tell you it would be sky high. Like $2,500+ range. Maybe that's not a bad price because of the cost to design and build it (especially the initial model), but most people aren't going to think like that. They will see a giant price and scoff, which isn't good for business. When consumers start to think of high prices when considering a brand of product, they look at others a little more.</p><p>Next, there are going to be problems. Honestly, I don't think the device will have too many issues, but a first generation that's this complicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-are-tri-fold-phones-inherently-weak"><em>has</em> to have a few</a>. A few issues with a device that costs as much as a used car aren't going to sit well. It shouldn't sit well. Besides the bad press and pictures of faulty foldables, the stigma that the original Fold had of being a "bad product" lasted longer than it should have. Even now, many feel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-will-foldable-phones-ever-be-durable">foldables are fragile</a>, finicky devices that aren't going to last as long as it takes to pay them off. All this was because a handful of the first ones sold were plastered all over social media, showing their problems.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.00%;"><img id="pqMoqKxXFd7xQM8VKZJAJT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-4" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pqMoqKxXFd7xQM8VKZJAJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="427" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="a-perfect-mix-early-adopters-and-curious-consumers-in-asia-2">A perfect mix early adopters and curious consumers in Asia</h2><p>Now let's talk about the Asian market. Specifically, Samsung's homeland of South Korea. Any issues are going to affect these phones just like they would in the U.S. The price is going to be crazy high, just like it would be in North America or Europe. None of that will change, but the response to them would.</p><p>Asian tech consumers are savvy, maybe more savvy than most of us, because they are exposed to all sorts of products we don't get to see in the West. They will see the problems, know it's priced very high, and want it anyway.</p><p>The tech culture for much of Asia is different from ours, and many consumers are ready to try something new and know that it will cost them. In the U.S, we call those people "early adopters," and there are a few. There are more of them in other parts of the world, though.</p><p>In South Korea specifically, there is another thing: national pride. If Samsung were a North American company, things would be identical, and Americans would take pride in supporting the largest maker of electronics the world has ever seen. Samsung deserves it.</p><p>This pride in knowing the best devices come from "home" won't make issues go away, but it will make them more accepted. We know this because a lot of people bought American cars in the 1970s and '80s, even though a superior product was available from Japan or Europe. It was a sense of national pride, and buying "American" was important.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uxXRHZUDqc8RXw9JWFUXtH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uxXRHZUDqc8RXw9JWFUXtH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/foldables-arent-really-small-phone-youve-been-looking-yet">I'm looking forward</a> to checking out a good "trifold" Android phone, and chances are it will be one from Samsung. What can I say? I hate a lot of what the company does, but I also think they make the best consumer electronics money can buy.</p><p>I don't look forward to spending too much to do it and being plagued with problems that might not be fixable in a first-generation product. I want to see version two, or maybe even version three. For that to happen, version one has to be a success, and keeping it in Asia, close to home, is a good move to help it become one.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After installing, users hopping into their Gboard Preferences should find the new "Flick keys to enter symbols" feature. This feature is toggleable, meaning you don't need to have it on if you dislike it. Google explains that, if this is turned on, users can "touch a key and pull downward to enter its hinted symbol."</p><p>This "pull downward" action should be quick—like a flick. However, Google has implemented a sensitivity option, so users can get the action how they want it.</p><p>While the term "hinted" symbol may seem strange, what this refers to are the extra icons seen at the top right corner of the keyboard letters. This, most significantly, concerns the top row of letters: Q, W, E, R, T, Y, U, I, O, and P. Each letter features numbers one through zero, which can be typed via a flick, instead of the usual sub-menu.</p><p>The publication states that the update seems to be widely rolled out, as of this week, so users should begin noticing it more consistently, too.</p><h2 id="gboard-s-on-a-streak-2">Gboard's on a streak</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:578px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:103.81%;"><img id="zHtR6m3WCmG7hW9TbDFsLk" name="gboard-flick-for-hinted-symbols" alt="Gboard has rolled out an update for Android that brings a "flick keys to enter symbols," which concerns the numbers on the top row of letters on the keyboard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zHtR6m3WCmG7hW9TbDFsLk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="578" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the second update to hit Gboard in a week, as the other patch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gboard-update-gives-android-users-more-control-over-their-keyboard-setup">brought a more minimalistic keyboard</a> to Android users. Keyboards can look a bit busy, but Google tried to turn that down by giving users the option to hide punctuation marks. New toggles brought the choice to hide the period and comma keys, which makes the spacebar wider at the bottom.</p><p>It's an update that may not appeal to everyone, as you might still want those punctuation marks (especially if you're writing a bunch).</p><p>Gboard also marked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gboard-download-milestone-shortcut-ui-update">a major achievement</a> this year: 10 billion downloads. It's become an Android classic by this point, and users are still flocking toward the keyboard to this day. To go along with the celebrations, Google rolled out a small update for Gboard that changed its Shortcut UI. The UI now flows seamlessly into your Android's coloring scheme, making it feel a little more modern, despite the app's original launch (pre-rebrand) back in 2013.</p><p>Let's also not forget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/june-2024-android-feature-drop">the massive updates</a> that hit Gboard and its Emoji Kitchen that brought sticker combinations for endless emotional creativity.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It announced two new tools today (Oct.29) to help you keep the comment section clean, on track, rather than having unnecessary trolls take over your post.</p><p>First up is "reply approvals," while this will need more intervention from you, it will help keep things as civil as possible in your Threads posts.  Users will not be able to choose which replies appear publicly, even before the comment gets linked to your post for the world to see. Users will see a list of comments waiting for your approval within the app, so that they show up on your Thread.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FD8WC4a6fhV3GYUzdtKwVK" name="Threads-Reply-approvals" alt="Meta announces ways to tackle trolls on Threads" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FD8WC4a6fhV3GYUzdtKwVK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Each reply can be approved or ignored individually. For efficiency, users can also do so with all pending replies at once, whether it's designating them as acceptable or all spam. You can also toggle on or off approvals for individual posts and review replies at your own pace.</p><p>Meta is also expanding ways you can filter your activity feed. Users can now filter replies to see "people they follow" or those with mentions. This makes it easier to keep track of relevant conversations, especially for high-activity influencer or business accounts. "This way, you can surface the replies you care about most and focus on the discussions you’re interested in," the company added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AnzQUBv222jcjqwGHZhKVK" name="Threads-Reply-approvals" alt="Meta announces ways to tackle trolls on Threads" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AnzQUBv222jcjqwGHZhKVK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These tools make their way along with the recently announced "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/threads-adds-vanishing-ghost-posts-on-a-timer-for-those-one-off-hot-takes">ghost posts</a>" feature, which gives users the ability to designate a certain thread as a "ghost post," making it vanish within 24 hours. Meta states this is something users can use as a way to be "unfiltered" and post "fresh takes/thoughts" without "the pressure of permanence or polish."</p><p>Additionally, Threads rolled out another update that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/threads-is-rolling-out-group-chats-and-expands-messaging-to-the-eu">brought group chat support</a> to the app, which allows people to engage in group chats with up to 50 people. It also provides the option to customize your chat name while it prepares invite links for more people. Messaging others on Threads now also supports photos, videos, GIFs, and stickers, as well as "smart" privacy options.</p> ]]></dc:content>

T-Mobile 5G Home Internet is often recommended among the staff here at Android Central because it's fast, affordable, and comes with loads of useful perks. Bundle the internet with one of the T-Mo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">mobile plans</a>, and you might even be eligible for additional savings.

All-In starts at $75 per month but can be dropped to as little as $55 per month when you bundle with mobile, while the Rely and Amplified plans can be knocked down to as little as $35 and $45 if you play your cards right. </p><p>Needless to say, 5G Home Internet will never be as fast as fiber, but if you're already a T-Mobile user and you're looking for a good deal on internet, this is an unmissable opportunity. Just be aware that the free gift card expires after six months, so don't wait too long to redeem that sweet, sweet Mastercard cash.

According to Vats, Samsung has pushed an update for its internal test that supposedly makes the Quick Settings menu icons "pop." Samsung has included a soft, black border around the menu's icons that only serves to bring them off the screen a little bit.</p><p>While Samsung's current One UI 8 Quick Settings (and UI in general) is quite clean, one could make the argument that it doesn't pop. It assumes that blurred, clean aesthetic across its entirety, but this small update tries to breathe separation into the equation.</p><p>From what Vats discovered, the pop is just for the toggleable icons, as the containers for the icons are still blurred. Even the sliders remain pretty much the same as what we currently have with v8.0. All in all, the small change gives us <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">Apple Liquid Glass</a> vibes, just with how one little change provides that pop of separation.</p><h2 id="still-on-the-outside-looking-in-2">Still on the outside looking in</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exclusive 🔥One UI 8.5 YJO now adds outline design to toggles in the Quick Panel 👀✨A small change — but it makes the whole panel look cleaner and more polished! pic.twitter.com/yJwjr1UXWp<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1983778188611481856">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>It might hurt being on the outside looking in, but it looks like that might be the case for a while, as reports claim Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-reportedly-delayed">had to delay its One UI 8.5 beta</a>. Original rumors said we might see a beta program kickoff in November, but things have changed, as tipsters now claim that's "unlikely." Nothing's for certain now as to why the company pushed it back, but there's some speculation that it could have to do with its uncertain Galaxy S26 series lineup.</p><p>Specifically, recent reports claim that Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">dropped its Galaxy S26 Edge</a> in favor of returning the S26 Plus to the equation next year. There are also rumors that the S26 series could launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-release-date">later next year</a>, maybe as late as March.</p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-could-finally-match-google-pixel-update-pace-with-one-ui-8-5">reports speculate</a> that Samsung could be moving into a world where it matches Google's update cadence and bring Android to its Galaxy users faster. A few firmware leaks suggest Samsung could shift into quarterly Android updates for Galaxy phones, marking a distinct change, as it typically forgoes such patches.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This "richer" experience Samsung highlights is brought in part by its recent AI enhancements. Samsung Internet's "ambient" AI is said to be "integrated" with the user, much like what you'd find on your handheld device.</p><p>The browser's AI can be personalized to ensure that your specific browsing behavior remains unique to you.</p><p>Aside from this, Samsung touts two major gamechangers with its Internet browser's PC beta: full Galaxy integration and security. Starting with the former, users can synchronize their browsing history, bookmarks, and more between their PC and mobile devices. Through Samsung Pass, your autofilled credentials are right there when you need them. Additionally, those AI features, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/every-android-flagship-should-steal-this-ai-feature-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Browsing Assist</a>, bring webpage translations and summaries.</p><p>Users can also begin browsing a page on their phone and then quickly pick it up on their PC.</p><p>Elsewhere, Samsung highlights "smart anti-tracking." The browser's PC beta brings a feature that "helps block third-party web tracker attempts to collect personal information." The included Privacy Dashboard reportedly gives users a bird's eye view of their online defenses.</p><h2 id="connecting-the-galaxy-like-constellations-2">Connecting the Galaxy, like Constellations</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.10%;"><img id="SLMzKZfmASQtnhSwfLMrZd" name="samsung-internet-on-pc-browsing-data-info" alt="Samsung Internet on PC beta kicks off, enabling users to merge their browsing experiences across their mobile devices and computers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SLMzKZfmASQtnhSwfLMrZd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="521" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're looking to connect your Samsung Internet browsing across devices, you must sign in to your Samsung account beforehand. Beginning today (Oct 30), the post states the Samsung Internet on PC beta is rolling out for Windows 11 and 10 computers in the U.S. and South Korea. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.samsung.com/beta">official beta program</a> sign-up page is live right now, so you can hop in.</p><p>Samsung states that it plans to bring this beta to more areas in the future.</p><p>When we started getting our hands on the Galaxy S25 series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/every-android-flagship-should-steal-this-ai-feature-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung's AI features</a> were a pretty unavoidable highlight, namely because of their privacy. Browsing Assist was among those standouts, as the feature in Samsung Internet could summarize webpages for you in a blink, getting you the info you need faster. However, another key detail was that Galaxy S25 users could have their phone conduct its AI processes completely on-device, instead of reaching for the cloud.</p><p>It's a route that would be nice if Google and Apple made, too, but at least there's one option out there with a choice. Essentially, many of the company's "Assist" features can run entirely on-device, but if you're looking for help with your photos, that'll leave your phone looking for help.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The release of the Galaxy S26 is still a few months away, but I just uncovered a Boost Mobile deal that could you the upcoming flagship for completely free if you play your cards right. The carrier's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.boostmobile.com/plans/infinite-access-for-galaxy"><strong>Infinite Access for Galaxy plan starts at $65 per month and guarantees you $800 off a new Samsung phone upgrade every year indefinitely,</strong></a> not to mention unlimited talk, text, data, international benefits and more.</p><p>Considering that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> is likely to retail for $800, this plan should cover the full price of the phone, and I'm talking about a device that hasn't even been announced yet. </p><p>That said, there is a pretty significant catch. If you take advantage of the deal <em>today</em>, you'll get a free <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> - since that's the current model - but you'll need to hold on to that phone for 12 months before you can claim your free upgrade to the S26. </p><p>Alternatively, you could simply wait until the Galaxy S26 is revealed (presumably) in January to sign up for Boost Mobile's Infinite Access plan, which will guarantee you the new phone instantly. The choice is yours, but either way you're getting a future full of free Galaxy upgrades and a great wireless plan to boot, which is nothing to scoff at. </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="67dd7ee2-4dbb-4686-91cb-dfa7205a287f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile" data-dimension48="Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile" href="https://www.boostmobile.com/plans/infinite-access-for-galaxy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="3yYJ8LxAAtvrYDygDsL6GQ" name="boost-mobile-logo-dish-reco.png" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3yYJ8LxAAtvrYDygDsL6GQ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.boostmobile.com/plans/infinite-access-for-galaxy" data-dimension112="67dd7ee2-4dbb-4686-91cb-dfa7205a287f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile" data-dimension48="Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile" data-dimension25=""><strong>Score $800 OFF Galaxy Z and S series phones every year with the Infinite Access for Galaxy plan at Boost Mobile</strong></a></p><p>Sign up for Boost Mobile's Infinite Access for Galaxy Plan ($65 per month) and you'll be guaranteed $800 off the latest <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> <em>every year </em>you have the plan. </p><p>Both Z and S series devices are eligible, which means you can claim a free Galaxy S25 today (or wait until the Galaxy S26 is announced in a couple of months).

Needless to say, as soon as the phone is unveiled, I'll be hard at work tracking down all of the best deals so you don't have to go looking. </p> ]]></dc:content>

That includes shipping with a relatively uncomfortable cloth strap for your head and an all-plastic design.</p><p>Samsung Galaxy XR, previously known as Project Moohan, has a far more premium look and feel. While some parts are plastic to keep weight down, it looks a lot more like a Meta Quest Pro than a Meta Quest 3. This includes rigid side straps with a wheel on the back for quickly adjusting size, a large, plush pad for the back of your head, and another large plush pad for your forehead.</p><p>Unlike the Meta Quest 3, Galaxy XR doesn't put any weight on your face at all. The rubber light blockers are included in the box and magnetically removable, so you'll feel no pressure on your face while wearing the headset for long periods of time.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2CeenrvW4GFy8T8Y8tncdn" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2CeenrvW4GFy8T8Y8tncdn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AjkRtN6tMb3KfycbnaeemL" name="Galaxy-XR-Side-Profile" alt="side profile of the Galaxy XR headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AjkRtN6tMb3KfycbnaeemL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3938" height="2215" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="B4MnhY68yWPKyJo82LRQ2N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-top-down-on-books" alt="A top-down photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset sitting on a pile of books." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B4MnhY68yWPKyJo82LRQ2N.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tPv9K5mz3qhZKHXHrPF4vM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-back-to-front" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset sitting on a pile of books, angled away to show the lenses and back knob." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tPv9K5mz3qhZKHXHrPF4vM.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The Meta Quest 3's default cloth strap distributes weight on your face and around the sides and back of your head. Some people, like me, find this to be uncomfortable and end up buying a third-party head strap along with several other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> to make it more comfortable to wear.</p><div><blockquote><p>You can swap out the Meta Quest 3's face pad, head strap, and more, ensuring it fits you perfectly.</p></blockquote></div><p>While this sounds like a negative at first, Meta's "modular" design of the Quest 3 means you can take all the important parts off — the head strap, the face pad, etc — and replace them with ones you find more comfortable.</p><p>When I work while wearing a Quest 3, I use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/KIWI-design-Boost-Battery-Compatible/dp/B0D6W88TCN/" target="_blank">Kiwi Design H4 Boost</a> head strap and remove the face pad so the headset's weight isn't resting on my face. Otherwise, when I'm gaming with a Quest 3, I keep the face pad on to provide maximum immersion.</p><p>Galaxy XR isn't explicitly designed to be a modular headset in the same way, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZGFTECH/status/1981174229468070176">that's not stopping some VR </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZGFTECH/status/1981174229468070176" target="_blank">accessory makers</a> from trying to modularize it as much as possible.</p><p>Galaxy XR is powered by a separate battery pack that's attached via a cord on the left side, while the Meta Quest 3 features the battery in the front of the headset with the lenses and all other electronics.

That's a huge advantage for Samsung over any Meta-branded headset, which all require manual IPD adjustment.</p><p>Some headsets, like the PlayStation VR2, will help you choose the right IPD by using eye tracking to display an image you can line up. The Meta Quest 3, like most other VR headsets, requires you to know your IPD ahead of time. Adjusting it on a Quest 3 is easy and can be done via the IPD wheel on the underside of the headset, but you still need to know the right number before using it.</p><p>Both headsets feature crystal-clear pancake lenses with a wide FoV. Galaxy XR uses a 109-degree horizontal FoV, while the Meta Quest 3 has an indistinguishably wider 110-degree horizontal FoV.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="m7b2jYB5d7vaskWS4J9FJU" name="meta-quest-3-vs-samsung-galaxy-xr-controllers" alt="Comparing Samsung Galaxy XR controllers with Meta Quest 3 controllers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m7b2jYB5d7vaskWS4J9FJU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div><blockquote><p>Samsung's headset supports controllers but we haven't seen them yet.</p></blockquote></div><p>The Meta Quest 3 ships with two motion controllers — one is held in each hand — and also supports controller-free hand tracking for more effortless interactions.

Similarly, Android XR, which powers Galaxy XR, is also a specific version of Android built for XR devices. While they sound similar on the surface, there are some key differences to consider.</p><p>While both are based on the Android Open Source Project, Meta Horizon OS features significant layers of customization that Meta has built over the past decade. Meta has built so much on top of Android that it actually packages it as a "separate" operating system, calling it Meta Horizon OS, and now offers it as an option for third-party companies <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-horizon-os-announced-for-3rd-party-quest-headsets-xbox-asus-lenovo">to build their own headsets on</a>.</p><p>Meta Horizon OS not only revolves around the "Meta Horizon experience," which includes promoting the Meta Horizon metaverse app front and center, but also ties Meta services deeply into the OS. Apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Facebook, and Instagram all have native Horizon OS apps, and while a few other apps can be downloaded on the app store, Meta Quest headsets are still mainly gaming consoles with some extra computing functionality.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF" name="android-xr-video-player-ui" alt="A look at the video player UI of Android XR running on a Samsung Project Moohan headset in mixed reality" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Android XR is a more visually polished OS </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android XR is built upon the Android Open Source Project as well but, like most builds of Android, Google services are at the center. Google said Android XR is "the first version of Android built for the Gemini era," which means Google Gemini is able to operate the entire experience if you ask it to.</p><p>Gemini can see what you see, including both the virtual and real world, and is able to answer questions and interact with virtual screens as you see fit. This opens up significant new design and interaction paradigms that we simply haven't seen before. One excellent example of this paradigm shift is using Circle to Search while playing Half-Life: Alyx on a Galaxy XR <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@michaelbtech/post/DQRqJ3fkShj?xmt=AQF0UktWuKWasSvrLVL-QjnnhYjHTLmKMVWtGE9y0LbMtA&slof=1">to translate in-game signs</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bqDoWwKVUFpYpA4vVprVQZ" name="meta-quest-3-horizon-os-ui-jan-2025-multitasking-browser" alt="Multitasking between three browser windows on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bqDoWwKVUFpYpA4vVprVQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both operating systems support native multitasking, giving users the ability to open multiple windows at once and float them anywhere in real 3D space. You can think of these a bit like resizable virtual monitors that you can place anywhere, all of which are able to be interacted with like a smartphone or tablet interface.</p><div><blockquote><p>Both operating systems are designed to enable multitasking in mixed reality, plus allow for full immersive apps and games, but Meta is severely lacking in available apps.</p></blockquote></div><p>Samsung impressed us with the launch of Galaxy XR for many reasons, but the most surprising was the announcement that <em>all</em> Google Play apps work on the headset from day one. That means developers don't need to do anything extra to get their apps in XR, although they can choose to build new XR-specific versions for the headset.</p><p>That's a massive leg-up on Meta, which has struggled to get developers to port apps to its Meta Horizon OS. While there are a handful of 2D apps on the Meta Quest — mostly communication apps — Galaxy XR can run any app your Android-based smartphone or tablet can run. That's an incredible boon for everyday use and ensures Galaxy XR is the ultimate XR productivity device.</p><p>If you want to learn more about how both operating systems compare, see our detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-vs-meta-horizon-os">Android XR vs Meta Horizon OS</a> comparison.</p><h2 id="samsung-xr-vs-meta-quest-3-performance-and-specs-2">Samsung XR vs. Meta Quest 3: Performance and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NitxdTKiUJCdu8inq98q9k" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-gen-2-chip-01.jpg" alt="A placard for the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 SoC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NitxdTKiUJCdu8inq98q9k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon chipsets power the Meta Quest 3 and Samsung Galaxy XR, but Galaxy XR features the more powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2</a>.

This is quickly followed by "Stop using it and get it looked at." Ever wonder why it happens or what's so dangerous about it?</p><p>Hydrogen. It's what causes the swelling, and when hydrogen — a volatile, highly flammable gas — is anywhere near a potential ignition source, some very, <em><strong>very</strong></em> bad things can happen.</p><p>It's not normal, even if it is fairly common, and a lot of tech goes into trying to prevent it. Here's what you need to know about it.</p><h2 id="where-does-the-hydrogen-come-from-2">Where does the hydrogen come from?</h2><p>The batteries used in everything from phones to laptops to electric cars are based on similar technology, with lithium as a common ingredient. This is great because these types of batteries have a relatively large capacity for their size, a fairly long lifespan, and can deliver plenty of power.</p><p>Lithium has another property that's not as good: it can emit hydrogen gas under certain conditions. When combined with the construction of the battery used in things like phones, a battery can turn into a puffy, spicy pillow because it swells.</p><p>I'm going to use a phone battery as an example, but the same applies to the batteries in your smartwatch, smart ring, tablet, and laptop. Common things tech enthusiasts all seem to have.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">battery in your phone</a> is basically a thermoplastic foil pouch. It has a shape because of the components inside it, which divide cells or act as electrodes, but it's still just a foil pouch made of very thin, flexible material. It's also sealed very well, though some batteries, like the behemoths used in EVs,  will have a one-way valve to prevent gas build-up inside this foil casing.</p><p>When you "mistreat" the battery, the lithium produces hydrogen gas as a byproduct. Hydrogen is made of very small particles and will escape through the tiniest of openings most of the time. But a sealed battery — one without a gas escape valve — is usually well sealed enough to prevent gas from escaping.</p><p>When you pump gas into a flexible container and have no way to use it, it builds up. It will eventually cause the foil to stretch and balloon up, often enough to separate a phone's body or even crack the screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="k9owTBaAMjmxoc4MQe8nfg" name="lg-g5-battery-5.jpg" alt="LG G5 battery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9owTBaAMjmxoc4MQe8nfg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I said "mistreat" earlier. It's not hard to force hydrogen release because batteries can be sensitive to external factors. That sounds like doublespeak, but if everything was working properly and the battery stayed under optimal conditions all of the time, it wouldn't happen. What causes it to happen?</p><p><strong>Overcharging, undercharging, and overheating</strong> can all lead to a swollen battery. Plenty of safeguards are in place to try to prevent this, but we still find ways to do it.</p><p><strong>Physical damage</strong> will almost certainly cause it to happen. A battery is designed as a precision component where everything has a place. If something happens that damages the construction or placement of a battery's internals, swelling can result.</p><p>An <strong>internal short circuit</strong> can cause battery swelling, and there's an easy way to trigger one: charging a battery when it's too cold. <strong>Never</strong> charge or store your battery where the temperature is below freezing. In fact, it's a good practice to not even use a device with a lithium battery when it's too cold.</p><p>Yes, you should try to be careful of how you treat your battery. They can be dangerous if used improperly, and a battery swollen with hydrogen gas only needs a spark for everything to become very dangerous.</p><p>This is why we're told to stop using any electronic device with an obviously swollen battery. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-what-makes-a-phone-battery-go-haywire-and-explode">Thermal runaway</a> combined with an explosive gas is bad news.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-do-to-prevent-it-2">What can you do to prevent it?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tZ2LxE7BeEukX8Jjhw4BwT" name="best-usb-c-cables-hero-2022.jpg" alt="USB-C Cables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZ2LxE7BeEukX8Jjhw4BwT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Thankfully, this is fairly easy to mitigate. Something out of your control can happen, naturally, but the biggest issues come from "mistreating" the battery. Notice I don't list old age as a reason for battery swelling; a battery getting old is more susceptible to thermal and charging issues, but age won't cause a lithium battery to emit hydrogen on its own.</p><p>Always charge your battery with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">proper charger and cable</a>. If your new gadget doesn't come with a cable or plug, the papers that were in the box or available online will tell you what those are.</p><p>Try to limit your gadget use when and where it's bitterly cold. Batteries hate heat and cold equally.</p><p><strong>Never</strong> charge your battery where it's below freezing. <strong>Ever</strong>. This is almost a guarantee that you'll create shorts inside the assembly, and it can be a major factor for a swollen battery.</p><p>Of course, if your battery is noticeably swollen, power the device off and let it sit somewhere safe for at least a few hours (because of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/what-is-hysteresis-an-introduction-for-electrical-engineers/" target="_blank">a phenomenon called hysteresis</a>) so the current can stop flowing. Then take it to someone who can open the device and have a look.

They look similar to the ones developed by Samsung that were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">showcased at Google I/O 2025</a> and will undoubtedly be among the most popular smart glasses form factors going forward.</p><p>These smart glasses feature a display in one lens, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses" target="_blank">Meta's</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses"> Ray-Ban Display Glasses</a>. This display uses a holographic waveguide that's visible to the glasses wearer but not to anyone looking from the outside. They have a limited field of view and are primarily used to display notifications, turn-by-turn directions, music playback controls, and other features you might be accustomed to seeing on a smartwatch.</p><p>So far, Google has only shown off glasses that use Gemini voice controls to navigate on the device. That means you need to say "Hey, Google" any time you want to do anything on the glasses. It's a great way to interact while driving or when both of your hands are busy, but it's not ideal for any situation with lots of background noise or when you need to be quiet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ" name="Android-XR-Maps-2" alt="A still from an Android XR example video of how the software will work on smart glasses, showing someone navigating city streets with Google Maps, with a map view holograph showing when to turn." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Cameras mounted on each side can capture photos and record video, giving you a hands-free camera that can be activated in a split second. That can be particularly useful when you're trying to capture something funny your kids or pets are doing, for instance, while a phone takes much longer to pull out of your pocket, launch the camera, and hit record.</p><p>Samsung's glasses will almost certainly be entirely reliant on your phone, similar to a Bluetooth-only smartwatch. The glasses will have some local functionality — capturing photos and video, and maybe locally stored music playback — but they aren't designed to replace your phone. At best, I expect them to be priced slightly lower than Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses, since they won't be able to do as much with voice-only input.</p><p>Essentially, I expect these glasses to operate almost identically to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2</a>, albeit with a display that can visually show you Gemini's feedback and notifications. That visual component could make all the difference to some people, though, as even a camera viewfinder on the display could make it significantly easier to frame your photo or video like you want.</p><p>And I also expect Samsung to launch glasses without this in-lens display, allowing for more affordable options.</p><h2 id="what-it-won-t-be-2">What it won't be</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vvq8PFe5YLqu8t8Hf6AJG6" name="meta-project-orion-ar-glasses-hands-on-ui-02.jpg" alt="A view of the multitasking UI inside Meta Orion AR Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vvq8PFe5YLqu8t8Hf6AJG6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The screenshot you see above is what I saw when demoing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> at Meta Connect 2024. Meta Orion is a pair of smart glasses that feels more like a full "face computer" in a compact form factor. In essence, it's a VR headset without the bulk or immersive mode.</p><p>Samsung's smart glasses will <em>not</em> be a Meta Orion competitor. Not yet, at least. They won't replace your phone, and they likely won't play games or do anything more than you might use your smartwatch for. They're effectively a nice wearable camera with an AI assistant attached that can also make phone calls and display notifications. A way to stop looking at your phone so darn often.</p><p>Warby Parker and Gentle Monster smart glasses made by Samsung almost certainly won't have the ability to track the space around you like a VR headset (or Meta Orion) can, meaning they won't be able to use that in-lens display to overlay virtual imagery on the real world. There's also no evidence showing that Google or Samsung has any sort of input device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">Meta Neural Band</a>. This is a voice-only experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="nDxHrvU7jviWKhmBLDpr6Y" name="Meta-orion-ar-glasses-press-photo-1.jpg" alt="Press photo of a woman wearing the Meta Project Orion AR glasses and using the multitasking software." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nDxHrvU7jviWKhmBLDpr6Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Because of this, they also <strong>won't</strong> be terribly expensive. Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses are <em>only</em> $799 because they cut out a lot of the uber-expensive components that make Meta Orion as capable as it is, and the inclusion of the Meta Neural Band in the box only adds to that cost. If I'm being hopeful, Samsung's display glasses should come in at less than $799.</p><p>If we've learned anything about Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, smart glasses without a display likely won't cost much more than a standard pair of designer-brand frames with lenses, making them a reasonable option for glasses wearers who want more out of their daily specs.</p><p>Despite both of these types of glasses running Android XR, I don't expect to see them running full Android apps. Almost certainly, Android XR on smart glasses will operate like a cut-down version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS</a>, relying on companion apps or smartphone app connectivity to do all the heavy lifting.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CxtFHvkRCkCFErjk2GCwn7" name="magicleap-google-android-xr-smart-glasses-navigation" alt="Magic Leap Android XR smart glasses as seen at FII 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CxtFHvkRCkCFErjk2GCwn7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Magic Leap)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even without full apps running on the display, I can guarantee these will still be an impressive experience that'll augment your everyday life. Whether that's being a tourist and asking Gemini about what you're seeing in a foreign country (see the above image), or asking it how to improve your golf swing, there's a very real reason these will become the next big thing in tech.</p><p>That's going to be especially true if Google and Samsung end up getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">the "remember" feature from demos</a> working on the final product.

Now, the smartphone is generally available for $899 and runs the privacy-focused /e/OS.</p><p>It's the follow-up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-launch">Fairphone 5</a>, which debuted in 2023, and is the fourth Fairphone made in partnership with Murena. You might know the company as the maker of /e/OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wonder-what-life-is-like-without-google-or-apple-you-need-to-try-this-alternative">an Android fork that provides a "deGoogled" experience</a> for users. The operating system retains only what is needed, cutting out data collection at the system level. It also adds custom, tracker-free Mail and Calendar apps, plus the Murena Workspace for business and cloud needs.</p><p>The private software experience from Murena combines with Fairphone's repairable electronics design in an effort to offer users "an ethical smartphone," according to the news release. Fairphone 6 is made to be repairable, packing a modular design with parts that can be replaced with a single screwdriver. The repairable smartphone comes with five years of warranty, too.</p><p>On the hardware side, you get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip</a> and a 4,415mAh battery. Despite offering a larger capacity, the Fairphone 6 battery is smaller than the one used in the Fairphone 5, and costs less than $50 to replace. There's a primary 50MP main camera paired with a 13MP ultrawide lens for all your photography needs.</p><p>The Fairphone 6 comes with 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage as standard, but there's a microSD card slot for future expansion. The display panel is a 6.31-inch OLED covered with Gorilla Glass 7i.</p><h2 id="why-you-might-want-to-buy-a-fairphone-6-2">Why you might want to buy a Fairphone 6</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rLdnBXvAf3VCzncqtrQGs8" name="Murena-Fairphone-Gen-6-02" alt="Fairphone (Gen 6)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rLdnBXvAf3VCzncqtrQGs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fairphone)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the $899 price tag for the Fairphone 6 is hefty, especially when you consider that you're paying flagship rates for a phone with midrange specs. The value proposition is much more than what you get on paper, though. The Fairphone 6's privacy-first nature and repairability, which includes 12 easily-repairable parts, are what makes it an attractive option — even for the price.</p><p>Building a private, sustainable, and repairable Android smartphone isn't cheap, so you'll be paying a premium for that if you choose to buy the Fairphone 6. However, there are some that will gladly pay more for a repairable phone without unnecessary Google apps or services.</p> ]]></dc:content>
