Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV" name="lloyd-should-you-buy_720" caption="" alt="Lloyd going shopping!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">So many tech products!

If this is something you might want or need, it's a great deal.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bypHukkTkraENuHJsvDmUN" name="Roku-sports-experience.jpg" alt="Roku sports experience" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bypHukkTkraENuHJsvDmUN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roku)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are many ways to stream media from the internet to your eyes, but most of them are extremely expensive, not so with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/roku-streaming-stick-4k-vs-chromecast-google">streaming sticks</a>. These tiny gadgets plug into the HDMI port on a television and connect through Wi-Fi to stream all sorts of live TV, sports, and movies. Here's what's great about the Roku.</p><p><strong>It's cheap</strong>. You're going to waste $30 this week on something. If you give up a couple of lattes or cook at home one extra evening, you can buy this instead.</p><p><strong>It's easy</strong>. Roku's interface seems cluttered at first, I'm not going to lie. But if you take just a minute and zip through it, everything is categorized nicely, and there is no Google or Amazon changing everything on your home screen to infuriate you.</p><p><strong>It works with everything</strong>. It simply sends an audio and video signal through HDMI. That means it works on every TV made in the last 20 years, and even a computer monitor. As long as you can get an unfettered Wi-Fi connection (more on that further down the page), it just works.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1365px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CHexkzQmP9dXHKZjxSTDkH" name="tp-link-archer-wi-fi-7-announcement.jpg" alt="TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 router announcement" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHexkzQmP9dXHKZjxSTDkH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1365" height="768" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TP-Link)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing is perfect, and there are some things to think about before you fork over your money. Everything works that way.</p><p><strong>It's not very powerful</strong>. I have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-shield-tv-pro-still-worth-buying">Nvidia Shield Pro</a> and an old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-tv-cube-2019-vs-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k">Amazon Fire TV</a>. One is really fast when scrolling through menus or getting a stream to start, while the other is ass. This Roku is right in the middle. It will show you what you want to see, but it might take an extra few seconds to get there.</p><p><strong>It's Wi-Fi only</strong>. We all have that spot in our home where the Wi-Fi isn't as fast as it is everywhere else. I happen to have a television in one of those spots, and because my Shield Pro can use Ethernet, it works fast. If I were forced to use Wi-Fi, I'd see some buffering, or the picture would suffer.</p><p><strong>It needs "open" Wi-Fi. </strong>No, not the public and unsafe kind of Wi-Fi, but a connection without a captive portal. Ever use Wi-Fi on a plane or in a hotel and have to start on a specific page or enter some sort of code? This isn;t going to work there. That's kinda bad because this gadget is the perfect price and size to carry with you on a business trip or vacation. There are workarounds, or you could tether from your phone's connection, though.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>So, should you buy the Roku Streaming Stick 4K?</p><p>If you want a cheap and easy way to stream videos and still get great video quality, the Roku is 4K (of course, it's in the name) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-hdr10-and-why-does-it-make-galaxy-s10-screen-better">HDR10</a>. It will look as good as the screen it's attached to.</p><p>If you want Google or Amazon in the picture, so you can use apps or decent voice commands, pass on this one.</p><p>Finally, if you're looking for something to bring along on a business trip, check out the different ways to use a Roku with Hotel Wi-Fi and decide if you can live with them. if so, $30 gets you some entertainment instead of paying for PPV hotel movies.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6ddd924d-8741-4694-997c-455b80fa9255" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="For just 30 bucks during Walmart's holiday sale, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K gives you instant access to all of your favorite streaming services with free live TV channels, Dolby Vision, and HDR10+ support.

Google officially added Qi2 support with built-in magnets to the Pixel 10 series via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>, and Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-accessories-leak">rumored to do the same</a> on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 series</a>.</p><p>When it's time to upgrade your phone, it'll also be a good idea to upgrade your wireless charger. There are a few first-party options from Google, but for the most part, Android users are looking to third-party accessory makers to fill the gap. Your next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2-supported wireless charger</a> might come from an unlikely brand: Ikea.</p><p>That's right — the Swedish home goods and furniture store that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ikea-launches-affordable-smart-sensors">also dabbles in smart home tech</a> now has a new lineup of official Qi2 chargers. The Ikea Västmärke is a donut-shaped Qi2 wireless charger with a few tricks up its sleeve. You shouldn't write it off as a gimmick, because it might be the best Qi2 charger for Android users on the market, and it's certainly the best value.</p><h2 id="wait-ikea-is-making-an-affordable-qi2-charger-2">Wait, Ikea is making an affordable Qi2 charger?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2ajRJShdUMPZ4kAmjUmFPG" name="Ikea-Qi2-Charger-3" alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ajRJShdUMPZ4kAmjUmFPG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ikea)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ikea's Västmärke wireless charger is available for just $10 in select stores, with delivery available as well. From a design standpoint, it's thicker than most other Qi2 wireless chargers. The product has a hybrid design, functioning as a portable wireless charging solution or a flat charging base for use on a desk or nightstand.</p><p>The donut shape is certainly striking, but it fits right in with Ikea's modern design language. It doesn't look like a tech product in the best way, complete with a "happy red color." There are no bland white, gray, or black color options that we're all too used to seeing in the tech space. It's available only in this intriguing circular shape and only in "happy" red.</p><p>The charging pad has a built-in cable that spans 47 inches, or just under four feet. It's a solid charging length that'll work for stationary desk setups but won't be too cumbersome on the go. The charging cable is made out of silicone. There's no power adapter in the box — you can use a 20W USB-C power adapter you already own or add one on from Ikea for an extra $4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VwfpWfxkEhUQvbfCC5BSWF" name="Ikea-Qi2-Charger-5" alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VwfpWfxkEhUQvbfCC5BSWF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ikea)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's fully certified by the Wireless Power Consortium, supporting both the Qi2 Baseline Power Profile and Magnetic Power Profile. This means it'll work with older Qi devices without magnets, and it'll also support snap connection with newer Qi2 ones. Notably, Ikea's Västmärke supports Power Deliver 3.0 and Quick Charge 2.0.</p><p>In other words, the Ikea Västmärke is more than just a gimmick — it provides everything you might need from a Qi2 charger.</p><h2 id="ikea-s-charger-solves-a-few-problems-with-qi2-cables-2">Ikea's charger solves a few problems with Qi2 cables</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bw2pTSLeJPGyApApbg2tVF" name="Ikea-Qi2-Charger-2" alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bw2pTSLeJPGyApApbg2tVF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ikea)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wireless charging is somewhat controversial among tech enthusiasts due to a few of its downsides. It's less efficient, slower, and hotter than charging over a cable. However, I find it hard to build out a wireless charging ecosystem for a different reason. Wireless chargers are only useful if they're where you need them, and most of the Qi2 chargers on the market would look sorely out of place in a living room.</p><p>Ikea's Västmärke addresses the issue of wireless chargers blending in, and it does it while making a fashion statement. The bright red color and silicone exterior look great, but there's more to it than that. The Västmärke design serves a functional purpose, too. The 47-inch cable can be coiled and stashed within the donut-shaped charger for cleaner storage and peak portability.</p><p>What's more, the donut's silicone surface actually pops outward to reveal a phone grip. It's like having a built-in PopSocket in your wireless charger. That's helpful because any Qi2 wireless charger adds bulk to your phone, and Ikea's Västmärke lets you keep using it while charging.</p><h2 id="i-m-buying-this-donut-shaped-ikea-charger-immediately-2">I'm buying this donut-shaped Ikea charger immediately</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="i8ByCNqnPZwRh8FooLnKwF" name="Ikea-Qi2-Charger-1" alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i8ByCNqnPZwRh8FooLnKwF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ikea)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If it wasn't for the price, I probably wouldn't have given the Ikea Västmärke another look. But the official Google Pixelsnap Charger is $40 and is relatively uninteresting, save for the fact that it can charge <em>only</em> the Pixel 10 Pro XL at 25W speeds. Instead, I can get four Ikea Västmärke chargers for the same price to cover my home with wireless charging pads.</p><p>With the cable stashed away, this Qi2 wireless-charging "donut" looks more like a modern art piece than a charger. For only $10 each, this clever, quirky wireless charger is one I think almost every Android user should consider adding to their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">magnetic charging ecosystem</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="4a1b6596-0f26-4ab8-ba00-ba67dd3e5411">            <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/vaestmaerke-wireless-charger-30618425/" data-model-name="Västmärke" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SufAQ7UvCFRcCSENQBVmaE.jpg' alt="The Ikea VÄSTMÄRKE donut wireless Qi2 charger."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Ikea</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Västmärke</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Standing out</strong></em></p><p>In a crowded wireless charger market littered with similar options, Ikea's Västmärke stands out with Qi2 support, a fun and colorful design, and a built-in phone grip.

I'm positive there are things I shouldn't do, so I'm asking you.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p><p>Hiya Anon! And yes, at first this one was a pass for me, and I thought the question was a bit too simple. Then I got to thinking — I'm sure every one of us cleans their phone a different way, and I'll bet a lot of us do it the wrong way!</p><p>So, all in all, thanks for asking. The simple questions are often the most important.</p><p>I'm going to explain how I clean phones and tablets, but most importantly, I'm going to talk about what not to do. If it gets things clean without any sort of damage or wear, then it's the right way.</p><p>Every day I wipe the screen. I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Touchscreen-Microfiber-Cleaning-Solution-Fingerprint-Proof/dp/B0C8CKLSSF/" target="_blank">one of these little gadgets</a> (I love these things) for both the inside screen and front display of my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr</a>. I have no idea what the fluid inside them is, but it works and is supposed to be guaranteed not to harm anything.</p><p>Speaking of fluids, <em><strong>never, ever</strong></em> use window cleaner or ammonia to clean your phone's screen. Both leave residue when they dry, and if even a single drop seeps inside your phone, it can be ruined. If you have a really bad spot (TMI: I once sneezed on my phone screen. Yuck!), use distilled water (not tap water or "drinking" water, distilled only!). Put a drop on your cleaning cloth and sort of scrub the mess away.</p><p>To be extra safe, when you're done (or if you sneezed on it), use a second cloth and some 90%+ Isopropyl alcohol all over the front, back, and sides. This kills germs and dries mostly streak-free.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="prMWfT5phMsX9raa2wnYuU" name="Google-Pixel-10-series-Pixelsnap-cases-3" alt="Pixel 10 and 10 Pro cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/prMWfT5phMsX9raa2wnYuU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3864" height="2174" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it needs it (like every month or so), everything gets a proper cleaning. I shut the phone off and remove any case or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-favorite-magsafe-phone-grips-ranked">doohickies</a> that may be attached. The case goes into the bathroom sink, and I wash it with warm, soapy water, then give it an alcohol rub. Set it aside and let it dry.</p><p>Next, I give the screen(s) a good cleaning as I described above. While I'm at it, I pay special attention to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">camera lenses</a> to make sure they don't have smudgy fingerprints or worse.</p><p>Then I want to clean the speaker and microphone holes, as well as the charging port. You can do this in several ways: use a soft-bristled <em><strong>dry</strong></em> toothbrush to go over them, use a wooden toothpick to flick out all the dirt and crusty stuff, or, what I think is best, use a chunk of BlueTak or Silly Putty. Just press it gently in place, count to five, then peel it — and the dirt — away.</p><p>Along the edge of the screen, I run a wooden toothpick along the tiny gap and weasel out any dirt that got in there next. When all this is done, I give the screen another wipe or two, then disinfect with some alcohol. Once the case is bone dry, I put it back on.</p><p>Done!</p><p>Notice I didn't mention things like ultrasonic jewelry cleaners or gadgets like the ones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phonesoap-pro-review">PhoneSoap</a> makes. I would never use an ultrasonic cleaner on a phone because that is a sure way to force liquid inside. Yeah, the liquid may be safe and dry without any residue, but I'd rather play it safe.</p><p>As for PhoneSoap and similar products, they should be safe to use for disinfection. I just like the cheap version of using alcohol. You need to wipe and clean your phone anyway, so it only takes a minute longer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="c3UEW7KfHH9rntjjC4KW9j" name="mud.jpg" alt="Mud" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c3UEW7KfHH9rntjjC4KW9j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lionsgate )</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, you <em><strong>can</strong></em> get things so dirty that you need to let someone who can open the phone take a look and clean it up. You probably shouldn't take your phone with you when you're doing something like mudbogging or riding in an airboat, but if you did and it got extra muddy or was dunked in muddy water, stop.</p><p>Turn your phone off right away, then take it to a repair shop. If you're the type that tears things apart yourself, take everything apart and hose it down thoroughly with <strong>CRC Quick Dry electronic cleaner</strong>; circuit boards, ribbon connectors, all of it. Give it an hour to dry completely, then try to put it back together. Good luck.</p><h2 id="jerry-s-big-list-of-things-to-never-do-2">Jerry's big list of things to never do</h2><ul><li><strong>Use ammonia or window cleaner on your phone screen.</strong></li><li><strong>Use bleach to clean or disinfect your phone.</strong></li><li><strong>Use compressed air to try to blow out the tiny holes and crevices.</strong></li><li><strong>Dunk your phone in any liquid, including water, to try to clean it.</strong></li><li><strong>Stick it in the dishwasher.</strong></li></ul><p>Any or all of these is a quick way to needing a new phone.

Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, highlighted the app today in the Meta Instagram channel, stating that the company is "testing Instagram for TV — a new way to watch Reels on your TV." As you'd expect from this message, the app's TV presence focuses strongly on the platform's short-form content: Reels.</p><p>Amazon says the app is "organized into channels tuned to your interests." A few channels include sports, music videos, and trending topics. The app's main view showcases these Reels horizontally, including "For You" and "Popular with friends."</p><p>As it rolls out today, users will need to sign into their Instagram accounts on their Fire TVs.

In short, the platform gave users in the U.S. the keys to control their Reels feed by telling the AI what they want to see and what they don't. Head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, said that he envisioned a world where there was "transparency and control" with what users see on Instagram, and tuning the algorithm is a part of that.</p><p>Through this, users will see what the AI thinks they enjoy, with options to delete some supposed interests and add better ones.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It often takes a while to truly understand the long-term health risks associated with something new. When social media became prevalent on smartphones and in schools, we didn't know how it would affect young people. Now, it's clear that social media use does negatively affect kids, with an advisory from the U.S. Surgeon General stating that "types of use and content children and adolescents are exposed to pose mental health concerns."</p><p>Although experts and regulators are beginning to acknowledge that social media use at a young age poses risks, no one can agree on what to do about it. Some countries, like Australia, are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/is-youtube-bad-for-your-kids">enacting outright social media bans</a>. In the U.S., individual states and school districts are banning cell phones in schools while legislators mull what to do at the national level.</p><p>Bans might sound like an easy solution to a complicated problem, but teenagers are more optimistic about the future of technology and how it can be used for good, according to a Google-commissioned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/families/future-report-teen-perspectives-europe-2025/" target="_blank">study</a>. A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/families/build-the-internet-young-people-are-asking-for-instead-of-simply-banning-them-from-it/" target="_blank">analysis</a> by Jeffrey DeMarco, a senior technical advisor for Save The Children, sends a clear message: "the fix is not a blanket prohibition."</p><h2 id="what-the-research-study-found-2">What the research study found</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8" name="youtube-android-central" alt="Android Central's YouTube homepage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's study asked over 7,000 teenagers from across Europe what they want to get out of technology, and what they see as its future. Although the study was commissioned by Google, it was conducted separately by youth consultancy group <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://livity.co.uk" target="_blank">Livity</a>. It found that most teenagers already use social media and technology for learning. In the case of AI, students think they should be learning more about using it responsibly.</p><p>Australia's social media ban now covers YouTube, posing a problem for teens who have grown up using the platform for learning. The research study found that 74% of polled European teenagers have watched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube">YouTube</a> videos to learn something new for school. On a broader scale, nearly 84% of respondents said they watch educational or how-to videos at least a few times per week, and over a third say they watch these types of videos daily.</p><p>The study paints a picture of social media being a genuine learning tool for teenagers, and outright bans remove that element completely. "The point is not that feeds are not without their pitfalls and challenges, but that for the majority of teens, feeds are where they learn," writes DeMarco, the forensic psychologist who leads the Safer Digital Childhood program for Save The Children. "They are their classrooms, and they are asking for smarter, safer ones."</p><h2 id="pretending-social-media-and-ai-don-t-exist-won-t-help-anyone-2">Pretending social media and AI don't exist won't help anyone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WgvMUEtiWjgH7Rio2m2Kub" name="Gemini-3-1" alt="Using the new Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro models in the Gemini app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WgvMUEtiWjgH7Rio2m2Kub.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As my colleague <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/is-youtube-bad-for-your-kids">Jerry Hildenbrand rightly points out</a>, kids are smarter than all of us. They'll thwart outright social media bans or restrictive measures without thoughtful guidance. I know because I was one of those kids not too long ago, bypassing my school network's internet blocklist with VPNs on a school-issued iPad (sorry, teachers). Young people will always find a workaround because they've grown up with technology, while the rest of us are forced to learn it.</p><p>If social media is banned and AI use is neglected in schools, kids risk being left behind. The research study revealed that 96% of older European teens used AI in the past year, and 40% of teenagers use it daily or almost daily. Young people are recognizing AI's value as a learning tool while also recognizing its risks. They'd rather see "clear, age-appropriate guardrails" instead of outright bans.</p><p>"That means spelling out what is OK, what is not, how to cite, how to verify," writes DeMarco. "That is what the teens are implicitly asking for, and the report’s recommendations explicitly call for through curriculum-level AI and media literacy, age-appropriate experiences and harmonized standards that preserve access to information while protecting younger users."</p><p>It's worth acknowledging that teens may be better at understanding the risks of AI and misinformation than adults. This particular study revealed that 55% of teens consider whether content is trustworthy, and 46% look for multiple sources for verification. Anecdotally, I've had to explain to my parents what "parody" accounts are on X and the realism of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-rolling-out-likeness-detection-for-creators">deepfakes</a>, but the younger people in my life are already tuned into the situation.</p><p>Another factor to consider is whether limiting social media and AI use among adolescents could hold them back in the future. In a November 2025 commentary by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/2025/ec-202514-are-young-college-graduates-losing-their-edge-in-the-job-market" target="_blank">Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland</a>, economic experts acknowledged "some of the long-standing job market advantages offered by having a college degree may be eroding." As artificial intelligence continues to impact the job market, recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data reveals that young college graduates are having a harder time finding jobs than those with only a high school degree.</p><p>The commentary notes that there are "concerns about AI automation of entry-level positions traditionally filled by college graduates," underscoring the importance of AI education. Young people need to learn to harness AI as part of their secondary education to make thoughtful decisions about college and their careers.</p><h2 id="ban-predatory-practices-not-the-apps-themselves-2">Ban predatory practices, not the apps themselves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="oW6Zh4i4bgicP2niY9pxqa" name="Instagram-hero-AC-2024.jpg" alt="Instagram logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oW6Zh4i4bgicP2niY9pxqa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether we're discussing social media use or AI use in schools, DeMarco's analysis of the research study argues "the real work is making those environments safer by default and raising the floor of digital literacy."</p><p>This study shows that young people are optimistic about technology, from social media to AI.

This becomes especially true <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/oneplus-13-512gb-unlocked-midnight-ocean/CZYJWF7XQQ"><strong>when you slap on a $200 discount at Best Buy</strong></a>, knocking the price of the unlocked flagship down to $799.99 (or $699.99 when you activate through AT&T or Verizon).</p><p>For a little perspective, this is the <em>same low price</em> that we saw on the OnePlus 13 during Best Buy's Black Friday sale.

Grab the 512GB version of the phone from Best Buy and you'll score a straight $200 discount, or $300 if you activate through Verizon or AT&T.</p><p>If you want to save a little more, you can also buy the unlocked phone for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP8KZLQ3"><strong>$749.99 at Amazon</strong></a>, but you'll be stuck with 256GB of onboard storage. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/oneplus-13-512gb-unlocked-midnight-ocean/CZYJWF7XQQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="fbe148d4-4727-417e-a542-845d50f134ce" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Straight out of the box, the first thing you'll notice is the OnePlus 13's 6.8-inch OLED QHD+ display with a 120Hz refresh rate. It's truly stunning to behold, and it helps that the OnePlus 13 is also the first phone to receive a DisplayMate A++ certification, meaning it'll work for folks with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>. </p><p>It's also one of the first devices to receive an IP69 water-and-dust resistance rating, which is why we harp on the dishwasher thing. It's just a huge relief to have a phone that you can accidentally drop into a puddle without causing any major issues. </p><p>The greatness of the OnePlus 13 doesn't just come from its looks, however. Under the hood you get the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, easily one of the fastest processors on the market, plus Oxygen OS 15 and 12GB of RAM. Furthermore, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review">the phone's camera tech</a> easily holds its own against the best devices from Samsung and Google, and the upgraded AI features are actually useful when taking pics or video. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5029px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="NmES7DAjnQbcw5eobfrGYF" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13 testing one year later" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmES7DAjnQbcw5eobfrGYF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5029" height="2833" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what's the catch? Well, no device is perfect, and it's true that the OnePlus 13 lags behind the competition when it comes to offline AI features. The phone also lacks Qi2 charging support, which was a welcome addition to both Samsung and Google's latest devices. </p><p>The six years of software support also falls (slightly) behind Samsung and Google's seven-year update promise. You'll still get security upgrades beyond that, but this could be a problem if you want to receive all the latest features beyond that timeline. If you're not in a rush and don't mind paying more, you also might want to wait until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> finally hits store shelves in late December/early January.</p><p>All things said and done, you have to get pretty nitpicky to find faults in the OnePlus 13. It really comes down to the experience you want. Are you super into AI features? Are you too accustomed to the Samsung or Pixel UI? Or do you simply want the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone of 2025</a> at an incredible Black Friday price? I'll leave it to you to decide. </p><h2 id="holiday-shopping-2025-quick-links-7">Holiday shopping 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The same source <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-and-notebooklm-could-work-even-closer-together-in-a-future-update">spotted this change in November</a>.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING 🚨: Google is rolling out a NotebookLM integration for Gemini, where users will be able to attach notebooks as a context to their conversations.

Gemini is more of a creative generalist, offering broader reasoning but not focusing as much on your specific files.</p><h2 id="merging-two-ai-strengths-2">Merging two AI strengths</h2><p>Both tools are powerful, but keeping them separate made it hard to use Gemini’s advanced logic with your NotebookLM sources without extra steps. That is now apparently changing.</p><p>The update is surprisingly seamless. When attaching files to a prompt, some users are now seeing a NotebookLM option alongside the usual upload buttons. This shortcut lets you bring whole NotebookLM notebooks into a Gemini chat and ask questions based on the sources you have collected.</p><p>Rather than summarizing the open web or guessing what you mean, Gemini can now respond based on your PDFs, Google Docs, slides, and links stored in NotebookLM. This is important because NotebookLM was designed to help people make sense of large, messy sets of information while staying accurate.</p><p>Google hasn’t made a major announcement yet, and availability seems limited. Early reports suggest the feature is web-only for now and isn’t visible to everyone, even among paid Gemini users. This suggests Google is rolling it out gradually. Hopefully, it will be available on Gemini’s mobile version soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the executive, OnePlus is creating a new lineup that focuses on strong performance and long battery life.</p><p>The Turbo series will likely be just below <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus’ top flagship phones</a>, but should still offer strong features. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Q44xMozHX" target="_blank">Early leaks</a> suggest these phones will use high-end chipsets, possibly including Snapdragon 8-series SoCs.</p><p>This strategy is similar to what OnePlus has done before with performance-focused phones.

While OnePlus hasn’t confirmed exact specs yet, leaks hint at high-refresh-rate panels with resolutions around 1.5K.</p><p>The launch timing for the Turbo series is notable. Competition among performance-focused Android phones has increased, with many brands now promoting gaming phones or devices with long battery life.</p><p>Recently, OnePlus has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-latest-tech-promises-to-enhance-the-android-gaming-experience">gained momentum with its new flagship phones</a> and a closer connection to younger, performance-focused customers.

Users can highlight any part of a book they're reading to get started with "Ask this book."</p><p>The elements the AI can respond to seem relatively wide-arching. The blog post states the AI can deliver details about the story's plot, character relationships, and thematic elements "without disrupting your reading flow."</p><p>Amazon adds that its generative AI software can answer questions about highlighted portions in a "spoiler-free" manner. It was stated that the AI responds quickly. When highlighting a section of a book, users will notice an "Ask" button in the hovering menu. From there, users can enter their query before being placed in a formal chat with the AI.</p><p>The post suggests using the pre-made queries if you're looking to get going even faster, as well as your personally crafted question. "Ask this book" is rolling out for iOS devices in the Kindle app for U.S. users; however, Android readers will have to wait until 2026. Joining this is "Recaps," a feature that lets Kindle and Kindle app users on iOS gain a refresher about their favorite series after the downtime between book releases.</p><h2 id="not-everyone-s-excited-to-dive-in-2">Not everyone's excited to dive in</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1073px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.92%;"><img id="DEKaWdYE9grGfCjLbvfr2Y" name="amazon-kindle-app-ask-this-book" alt="The Amazon Kindle app launches "Ask this book," a feature that lets users interact with its AI about story plots, character relationships, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DEKaWdYE9grGfCjLbvfr2Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1073" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon's "Ask this book" has been making its rounds, and after the feature was highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lunch.publishersmarketplace.com/2025/12/kindles-new-ask-this-book-uses-generative-ai-to-create-an-in-book-chatbot-without-permission-or-rights/">Publisher Lunch</a>, there's uncertainty behind its effects on rightsholders (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://writerbeware.blog/2025/12/12/kindles-new-gen-ai-powered-ask-this-book-feature-raises-rights-concerns/">Writer Beware</a>).

It's great for watching movies or playing games, and is large enough so that you don't feel cramped when using split-windowed apps or working with a bunch of different apps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VQ48K2fJDVFxSdvSa7U5uN" name="scrcpyforandroid-tab-s10-ultra-galaxy-chromebook-plus" alt="ScrcpyForAndroid running on Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra connected to Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQ48K2fJDVFxSdvSa7U5uN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is one potential caveat with the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, and it has to do with the display. Unlike many of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/walmart-chromebook-deals-holidays-2025">best Chromebook options</a> out there, Samsung opted against offering a convertible design. As such, you'll need to look elsewhere if that's a key requirement for picking up a new Chromebook.</p><p>Even still, if the convertible design is not an absolute necessity, and you have the budget, then this is probably the Chromebook for you. And while it might not have the latest and greatest processor, there's still plenty of juice under the hood to handle much of what you can even think about throwing at it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="45YJPs2ZJszBfJawANLtHn" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-13.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus keyboard close-up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/45YJPs2ZJszBfJawANLtHn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung and Google worked closely on the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, as it was the first to feature a dedicated "Insert Key." This works in almost every app or browser window on your Chromebook. It also gives you quick access to basic things like an emoji picker, and of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>.</p><p>Speaking of which, if you do happen to snag the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, not only are you saving $150, but Google includes 12 months of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/is-google-one-ai-premium-the-only-mobile-ai-suite-worth-paying-for">Google One AI Premium</a>. With this, you get 2TB of storage, access to the Gemini Advanced model, along with being able to make use of Gemini in your various Google apps.</p><p>With that in mind, you might want to move fairly quickly on this deal, as Christmas will be here before you know it. And as such, there's a pretty good chance you'll end up seeing the Galaxy Chromebook Plus return to its original retail price.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In a press release, Motorola states that its latest G Power was built with speed in mind to keep up with your wild digital (and daily) life. Set for a January 8 market debut with a $299 price, the Moto G Power 2026 features a flat 6.8-inch FHD Plus display. Motorola builds on this with 120Hz refresh rate support and up to 1,000nits of peak brightness.</p><p>Another area Motorola sought to expand upon was the phone's durability. Specifications list 14 MIL-STD-810H resilience, capable of withstanding "drops, temperature extremes, and humidity." For the screen, Motorola leveraged Corning Gorilla Glass 7i, as well as an IP68 and IP69 rating for water protection.</p><p>Bringing the speed and reliability that Motorola claims the G Power is capable of is MediaTek's Dimensity 6300 SoC. It's worth mentioning that this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">is the same chip</a> that empowered the G Power 2025 earlier this year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4127px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Cw5q9qAyrM66rAU8Cxk3iE" name="moto-g-power-2026-cashmere-color" alt="Motorola G Power 2026 in a Cashmere color beside an iced coffee on a cream-colored table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cw5q9qAyrM66rAU8Cxk3iE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4127" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Flip the G Power over to find its dual-camera array inside a square housing. The design is pretty similar to what Motorola brought with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">G Power 2025 edition</a>. Leading the duo is the main shooter: a 50MP lens with Quad Pixel Technology and OIS (optical image stabilization). In tandem, Moto states the device is capable of capturing your memories in greater detail. Flanking the 50MP is an 8MP ultrawide, macro vision lens combo.</p><p>The display houses the 32MP selfie camera. Motorola's photography-focused AI continues with Auto Night Vision, Auto Smile Capture, and Shot Optimization.</p><p>The AI features roll on with Google's involvement through Gemini and Circle to Search. Consumers will grab Android 16 with the Moto G Power 2026, alongside "Smart Connect." Motorola states Smart Connect lets users quickly transfer files and sync experiences. The company itself adds Moto Secure, Unplugged, Family Space, ThinkShield, and Hello UX.</p><h2 id="raise-a-brow-at-this-budget-phone-2">Raise a brow at this budget phone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4127px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="o3grd5DRyFtatins6BKDmM" name="moto-g-power-2026-cashmere-evening-blue-options" alt="The Motorola G Power 2026 in its Cashmere and Evening Blue color options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o3grd5DRyFtatins6BKDmM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4127" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Internal hardware specifications include a 5,200mAh battery that Motorola claims can sustain users for roughly two days. Battery Care helps users keep tabs on its health, as well as providing tracking support for optimized performance. Motorola combined this battery with 30W charging to deliver "hours of use" in a few minutes. The phone's 8GB of RAM helps with switching tabs and the demands of other key uses. The company highlights its AI-powered RAM Boost for up to 16GB of virtual RAM for "speed and responsiveness."</p><p>As previously stated, the Moto G Power 2026 will be available on January 8 for $299. The device is featured in two colors: PANTONE Pure Cashmere and PANTONE Evening Blue. Consumers can find the device on Best Buy, Amazon, and motorola.com when the time comes. Those in Canada can expect the phone to launch with a $449 price tag.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google is trying out a small but important update to how we begin our online searches. There’s now a new plus (+) button in the Search bar that does more than just handle keywords and nudges you into using generative AI.</p><p>If you’ve ever wanted Google to look at your document or photo and explain what’s inside, this update moves things closer to that. When you click the plus sign, a dropdown menu appears with two options: "Upload image" and "Upload file” (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/15/google-search-plus-menu/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>After you choose one of these options, you go straight into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">AI Mode</a>. Here, Google’s generative models review your upload and give you summaries, explanations, or answers based on what’s in the file.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-direct-shortcut-to-ai-mode-2">It’s a direct shortcut to AI Mode</h2><p>This feature isn’t completely new. Google already allows file uploads in AI Mode. The main change is that it’s now easier to find. Google obviously wants people to see that Search is more than just typing questions.</p><p>For a long time, Google Search has focused on keywords. You type a question, Google searches the web, and you get links. That approach is still there, but now there’s more to it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1093px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.16%;"><img id="BJ9pSK9MZga2pebfRxubzF" name="AI-Mode-plus-button" alt="AI Mode in search showing a plus button for uploading images and files" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BJ9pSK9MZga2pebfRxubzF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1093" height="592" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the past year, Google has been reshaping Search to feel more like a conversation than a list of links.

This is probably on purpose. Desktop users often upload PDFs, documents, or screenshots, so it’s a safer way for Google to see how people use this feature.</p><p>Here’s hoping this feature also comes to mobile next, where searching with your camera or images already feels normal.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is wrapped in the company's Search Labs experimental environment. The Labs description for the feature reads, "make your Discover feed truly yours by saying what you want to see." It seems Google is fueling it with a heavy dose of AI to not only adhere to the user's request, but to hunt down that specific content.</p><p>Once you get down to it, "Tailor your Feed" is pretty receptive about what the user wants to see—and what it doesn't want to see, too.</p><p>There's a basic text box for the user to type their content preferences for the Google app's Discover feed. Once done, the fine print says "you'll be able to review before making changes." However, Google's early test shows that it's planning to offer a few suggestions, such as "stop showing me negative news." There were other suggestions listed, like "keep me updated on country music," which alludes to the AI briefly glancing over what's currently offered in your feed.</p><p>Once your prompt is in, "Tailor your feed" opens a chat thread with the AI. It will respond with the type of content you can "expect to see." Additionally, you can pile on more to really nail your ideal Discover feed. The post by 9to5 adds that you can even set the following content preferences: publishers, creators, formats, or "vibes."</p><h2 id="discover-more-2">Discover more</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="sSP3cwuaWXjr8fzGpCrgvU" name="google-app-search-labs-tailor-your-feed-description" alt="Google's "Tailor your feed" is a new Search Labs test that leans on the user's prompt to display content they want in the app's Discover feed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sSP3cwuaWXjr8fzGpCrgvU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:263px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:228.14%;"><img id="k9bX36LXYSKDqRTc5fh3vU" name="google-app-search-labs-tailor-your-feed-ai-chat" alt="Google's "Tailor your feed" test will let users enter their own prompt, alongside a few suggestions for how their should tailor their Discover feed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9bX36LXYSKDqRTc5fh3vU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="263" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>While Google is slowly kicking off this experiment for users in the U.S., there was another test for the Discover feed earlier this year.</p><p>Google experimented with turning users' Discover feeds into a short podcast this year with its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-you-to-listen-to-your-discover-feed-with-daily-listen-experiment">Daily Listen</a>" test.

It's not hard to figure out why. The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro were ridiculed by fans and haters alike for their appearance, which channel the AirPods Pro style in a very similar way. This model added stems for the first time and snap-attaching ear tips for the first time, similar to AirPods.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">Samsung executives were reportedly furious</a> that the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro looked like a knockoff of the AirPods Pro. As a result, I'm not surprised at all that the company is set to make sweeping changes with the upcoming Galaxy Buds 4 Pro. I just didn't expect them to be this radical.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-4-leak-shows-a-slight-design-reboot">revealed in a One UI 8.5 animations leak</a>, the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are expected to have a revamped design with flatter stems, a different insertion angle, and a new mesh grill on the outside (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-4-look-3621013/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). The triangular stems and their LED strips seem to be completely gone.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="p5TsuT5mdzSzPrjZdU4EwZ" name="galaxy-buds-4-pro-pics-2.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Buds 4 Pro design renders." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p5TsuT5mdzSzPrjZdU4EwZ.webp" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="960" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="qhWy98ugn8kCWyRZjKCGwZ" name="galaxy-buds-4-pro-pics-1.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Buds 4 Pro design renders." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qhWy98ugn8kCWyRZjKCGwZ.webp" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="960" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Looking at the leaked Galaxy Buds 4 Pro renders, I'm prematurely mourning the loss of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. I would've liked Samsung to improve the reliability of swipe gestures and pinch controls, which were too easy to accidentally trigger. I would've also welcomed sturdier ear tips and a refined connection system, as the current model's tips tend to tear when switched out often.</p><p>But a complete design overhaul? That feels excessive.</p><p>Considering the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro were arguably my favorite earbuds until Bose released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-gen-2-earbuds-review">QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2</a> earbuds a few months ago, I'm worried the design changes could be for the worse. When it comes to headphone and earbud design, less is more. If it isn't broke, don't try to fix it.</p><p>It's a philosophy I'm all too familiar with, because Apple's revamped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3</a> design left me on the outside looking in. Although I've used AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro 2 in the past, I simply don't find the newer model comfortable. That's the risk a company takes when it significantly changes the design of an audio product. What's frightening is that the rumored Galaxy Buds 4 Pro design changes look to be far greater than what Apple did with the AirPods Pro 3.</p><h2 id="samsung-might-revamp-the-galaxy-buds-4-pro-case-for-the-worse-2">Samsung might revamp the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro case for the worse </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vsR6tw6wU9v9iuTz5xXDCR" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-unboxing.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vsR6tw6wU9v9iuTz5xXDCR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung isn't stopping with just the earbuds — it's also rumored to be changing the case design as well. Instead of a tall charging case that the earbuds slide into vertically, the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are expected to use a flat, jewelry-style charging case. I'm not a fan of this earbud case style, as they're typically larger and harder to pocket than the alternative. I feel like the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro replacement could be a step backward.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:975px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.10%;"><img id="aqFZBgCQqgSHXKd5awUWw8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Buds-4-Pro-new-design" alt="new design and stem appearance of the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aqFZBgCQqgSHXKd5awUWw8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="975" height="547" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The great thing I can say about the rumored Galaxy Buds 4 Pro is that they're still expected to lean into what Samsung's audio gear does best — software. In addition to classic features like game mode and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Samsung Seamless Codec (SSC)</a> support, the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are expected to add a "Find Your Phone" button on the charging case.</p><p>This button would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/galaxy-buds-4-pro-case-might-add-a-crucial-button-the-last-model-was-missing">let you ping your phone via Bluetooth</a> from the earbuds' case.

Then you simply select the device you want to stream to and playback will begin. As with other Chromecast playback, you'll be able to control everything directly from your phone.</p><p>The feature is already rolling out starting today. We were able to use it on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> with the latest version of the Apple TV app (version 2.2.0). If you don't see the Cast icon yet, just update the app through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.atve.androidtv.appletv">Google Play Store</a>.</p><h2 id="casting-from-apple-tv-app-on-android-is-now-possible-2">Casting from Apple TV app on Android is now possible</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h4tP62ip3bgksnb6qm8Cr" name="apple-tv-google-cast-support" alt="Apple TV app with Chromecast support" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4tP62ip3bgksnb6qm8Cr.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apple notes that this feature will make it easier for users to stream "award-winning" shows and movies like <em>Severance</em>, <em>Slow Horses</em>, <em>The Morning Show</em>, <em>Pluribus</em>, and <em>F1 The Movie</em>.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that Apple TV is slowly becoming a serious sports-streaming app with support for Major League Soccer, Friday Night Baseball, and Formula 1 races in the U.S. This expansion is great for users who don't own Apple devices but still want to stream content on the big screen.</p><p>The rollout comes at an interesting time.

It's only available in South Korea for now but global availability is expected to improve in 2026. The Z TriFold has similar dimensions as the Galaxy Z Fold 7 when folded, but it opens up to reveal a massive 10-inch display.</p><p>The third folding portion of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> has allowed Samsung to increase the battery capacity to 5,600mAh. It also supports Super-Fast Charging 2.0 at 45W which is said to deliver up to a 50% charge in just 30 minutes. The phone also supports 15W wireless charging and Samsung's Wireless PowerShare feature for reverse wireless charging. This is the fastest wired charging foldable from Samsung yet, although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei's Mate XT</a> tri-fold phone charges at 66W.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a first attempt, we feel Samsung has done a splendid job and we can attest to this as our Senior Editor, Harish Jonnalagadda, went hands-on with it at Dubai Mall. The folding pattern is also different from Huawei's approach which has an accordion-style design while the Galaxy TriFold opens up like two flaps of a box. Samsung has armed the Galaxy Z TriFold with solid specs as it's powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, 16GB of RAM, 512GB or 1TB of storage, and an IP48 rating.</p><p>The camera setup is similar to that of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 with a 200MP main sensor on the back. Noteably, the Galaxy Z TriFold only comes in one color called Crafted Black, with a Kevlar texture on the outside that looks pretty cool. When unfolded, the phone measures 3.9mm at its thinnest point. Because of the extra fold, the folded dimensions are much thicker than the z Fold 7 at 12.9mm. It's also a lot heavier at 309 grams.</p><p>Samsung is testing the waters with the Galaxy Z TriFold but it's already proving to be a huge hit. Despite the ~$2,430 price tag (when converted), the initial batch is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-sold-out-like-hot-cakes-in-its-overseas-debut">reportedly sold out</a> in South Korea and it could prove to be a popular premium product in other markets too. It's no doubt one of the most unique <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> out there that many mobile productivity enthusiasts will be waiting to get their hands on in 2026.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fc89202f-1d11-4574-b79e-5cc19e6e2ed0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Still great for the rest of us</strong></em></p><p>While all eyes are on the Galaxy Z TriFold right now, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is still one of the best foldables in the market that's easily available and more affordable.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Any existing S Pens will not work on the folding phone's inner or outer displays. Samsung also dropped S Pen from the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in 2025.</p></article></section><h2 id="s-pen-support-is-all-but-extinct-on-samsung-foldables-2">S Pen support is all but extinct on Samsung foldables </h2><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold is official as of Dec. 1, 2025, and it's set to go on sale in South Korea on Dec. 12 at 10 a.m. local time. Some details are still up in the air, like U.S. pricing and availability. We know the Galaxy Z TriFold will come to the U.S. sometime in the first quarter of 2026, but we don't know how much it will cost or have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-release-date">official release date</a>.</p><p>With that in mind, Samsung did release a complete specs sheet for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold">Galaxy Z TriFold</a>, and it sets the record straight on S Pen compatibility. No, the Galaxy Z TriFold will not support any S Pen model, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-z-trifold/specs/" target="_blank">official specs breakdown</a>. There's an "S Pen support" category on the Galaxy Z TriFold's product information page, and it clearly states S Pens are "not supported."</p><p>This isn't exactly surprising, but Galaxy fans may understandably be disappointed. The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold has a 10-inch AMOLED inner screen that's larger than some tablets, and a first-party stylus would've been excellent for drawing and note-taking. However, styluses for folding phones are tricky to make. There's often no space for an internally-housed S Pen — like the Galaxy S25 Ultra uses — and their inner screens are still fragile enough that a pointy S Pen tip could cause damage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4814px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ihqdSu9GTEx9FgovwdGvcT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-14" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ihqdSu9GTEx9FgovwdGvcT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4814" height="2708" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 pictured above, the Galaxy Z TriFold does not support the S Pen.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Samsung removed S Pen support from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> earlier in 2025. This was another early signal that the company is moving away from styluses for foldable phones entirely, including the Galaxy Z TriFold. The move was made on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to make the display assembly, and the phone itself, thinner. Since the Galaxy Z TriFold is thicker and folds twice, it's likely that adding a digitizer for S Pen support would've made the phone too thick.</p><p>The last Galaxy foldable to support an official S Pen was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, which worked with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-s-pen-pro-vs-s-pen-fold-edition">S Pen Fold Edition or S Pen Pro</a>. Newer models, including the Galaxy Z TriFold, have cut official stylus support entirely. You may be able to find third-party stylus options for the Galaxy Z TriFold, but these will lack the precision and integration of the official S Pen. You'll also have to make sure they won't damage the delicate Galaxy Z TriFold folding display.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold will make its way to the U.S. in early 2026, but unfortunately, it won't be coming with the S Pen in tow.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="005e2b38-ebef-4f28-b7ef-db33cb34646f">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-z-trifold/" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJKygHEi5oBmEN8fNhEH6a.jpg' alt="Product box image of the Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The latest and greatest</strong></em></p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Z TriFold features a 10-inch foldable AMOLED and a 6.5-inch cover screen, plus standalone DeX and usage as an external monitor for your PC.

The newer Watch 8 added a few improvements and upgrades, but the Watch 7 still holds up. It's especially competitive at this price point, being the lowest it's ever been and contrasting rivals with a lot of power and functionality.</p><p>This deal is for the 40mm version of the Watch 7, which includes a slightly smaller screen. For some, this is preferable to the 44mm for wearing while sleeping, and just being slightly less bulky overall. The discount is also only available for the Green configuration of the watch, though it typically also comes in Cream.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Watch 7: $249.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Watch 7: $249.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQKDML" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="5fkfzAa3nceSUcsYgLmsYP" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fkfzAa3nceSUcsYgLmsYP.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Galaxy-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQKDML" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Watch 7: $249.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Watch 7: $249.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$249.99</del> <strong>$129.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon has chopped the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 to the lowest price it's ever been, with a massive 48% discount for the holiday season.

These are great ways to kill time, but it's important to save battery life for crucial tasks, like making calls or using Google Maps for navigation. In a Pixel Drop, Google made it easier for users to get to their destination on low battery with the new Google Maps power saving mode.</p><p>Power saving mode in Google Maps is quite limited. It's not just restricted to Pixel phones. Instead, it's only available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">four Google Pixel 10 models</a>. If you happen to have one of the newest Pixel phones, you can extend your device's battery life with this feature. Here's everything you need to know about Google Maps power saving mode, and how to use it.</p><h2 id="what-you-need-to-use-google-maps-power-saving-mode-2">What you need to use Google Maps power saving mode</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8E7n8GwffFMP3nGd4HU9kW" name="Google-Pixel-10-Lemongrass-2" alt="Pixel 10d" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8E7n8GwffFMP3nGd4HU9kW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4021" height="2262" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-owners-get-a-whole-host-of-new-features-with-the-november-pixel-drop">November 2025 Pixel Drop</a>, Google added a power saving mode to Maps. It's exclusive to the four Pixel 10 models, namely the Google Pixel 10, Google Pixel 10 Pro, Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Google describes power saving mode as offering a "simple, low-power map" on your lock screen. It keeps necessary navigation information, like your next turn, easily visible on the screen. However, it cuts out a lot of the unnecessary visual elements, switching to a black-and-white UI to save power. Google says this can "significantly" extend your phone's battery life.</p><p>There are a few limitations in addition to the feature being a Pixel 10 exclusive. It'll only work while driving, and you can only use power saving mode in portrait orientation.</p><h2 id="how-to-enable-and-use-google-maps-power-saving-mode-2">How to enable and use Google Maps power saving mode</h2><p>To use Google Maps power saving mode, you'll need to enable the feature in the app's settings menu once. After that, the low-power battery view will be one button away for future navigation sessions. Here's how to enable, use, and disable Google Maps power saving mode:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Google Maps app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap your <strong>Google Account picture</strong>.</p><p>3. Press <strong>Settings</strong> and <strong>Navigation</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PogfB3jJ6RcRdoxrG88Vu8" name="Google-Maps-Power-Saving-Mode-1" alt="The screenshots for using Google Maps power saving mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PogfB3jJ6RcRdoxrG88Vu8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>4.

Since the feature only supports driving mode, a press of the power button will not activate power saving mode for walking, biking, or transit navigation sessions.</p><h2 id="when-to-use-google-maps-power-saving-mode-2">When to use Google Maps power saving mode</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7bosknD7AGHCZkXkxpMiGn" name="google-pixel-10-pro-and-pro-XL-all-colors-03" alt="All colors of the Google Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL line with a "PIXEL" sign behind them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7bosknD7AGHCZkXkxpMiGn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Maps has a lot of functionality, but its expansive feature set can drain your phone's battery life if you aren't careful. Now, you can turn off the unnecessary visual cues and features with one button thanks to Google Maps power saving mode. It's a toll every Google Pixel 10 owner should know about, as it might just help them get to their destination safely when their phone's battery is running on fumes.</p><p>Eventually, we're holding out hope Google Maps power saving mode might make its way to more Pixel models, and even other Android phones in the future. For now, it's yet another Google-exclusive perk for Pixel 10 users.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="91fece5e-a7c2-48fb-b1e0-254007a48bbb">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PMhL9mghoD6NWUtd7mbtEY.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 in Lemongrass"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Fully featured</strong></em></p><p>While we hope to see Google Maps power saving mode come to more devices in the future, for now, it's a Google Pixel 10 exclusive.

Let's look at everything we know so far in this speculative comparison.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dibuzRJrTDf5UjGxjeG2NE" name="Galaxy-S26-Plus-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of the Samsung Galaxy S26 leak online" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dibuzRJrTDf5UjGxjeG2NE.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rumors and leaks paint a picture of indecision on Samsung's part as the launch of the Galaxy S26 series nears. The company originally planned to shake up the lineup by releasing a Galaxy S26 Pro instead of the base model and a Galaxy S26 Edge instead of the midsize option, according to early reports. However, it's looking like Samsung will keep things traditional with a Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26 Plus, and Galaxy S26 Ultra — at least to start.</p><p>Samsung usually releases its phones in January each year, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/when-will-samsung-launch-the-galaxy-s26-one-leaker-claims-itll-be-later-than-usual">an October leak</a> claimed the Galaxy S26 lineup was delayed until March. More recently, rumors split the middle, with Samsung now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-release-date">expected to release the Galaxy S26 Plus</a> in late February 2026. It'll likely be priced at the same $999 starting price with options for 256GB or 512GB of storage.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is available now as the brand's top non-folding flagship. The phone retails for $1,199 for the base model with 256GB of storage, and it can be configured with up to 1TB. It's available in Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain, and Obsidian colorways.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Ya5KdRnBMqYw367nvvoxME" name="Galaxy-S26-Plus-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of the Samsung Galaxy S26 leak online" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ya5KdRnBMqYw367nvvoxME.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're expecting slight design changes for the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus, but the rumored differences simply align the smartphone with design languages of phones like the Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy Z Fold 7. Instead of having separated rear camera lenses like the Galaxy S25 Plus, the Galaxy S26 Plus will have a pill-shaped camera island that the three cameras will sit atop of. This is the biggest design change for the Galaxy S26 Plus, and it's a relatively minor one.</p><p>Overall, the Galaxy S26 Plus will still sport a rectangular and boxy chassis with flat aluminum side rails. It's still a glass sandwich, with Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2 securing the front and back of the phone. For durability, Samsung is expected to round out the experience with IP68 certification against dust and water ingress, which has been standard for a while now.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U8SkPHytXzMKEFf7gU534g" name="google-pixel-10-pro-jade-pixel-10-pro-xl-porcelain-backs" alt="The backs of the porcelain Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro standing next to each other on a bench" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U8SkPHytXzMKEFf7gU534g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Phone brands usually find a way to upgrade the display on their devices annually, whether it's a slight size increase, smaller bezels, or higher brightness.

That means you'll get a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel with QHD+ resolution.</p><p>If the current generation is any indication, we can expect 120Hz adaptive refresh rates, ProScaler for QHD+, and at least 2,600 nits of brightness.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="M3ZfEQpfnKQ8VM6YGGgkpZ" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-welcome-setup-01" alt="The welcome screen of a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M3ZfEQpfnKQ8VM6YGGgkpZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's Pixel 10 Pro XL is slightly larger, measuring 6.8 inches with a 1344 x 2992 resolution. It's also an AMOLED panel with 120Hz variable refresh rates. Google does have the advantage of a brighter, 3,300-nit display. The Pixel 10 Pro XL also includes an accessibility setting for PWM-sensitive people, but this only doubles the standard PWM rate, and might not be suitable for everyone.</p><p>From a design standpoint, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is just as boxy as the upcoming Galaxy S26 Plus. However, it has a horizontal pill-shaped camera island near the top of the phone. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is expected to be much thicker and heavier than the Galaxy S26 Plus, with the Pixel camera bar protruding even further.</p><p>Google does offer IP68 protection and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and back. Additionally, it crams Qi2 25W magnets inside the Pixel 10 Pro XL. While the Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus looks like it'll include Qi2 magnets, these might utilize the 15W standard.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dLqMe7oHakYTkaGYfTrzME" name="Galaxy-S26-Plus-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of the Samsung Galaxy S26 leak online" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dLqMe7oHakYTkaGYfTrzME.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus is expected to use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, at least in some regions. Samsung might use a dual-chip strategy, shipping the phone with an Exynos processor in other markets. Surprisingly, it looks like Samsung will still opt to pair these chips with only 12GB of memory.</p><p>By comparison, the Pixel 10 Pro XL ships with a weaker Tensor G5 chip, but it's paired with a higher 16GB of RAM. Google Tensor chips already excel at AI processing, and the additional memory will only expand the use cases for the Pixel 10 Pro XL's on-device AI support. Additionally, the extra RAM could help the Pixel 10 Pro XL support future features that will be added throughout the phone's seven-year software support window.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus (Rumored / Expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm (6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 in)</p></td><td  ><p>162.8mm x 76.6mm x 8.5mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability & Case Material(s)</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (front and back), Aluminum frame</p></td><td  ><p>Gorilla Glass Victus 2 front-and back, IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>190g</p></td><td  ><p>232g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED (1440x3120 pixels resolution), LTPO, 120Hz variable refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>6.8-inch Super Actua OLED, 1344 x 2992, 486 PPI, 1-120Hz, 3,300 nits</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset / SoC</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 (for Galaxy)</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Under-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Proximity sensor, Compass, and Barometer</p></td><td  ><p>Under-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, Ambient light sensor Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Proximity sensor, Magnetometer, and Barometer</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), Bluetooth 5.4, GPS, NFC, UWB, and USB-C 3.2 (with DisplayPort)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth v6, NFC, Dual-band GPS, 5G mmWave (NA only), 5G Sub-6, LTE</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Other Features</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung DeX (wired & wireless), Galaxy AI</p></td><td  ><p>Titan M2 chip, Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, single-camera face unlock, Google VPN</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery & Charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,900mAh (Si/C), 45W (wired) and 15W (wireless) charging, Full Qi2 Support</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh, 45W wired, 25W Qi2.2 Pixelsnap wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras (Rear)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide-angle, 10MP telephoto (3x optical zoom), 12MP ultrawide, 8K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 48MP 123-degree ultrawide with macro focus, 48MP 5x telephoto, 4K/60 10-bit HDR on all cameras, 8K/30 on rear cameras</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera (Front)</p></td><td  ><p>12MP wide-angle | 4K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>42MP 103-degree Dual PD AF selfie | 4K video recording </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS & Update Policy</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 with One UI 8.5 (preinstalled), seven years of OS and security updates</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (preinstalled), seven years of OS and security updates</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL has a newer camera assortment, with a 50MP primary shooter, a 48MP ultrawide lens, and a 48MP telephoto with up to 5x optical zoom.

Based on rumors and leaks, the Galaxy S26 Plus will do just that. With a new chip, magnetic charging, and slight camera improvements, Samsung looks to be doing <em>just</em> enough to stay compatitive. However, it could be doing more, and the overall design and feel might come off as stale to longtime Galaxy fans.</p><p>Google is heading in a different direction. Compare the Galaxy S26 Plus to the Galaxy S23 Plus, and you won't find major differences. Do the same for the Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Pixel 7 Pro and it's wildly different. Google exudes polish with its recent flagships, even if they're a bit thicker and heavier than I'd like. We can't fault anyone for going with the Pixel 10 Pro XL today as a result, but there's also a case for waiting for the cheaper Galaxy S26 Plus.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d36bc90e-c841-4def-80c9-f2fced7d482c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzkcj8YMqwNYbgHkLXibwc.jpg' alt="The rumored product render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Worth waiting for</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus might not offer a full revamp for Galaxy users, but there are still upgrades worth waiting for.

The latest Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio is rolling out now for developers in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI, and for Gemini Live and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-search-goes-live-with-this-new-feature-that-we-didnt-know-we-needed">Search Live</a> users.</p><p>The changes will make it easier to converse with Gemini while chatting live, and can improve the quality of Google's Live Voice Agents. Specifically, new Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio 12-25 model improves multi-turn conversation quality. When you chat with Gemini Live across multiple turns, it'll remember context from old turns. The extra context helps create "more cohesive conversations," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-audio-model-updates/" target="_blank">according to Google</a>.</p><p>The model is also better at interacting with external workflows without impacting the smoothness of your conversation. It can pick up on your audial cues to figure out when to access these outside functions. These external workflows can provide real-time information that Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio can subsequently insert into its audio responses.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5eA5aZpVYbs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Gemini's Live Voice Agent is also better at understanding and acting upon complex instructions from a user. Google says these upgrades result in "higher user satisfaction on content completeness." In other words, when interacting with a Live Voice Agent powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio 12-25, you may not need to demand to speak to a human representative. The artificial intelligence model might be able to handle more multi-step tasks on its own.</p><p>It's more reliable overall, with a 90% adherence rate to developer instructions. That's an increase of six percent compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-2-5-models-deep-think-flash-updates">older Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio</a> 9-25 model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XPg5Upx4kBvR5qovS6VixQ" name="gemini-audio_blog_light_blue_16x9_v1_25-12-12" alt="The improvements made to Gemini 2.5 Flash native audio." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XPg5Upx4kBvR5qovS6VixQ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the ComplexFuncBench Audio benchmark, the latest Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio model beats both its predecessor and OpenAI's gpt-realtime model with a score of 71.5%.</p><p>The upgraded Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio, as well as Live Voice Agents, are available now in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.

While Meta's Ray-Ban Display glasses aren't a prototype, they are positioned for early adopters, and we expect the company to continue expanding their capabilities over time. Ahead of 2026, Meta's CTO Andrew Bosworth is previewing what's next for Ray-Ban Display glasses, and the future looks bright.</p><p>The core <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-put-the-future-of-tech-on-your-face">Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses</a> experience is powered by the Meta Neural Band.

Owners are clamoring for a way to watch videos on the monocular display glasses, and in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@boztank/post/DSIq5gCFi64?xmt=AQF0rFyurSfEVTx-DO4J4vTwOICh2B1mUmrA3szVsde-Zw" target="_blank">a series of Threads comments</a>, Bosworth confirmed something is in the works. Support for Instagram Reels undergoes internal testing at Meta this month. Then, it'll roll out "in a couple of months."</p><p>Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Ray-Ban Display glasses cost $799</a>, and while that includes a custom-fitted Neural Band, it's an expensive early-adopter product. The monocular display (meaning there's only a screen in one lens) and limited prescription support further narrows down the glasses' niche. With that being said, it's looking like 2026 will bring exciting new features to the smart glasses.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If a photo had multiple objects or details, you had to rely on carefully worded prompts and hope Gemini focused on the right thing.</p><p>That approach worked sometimes, but it often felt like talking past the AI. The new markup tools aim to fill that gap by letting you guide Gemini visually rather than verbally (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-markup-tools-3625092/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>Once the feature is live for you, attaching an image in Gemini displays a brief note about a markup interface. From there, you can sketch directly onto the image or add text annotations. For example, you can circle an object, draw an arrow, highlight a section, or write a note. Gemini will use these markings as context when handling your request.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.63%;"><img id="dgXNfsBKsFinAzdwkrgA6W" name="Gemini-markup-tools" alt="new markup tools inside Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgXNfsBKsFinAzdwkrgA6W.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="410" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.63%;"><img id="sZXUYkCjtzBNHw8Ts4Lr7W" name="Gemini-markup-tools" alt="new markup tools inside Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sZXUYkCjtzBNHw8Ts4Lr7W.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="410" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.63%;"><img id="iZwV8Q65d2H25ragCHJY4W" name="Gemini-markup-tools" alt="new markup tools inside Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZwV8Q65d2H25ragCHJY4W.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="410" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.63%;"><img id="39Rhy48UKaD5VrhX8WGy7W" name="Gemini-markup-tools" alt="new markup tools inside Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/39Rhy48UKaD5VrhX8WGy7W.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="410" height="880" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Real-world usage is still a mixed bag.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>First available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-ai-mode-search-live-test-android-ios-underway">as a Google Labs experiment</a>, Search Live became a core part of the AI Mode experience when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-search-goes-live-with-this-new-feature-that-we-didnt-know-we-needed">debuted in the U.S. in September 2025</a>. It made it possible to have a back-and-forth conversation with AI while using Google Search. If you're familiar with Gemini Live, Search Live is similar, but its goal is to connect you with links and sites on the web. Now, it's becoming conversational thanks to a native audio model update.</p><p>The refresh brings responses that are "more fluid and expressive" to Search Live users. Powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-2-5-flash-native-audio-model">Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio 12-25 model</a>, the Search Live is more dynamic, adjusting its voice speed, tone, and style based on your preferences. Google announced the upgrade in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/live-audio-gemini-model-update/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, saying that Search Live users can now "enjoy smoother, more natural conversations."</p><p>Search Live's enhanced conversational understanding lets you customize how your AI's voice sounds on the fly. In the example <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kKyxgKSz3A" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> below, Google shows off Search Live answering a question about a rock, leveraging the live video feed and internet sources.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kKyxgKSz3A" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>In this example, Search Live responds with a fast-talking, bright, and enthusiastic voice. Then, the user asks Search Live to talk slower so their child can understand, and the voice immediately becomes deeper and more authoritative. It also speaks in a slower pace with more emphasis on enunciation in the delivery, so a young child can understand.</p><p>These changes happen in real time with no delay. They're specific to your current Search Live conversation, so you can ask for a custom speaking style every time you go live with AI Mode.</p><p>The upgrades come from the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> native audio model, which is also rolling out in Gemini Live, and is available for developers in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.</p><h2 id="when-you-can-try-search-live-s-smoother-conversations-2">When you can try Search Live's smoother conversations</h2><p>Search Live's upgraded conversations are rolling out for all U.S. users. The rollout began Dec. 12 and will continue over the course of this week. You can find it in the Google app for iOS and Android.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature, known as Motion Cues, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-could-steal-a-crucial-ios-18-feature-that-helps-curb-motion-sickness">discovered way back in 2024</a>. While the tool appears to be fully functional in Google Play Service, we're still waiting for a public release. Now, a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-17-motion-cues-rumor-3624642/" target="_blank">Android Authority's Mishaal Rahman</a> reveals that Motion Could debut within <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-17">Android 17</a> — and the reason why it's taking so long.</p><p>Like Apple's Vehicle Motion Cues, Google's version overlays motion dots to give the user signals as to which direction the vehicle is moving. This could allow people suffering from motion sickness to use their Android phone while riding in car. However, as currently built, Motion Cues can only display over other apps — not system elements.</p><p>As Android Authority discovered, Android's motion dots do not appear over the Settings app, status bar, notifications, Quick Settings, lock screen, or volume panel. The report explains that Android's default overlay API prevents the feature from working in these areas as a safety feature. The security restriction hampers Motion Cues' ability to create an immersive overlay of your vehicle's movement, as it can be interrupted by various system elements.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eZdFD8fNtjyu7rJ2fZkKd9" name="Motion-Cues-Android-Authority" alt="The Motion Assist feature in Android 17." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eZdFD8fNtjyu7rJ2fZkKd9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's solution to this problem could be to introduce a new Motion Cues API, per the report. There are signs in Android Canary's 2512 build that an upcoming Motion Cues API could use SystemUI for the rendering of motion dots. As the SystemUI app is responsible for handling system elements, the new API and integrations could solve the problems with Motion Cues in its current, unreleased form.</p><p>In a future update, Motion Cues could leverage both Google Play Services and SystemUI. The former might handle the location and appearance of Motion Cues, and SystemUI could be tasked with displaying them.</p><p>However, a new system API cannot be added with a Google Play Services update or a server-side push. Instead, new APIs are added through full operating system updates, like a quarterly Android release or a complete version update. As such, the earliest Motion Cues is likely to debut is alongside Android 16 QPR3, but Android 17 is starting to look most likely.</p><p>Motion Cues would be Android's answer to Apple's Vehicle Motion Cues. To differentiate the feature, Google could brand the finished product as Motion Assist. This name would fit nicely with other Google features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pixel-call-assist">Pixel's Call Assist</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>For messaging, most Google users turn to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>. The company also has a specialized messaging client for Workspace teams called Google Chat, though. Starting this week, Google is making two key changes to Chat that'll make the platform quicker and add a long-overdue messaging feature. These changes arrive as part of an extended rollout, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/12/a-new-web-address-for-google-chat.html" target="_blank">according to Google</a>, meaning they might take a few weeks to show up for everyone.</p><p>You might not know that the old web URL for Google Chat doesn't follow the typical Google format. Google Chat was originally found on the web at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://mail.google.com/chat" target="_blank">mail.google.com/chat</a>, and it's now moving to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://chat.google.com/" target="_blank">chat.google.com</a>. The small tweak might break some Google Chat extensions, so be sure to update your extensions to be compatible with the new URL.</p><p>Aside from the URL change giving Google Chat an online home separate from Gmail, the shift brings a big improvement for users. Google says the fresh URL reduces loading time, allowing Google Chat's web client to run faster. Crucially, it doesn't affect the Chat user interface, and bookmarks and links to the old URL will still work.</p><p>Separately, Google is adding a schedule send feature to Chat that works similarly to scheduling an email in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail">Gmail</a>. When creating a message in a Chat conversation, you can click the menu beside the send button to open the schedule. From there, you can pick a suggested schedule send time or choose a custom time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="iDjJwVQYWMVXQMhSSEYW8T" name="Clicking on the down arrow next to the Sent button brings up the Schedule send menu" alt="The schedule send feature in Google Chat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iDjJwVQYWMVXQMhSSEYW8T.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-chat">Google Chat</a> will now display a banner above the compose box when you have a scheduled message in a particular conversations. After they've been scheduled, you can manage scheduled messages by opening the new <strong>Drafts</strong> shortcut in the Chat sidebar. This new area will let Chat users edit, reschedule, or cancel messages.</p><p>Notably, you'll only see a Drafts page in the sidebar when you have active scheduled messages.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.50%;"><img id="BDvXwdQZSXUjXcMQUBPZ8T" name="New Drafts shortcut to edit, reschedule, send, and delete your scheduled messages" alt="The schedule send feature in Google Chat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BDvXwdQZSXUjXcMQUBPZ8T.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the new Google Chat URL and schedule send support are rolling out now for Workspace users on rapid release domains.

The new software version for Samsung smartphones brings features like a redesigned Quick Settings panel, updates to Quick Share, the ability to see all your files across all your devices, redesigned app icons, and more.</p><p>One of the new Galaxy AI features debuting with One UI 8.5 is the upgraded Photo Assist in the Gallery app, which allows you to apply AI edits to images without saving each iteration. It, however, appears Samsung is hiding even more Galaxy AI features within the build.</p><h2 id="ai-notification-summaries-may-remain-exclusive-to-galaxy-s26-at-first-2">AI notification summaries may remain exclusive to Galaxy S26 at first</h2><p>According to reliable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1999404746608939214">@chunvn8888 on X</a>, "lots" of One UI 8.5 features are not available right now because Samsung is keeping them exclusive to the Galaxy S26 series at launch.</p><p>One of the features the leaker mentions is the AI notification summary feature. This tool is reportedly part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-testing-smarter-notifications-one-ui-8-5-beta">One UI 8.5</a> but currently disabled. It will use Samsung's in-house Gauss model to provide users with a summary of their notifications from the past 24 hours.</p><p>The leaker adds that the feature will support several languages at launch including English, Korean, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Polish, simplified Chinese (中国大陆), Japanese, Hindi, Vietnamese, and Thai.</p><p>The feature will likely remain exclusive to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-accidentally-leaks-s26-design-one-ui-8-5">Galaxy S26 series</a> at first, with Samsung eventually rolling it out to other Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S25 series, Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy Z Flip 7, and more later.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sTrPFUQTZp4La3Zcff3vnS" name="Google Pixel AI Summaries" alt="Google Pixel AI Summaries" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sTrPFUQTZp4La3Zcff3vnS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If this feature sounds familiar, that's because it is.

This week, the entertainment giant sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google, claiming that Google’s AI tools have used Disney’s copyrighted material on a "massive scale" to train their models, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-google-ai-copyright-infringement-cease-and-desist-letter-1236606429/" target="_blank">Variety</a> reports.</p><p>Disney claims that Google’s AI models have been trained on and are producing unauthorized images and videos featuring popular Disney characters such as those from Frozen, The Lion King, Moana, The Little Mermaid, Deadpool, Guardians of the Galaxy, Star Wars, and others.</p><p>The company’s legal team also said that some of these AI-generated outputs include Google’s logo, which could make people think the content is officially approved by Disney.</p><p>Disney explained that it has raised these concerns with Google for months, but, as discussions did not resolve the issue, it decided to issue a formal legal warning to stop the alleged misuse of its intellectual property.</p><h2 id="google-begins-the-cleanup-2">Google begins the cleanup</h2><p>After receiving the notice, Google began working with Disney to take down dozens of AI-generated videos that featured popular characters, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/google-takes-down-disney-ai-videos-cease-desist-1236647823/" target="_blank">Deadline</a> reports.</p><p>The search giant maintains that it uses "public data from the open web" to train its models. A Google spokesperson emphasized their "longstanding and mutually beneficial relationship with Disney," pointing to tools they’ve built, such as Content ID, that help rights holders manage their work.</p><p>AI systems are usually trained on large amounts of data collected from the public web, which can include copyrighted material. This practice often goes unnoticed until well-known characters, such as Mickey Mouse or Elsa, appear in AI-generated content without permission.</p><p>However, Disney is not turning away from AI altogether.

This is the first time Android has offered this, and some beta testers are already using it.</p><p>Until now, Android users had to use "Starred Contacts" or repeat caller settings to filter unwanted calls, but those were always blunt instruments. Google is changing this with a new feature called Expressive Calling, now available in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-apps-simpler-layout-is-now-hitting-more-devices">Google Phone app</a> beta (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/13/google-phone-expressive-calling-beta/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>With this update, your contacts can tell you the reason for their call before you answer, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-app-may-soon-make-your-urgent-calls-hard-to-ignore">feature that was spotted in November</a> before Google made it official earlier this month.</p><p>The idea is straightforward but overdue. When you make a call, the app can ask if it’s urgent. If you choose urgent, the person you’re calling will see an “It’s urgent!” message along with an animated siren emoji.

Instead of calls being anonymous interruptions, Android can now add context to them. This is especially helpful when Do Not Disturb is on. Depending on the recipient’s settings, an urgent call can either break through Do Not Disturb or appear quietly, still marked as important.</p><h2 id="contacts-only-safety-net-2">Contacts-only safety net</h2><p>The main change is that you now have more choice. You’re no longer forced to whitelist people permanently just in case something goes wrong one day.</p><p>However, Expressive Calling is not available to everyone yet. For now, it only works if both the caller and the recipient are using the Phone app beta. This limits who can use it, but it also shows that Google is still testing the feature before releasing it widely.</p><p>Of course, there is a risk that people might misuse the urgent label. If every call is marked urgent, it will lose its meaning. Google seems to know about this risk, which is probably why the feature is being released slowly and with controls for users.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Another thing worth keeping in mind is that you can also trade in your smartphone on top of these discounts, lowering the price of your purchase even further.</p><p>It's also worth noting that this offer appears to be limited to certain Play Points users.

It's the same question I've been asking for years whenever a new Galaxy Tab is released, as Android just isn't well-suited for larger displays without a boatload of tinkering.</p><p>And it's not like you can just seamlessly install a different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-launchers" target="_blank">launcher</a>, because of API limitations, resulting in a very broken experience. Technically, it is possible, but installing and using different launchers requires a bit of tinkering with Bixby Routines or something like Tasker. Instead, I'll unfold the TriFold and be greeted by a home screen with more wasted space than you can shake a stick at.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="c4kqwsUK8ZKkTsCUb7PiNB" name="External Display settings in Desktop Mode" alt="External Display settings in Desktop Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4kqwsUK8ZKkTsCUb7PiNB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To be clear, I'm not talking about the "old" DeX Mode, which more closely resembled that of a desktop-like interface.

But it's for the same reason that I harp on Samsung and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Google</a> for not including flagship cameras in their most expensive phones.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> is an extremely performant processor, and will definitely last for as long as those trifold screens do.

Samsung launched pre-orders for the TriFold in its home country of South Korea, with an asking price of KRW 3,590,400. When converted to dollars, that equals about $2,400.</p><p>Which is surprising enough in its own right, as it's <em>only</em> $400 more than the base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.

And while that may not appeal to consumers who are a bit wary of AI, the new app redesign brings the Fitbit app into the modern Android era while making it feel more like a comprehensive fitness guide than the standard version.</p><p>At the moment, there still isn’t feature parity with the standard Fitbit app. But what’s new is rather interesting and makes me excited for the full version of the new app, which is expected to roll out sometime in 2.</p><p>For now, this is what it’s been like to use Fitbit’s new personal health coach preview.</p><h2 id="meet-me-in-the-middle-2">Meet me in the middle</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="FDtMpLjuspdaCtXqmoJSW8" name="Fitbit-Personal-Health-Coach-preview-12" alt="Fitbit personal health coach Today tab focus metrics" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FDtMpLjuspdaCtXqmoJSW8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After switching to the new preview for the first time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-get-started-fitbit-personal-ai-health-coach">setting up the new health coach preview</a> was a bit more involved than I expected. After a quick introduction and tapping through some notices regarding data use, I was invited to have a chat with the AI health coach. Where the previous app simply had you input your goals, such as daily steps and sleep, the health coach turns the process into a conversation.</p><p>During this process, I talked to it about what I hoped to achieve and what I think works or doesn’t work for me. The coach was about as responsive as I expected from a Gemini-powered AI, and it seemed to be making a genuine effort to get to know me and understand my goals. I told it that I was looking to gain muscle and lose body fat while also hoping to build enough endurance to run my first 5K.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="vrdy4722iqbYRSdWvBxUQ8" name="Fitbit-Personal-Health-Coach-preview-01" alt="Fitbit personal health coach setup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vrdy4722iqbYRSdWvBxUQ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I was then directed to have a separate chat to set up a workout plan, though this is optional. The AI drew on what it knew about me from our previous conversation and came up with a plan to help me achieve it, while keeping certain details in mind, such as my asthma (it suggested lighter runs as a result).</p><p>I didn’t like the first suggestion it gave me, since I wanted to incorporate some of what I already do, such as a daily morning run and instructor-led yoga, Pilates, and HIIT on Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesdays, respectively.

When I select a session, there's no option to start a workout from the app. Instead, I have to go into my watch and start my own workout manually. From there, I have to manually mark in the app that I've finished each set/session, enter my reps, and input my total weight.</p><p>This differs from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin</a>, where I can set up a plan, access it on the watch, and follow each exercise from my wrist, which can also save my reps and weight without me needing to touch my phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="jtrywuHChhDv3AoNiJSME8" name="Fitbit-Personal-Health-Coach-preview-07" alt="Fitbit personal health coach "Mark workout as done" button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jtrywuHChhDv3AoNiJSME8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's just too much manual input, including having to link my tracked workout to the scheduled one.

On Garmin, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-fitness-heart-rate-steps">reps are automatically counted</a>, sets automatically start and stop, and the watch can fairly accurately determine which exercises you're doing just by how you're moving.

Some, like Garmin smartwatches, are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">better than others</a>, but they still don't compare to using one for people without mobility issues.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't see this changing any time soon, if ever.</p><h2 id="we-re-built-different-2">We're built different</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ReQt7HNf2JKsWow7hoJ4fN" name="Fitbit-Premium-Health-Coach-Today-tab" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 sitting next to a Pixel 9a open to the Fitbit app, showing the Fitbit Premium Health Coach preview with the Today tab open; it shows new widgets and insights." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ReQt7HNf2JKsWow7hoJ4fN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The difficulty in creating accurate and useful fitness trackers for wheelchair users stems from a combination of technological limitations, fundamental differences in movement, and a historical lack of dedicated research and market focus.</p><p>The core technology in most commercial wearables is designed for the "able-bodied" population, which creates fundamental inaccuracies when applied to wheelchair use. I'm talking smartwatches here, because something as small as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> or s<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/lumia-2-launches-as-the-first-customizable-smart-earrings-that-track-your-overall-health">mart earrings</a> simply doesn't have the space to fit anything more inside.</p><p>Wearable trackers primarily use an accelerometer to count steps by detecting specific motions involved in walking or running. That data is what's used to calculate other features, like calorie counting or a sort of body battery measurement.</p><p>When you use a manual wheelchair, the arm and torso movements are different from they are when walking or running. This usually leads to either an overestimation or an underestimation of "steps" and calories burned. A simple accelerometer is not designed to measure these.</p><h2 id="different-tech-is-needed-2">Different tech is needed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KnRXHNGqaUaah6kE3S3xMR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-review-29" alt="Garmin Venu 4 Elevate sensor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KnRXHNGqaUaah6kE3S3xMR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The software algorithms that determine energy expenditure use a combination of data such as heart rate, height, and weight, and accelerometer readings. To make matters worse, all this is designed with lower-body movement in mind.</p><p>To push a wheelchair, you rely on your upper body. Usually, this is less demanding than "normal" leg-based movements. This means that even if a wearable <em>underestimates</em> your number of pushes, the result can still be <em>overestimated</em> because your body isn't working as hard to move forward.</p><p>It's difficult to reasonably assess any sort of fitness goal when things are both over- and underestimated all at the same time. Garmin, to its credit, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/health-science/wheelchair-physiology/?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&zebratwo=CJ&cjevent=809df364d6cb11f08069033d0a82b820&utm_source=CJ&utm_medium=Text" target="_blank">does explain how it tries to compensate</a> for this and use a different software algorithm when you use Wheelchair Mode on one of the company's watches.</p><p>Apple, Samsung, and Google are all working on making it better, too, even if they aren't quite there yet. Even with my Garmin, the readings and calculations aren't very accurate because of differences in movement and the limitations of "normal" sensors in gauging it.</p><p>Modern medicine isn't likely to change how people in wheelchairs use their bodies to move, but technology could be built that caters to it. The University of Pittsburgh’s Human Engineering Research Lab is working on how to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3058074/these-scientists-are-building-fitness-trackers-that-work-for-people-with-disabilities">build a fitness tracking system for people with ambulatory issues, </a>but it would probably lead to an entirely new product category of devices. Their research involves wearable tech on the wrist and face (to monitor breathing and oxygen intake) as well as tech on the wheelchair itself. Think of a smart chair, like we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-partners-adidas-launch-new-smart-insole-can-track-your-soccer-skills">Google explore smart shoe insoles</a>.</p><h2 id="the-market-isn-t-there-2">The market isn't there</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK" name="Garmin_Venu3_push-counting-1.jpg" alt="Garmin Venu 3 push tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZyoCdfDsYxkEMwu5CmwMSK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Maybe a bigger issue is the market itself and historical research into the problem. I'm not complaining that people without any issues walking around don't think about wheelchair users, and I never want to sound demanding. The fact is that not as much research goes into wheelchair fitness tracking. This can change and probably will, but it's unlikely to catch up.</p><p>The market simply isn't there to justify the enormous costs. There are more people with ambulatory issues than you probably realize, but the number is still dwarfed by those without any. And, to be frank, many people in a wheelchair just don't care about their fitness. For every wheel-basketball player (those guys are amazing and my heroes), there will be dozens (or more) users who aren't interested in seeing how active they can be. To be fair, it is tough to give a damn when you live in a world that wasn't designed to accommodate you.</p><p>In any case, the number of people who would buy a costly fitness-tracking system will never be high. Any company willing to do the research isn't going to profit from it, and companies that actually build the devices would probably lose money. For now, it's in the hands of forward-looking thinktanks like the University of Pittsburgh.</p><h2 id="for-now-i-ll-stick-with-my-garmin-2">For now, I'll stick with my Garmin</h2><p>I'm not bitter. I've learned how to use the information my Garmin watch gives me, and even though I can't trust it at face value, it is mostly consistent. It's useful to help in some ways; I lift weights to keep my upper body strong, and it can help me there.</p><p>If things ever change, I would try to buy into a better way, though I'm in the minority. I'm just happy that big tech hasn't forgotten about me, even if they're taking a long time to produce mediocre results.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With features like "PC Connect" and "Likeness," Google is reimagining creativity, giving users more room to be productive with the multi-view screen and a digital avatar of you that mirrors your facial expressions and hand gestures in real-time, during team meetings.</p><p>As for Project Aura, which is supposedly equipped with a 70-degree field of view and optical see-through technology, these glasses are said to overlay the digital content within your field of view, turning it into a massive screen for work or entertainment.</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-5-is-here-sorta-2">One UI 8.5 is here...

While it might sound like a small software tweak, One UI 8.5 brings new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 series</a> for now.</p><p>This includes an updated Photo Assist that helps you continue without saving each iteration on your device. This means you can use AI Eraser, then move or restyle the image in Photo Assist without saving it first.</p><p>With this new beta update, Samsung also adds new Theft Protection tools, a redesigned UI with 3D icons, and a customizable Quick Settings panel. Storage Share lets users access files across Galaxy phones, tablets, PCs, and even Samsung TVs. Many apps, including Calculator, Clock, and Samsung Health, have been redesigned for better visuals.</p><p>The One UI 8.5 beta is only available on Galaxy S25 series smartphones.

Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich and Derrek Lee got a package from Motorola earlier this week, and the box had an invite to its CES display, plus a wooden flip book that opens and folds into a lamp, with a dim red light.</p><p>According to Sutrich, the lamp features a magnetic clasp that keeps it fully open and folded backward. The most obvious indication is within the invite itself, which states, "We're getting ready to unfold a new perspective at Lenovo Tech World, set to take place on January 6." The emphasis on "unfold" caught our attention, given that Motorola's current foldable phones are all Flip devices.</p><p>The mysterious device might also feature a wooden finish, as suggested by the wooden cover of the foldable lamp. It also has the Motorola "M" logo engraved on it, with the line "every fold reveals a possibility."</p><h2 id="december-pixel-update-got-bugg-y-for-some-2">December Pixel update got bugg-y for some</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uPmu5rhFzr7dnamiB939CQ" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-puck-02" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPmu5rhFzr7dnamiB939CQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsungs-next-galaxy-watch-ultra-wont-land-in-2025-heres-why-the-2026-reboot-matters"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Google recently rolled out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/december-drop-google-brings-fresh-updates-for-android-users">Android 16 QPR2 update</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10</a> series.

Following the update, many Pixel 10 series users report that the Pixel Stand (2nd Gen) no longer works, even though it previously worked at the "perfect angle." As reported on Reddit, placing a Pixel 10 on the Stand now causes it to flash orange and white and reportedly throw a charging error, suggesting Google intentionally broke support.</p><p>This only seems to suggest that Google wants to push its new Qi2 chargers to Pixel 10 owners, officially ending support for others on the market.</p><h2 id="qualcomm-brings-two-mid-range-chips-to-the-areana-2">Qualcomm brings two mid-range chips to the areana</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:814px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.14%;"><img id="kbidJCdCpXnihJvWUTTP3C" name="qualcomm-extends-support-for-updates-on-android-devices-snapdragon-8-elite" alt="Qualcomm 8 years support for phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kbidJCdCpXnihJvWUTTP3C.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="814" height="457" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-update-changelog-leaked"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Qualcomm announced two chips today (Dec 11) for the mid-range and entry-level markets: the Snapdragon 6s 4G Gen 2 and the Snapdragon 4 Gen 4.

Similarly, the camera app on many foldable phones, such as the Oppo Find N5, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>, offers a feature that splits the camera into two halves, with the viewfinder on the right and previews of recent shots on the left.</p><p>While most foldable smartphone makers have offered this feature, Google surprisingly missed out.

However, as with every piece of software, these updates are not always perfect.</p><p>Some system app updates contain issues as well, and many of us have had to roll back to a previous version of an app to continue using it as it worked before the update. One of the easiest ways to do that until now was to go directly to the Play Store listing for that system app and tap the Uninstall updates button.</p><p>And while this option was convenient since you didn't need to dig into any settings, it seems like it's going away.</p><h2 id="rolling-back-system-apps-now-needs-extra-steps-2">Rolling back system apps now needs extra steps</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6LRN4wW4DEJfhgH6ggFKaT" name="play-store-uninstall-app-updates" alt="Play Store app listings with Uninstall app update button gone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6LRN4wW4DEJfhgH6ggFKaT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-play-store-uninstall-button-2-3624705/">Android Authority</a>, the button to uninstall updates for system apps in the Google Play Store is now gone. The change appears to be widespread and is already rolling out to all devices, and it isn't tied to any specific Play Store version. For me, the option is also gone on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> running Play Store version 49.1.33-31.</p><p>While the Play Store listing previously showed an Uninstall button for these system apps, the option is now gone entirely, leaving a blank white space where the button used to be. Moreover, as the report suggests, apps that don't show up in the app drawer, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> and Android System WebView, are also affected by this change.</p><p>We don't yet know why Google is doing this, and there doesn't seem to be a clear reason behind the change for now. However, the option disappearing from the Play Store doesn't mean you can no longer downgrade or uninstall system app updates.</p><p>You can still uninstall system app updates by going to the app's settings, tapping the three-dot menu, and selecting Uninstall updates. It's just that the option has now been removed from the Play Store.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The problem is most likely due to Google’s move to newer software. In September, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/google-phasing-out-wear-os-weather-app">stopped offering the Weather app for devices running Wear OS 6</a>.</p><p>The plan was to push users toward manufacturer-specific apps, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-weather-app-coming-to-pixel-watch">new Pixel Weather on the Pixel Watch 2, 3, and 4</a>. However, Google explicitly stated that the legacy app would continue working for anyone who already had it installed.</p><p>That promise has run into trouble. The prevailing theory — at least on Reddit — is that Google pushed an update intended for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> that inadvertently broke compatibility with older firmware versions. Since the original Pixel Watch still uses older software, the app and the watch are not working together.</p><p>Google’s support representative said the team is aware of the issue and is working on a firmware update to fix it. However, there is no clear timeline for when the fix will arrive. This is frustrating for users, especially since these devices are failing at a basic task.</p> ]]></dc:content>
