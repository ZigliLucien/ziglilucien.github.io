While the colors appear to be familiar to the previous iteration, the design of the phone itself is notably different. Irrespective of the colors, there is some sort of neon-themed power button, which at first glance is similar to previous Pixel phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-3-review">Pixel 3</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="hCrNQ7xprP4UfdQznT5CZH" name="Fairphone-6-render-leak-01" alt="Fairphone 6 leaked renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hCrNQ7xprP4UfdQznT5CZH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roland Quandt/ via Winfuture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We will likely see more flat edges, and the protruding camera visor is ditched in favor of an individually placed camera system at the back.</p><p>Per the leaked marketing images of the alleged Fairphone 6, we should be seeing a back cover right under the camera sensors featuring just a couple of screws. When unscrewed, users are likely to be greeted with an option to remove the battery as well as it isn’t attached to the device with the help of glue but rather with additional screws.</p><p>The publication further notes that the same process is likely to be applied to the cameras, display, and speaker module — all serving the purpose of the sustainable phone, which the Fairphone 6 aims to be.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="mgyoG2Hx6ufy2fFh6D7DZH" name="Fairphone-6-render-leak-02" alt="Fairphone 6 leaked renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mgyoG2Hx6ufy2fFh6D7DZH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roland Quandt/ via Winfuture)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="t5LMuvAMdj3KmDSrKgv9YH" name="Fairphone-6-render-leak-03" alt="Fairphone 6 leaked renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t5LMuvAMdj3KmDSrKgv9YH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roland Quandt/ via Winfuture)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The device is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-6-leaks-reveal-modular-design-and-an-anticipated-launch-date">set to launch</a> on June 25 starting at €549, and the specifications of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android handset</a> include a 6.31-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, along with Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 under the hood paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB built-in storage, which is further expandable through microSD for up to 2TB.</p><p>A 4415mAh battery capacity is expected to power the Fairphone 6 with support for 33W fast charging.

While it was confined to earbuds, the company  is debuting over-ear headphones dubbed Headphone 1. Ahead of the launch, we now have the first proper look at them, revealing their design.</p><p>The leak comes from multiple sources (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/20/nothing-headphone-1-leaks-show-off-unique-translucent-design-gallery/">9to5Google</a>), which showcases the alleged Headphone 1 in all its glory.

They will further feature translucent design, the elements of which were teased by the company for over the past few weeks. As for colorways, they are likely to debut in some kind of jet black color alongside silver/white color options.</p><p>Nothing's next pair of headphones appears to be carrying two physical buttons on one ear cup, and the ear cups are likely to fold flat for easy carrying.</p><p>While one ear cup carries the Headphone 1 moniker, the other ear cup incorporates "Sound by KEF" branding, complementing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-taps-kef-expanded-refined-audio-experience">announcement</a> made by Nothing last month.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/YvBZAD34pz<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1935991321484759421">June 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Other video leaks shared by tipster Arsène Lupin on X also reveal the Headphone 1 in action worn by a couple of people in what appears to be some kind of Nothing store.

Ask it back then, and it would just point you to another app.</p><p>But according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/19/gemini-app-song-search/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, that’s changed. Over the past few weeks, Gemini quietly picked up built-in song search, finally closing a major gap with its predecessor and making it feel more like a fully-loaded assistant for Android users.</p><h2 id="just-ask-and-play-2">Just ask and play</h2><p>To try out Gemini’s new song ID skill, just say, “What song is this?” It’ll then launch a full-screen mode and ask you to play, sing, or hum the tune. While it listens, you’ll see that signature pulsing sphere in action as it hunts down the closest match using Google’s smarts.</p><p>Gemini’s music-matching skills work across the board, meaning it can catch songs playing nearby, in your playlists, or even ones you hum.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:383px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.54%;"><img id="cDwTGfCjCkhBQqv5m5FbKi" name="Gemini-app-song-search" alt="song search feature in the Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cDwTGfCjCkhBQqv5m5FbKi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="383" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:383px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.54%;"><img id="iWkGF5cojPYZznXhM83aKi" name="Gemini-app-song-search" alt="song search feature in the Gemini app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iWkGF5cojPYZznXhM83aKi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="383" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="still-a-bit-clunky-2">Still a bit clunky</h2><p>While Gemini on Android can now ID songs, it’s not fully baked into the Gemini experience just yet. When you ask it to name a tune, it actually hands things off to the Google app’s full-screen listening mode.</p><p>It works, but it’s not as smooth or seamless as something like Pixel’s built-in Now Playing feature, which still takes the lead when it comes to smooth song ID. You can trigger it with a quick voice command or tap the lock screen shortcut, and it delivers results right in the interface. Plus, it works offline, which is a major win.</p><p>Another thing that sets Gemini’s song ID apart from a fully integrated setup is that it shows the results on a Google Search page instead of keeping it in the chat. So instead of a smooth, in-line answer like you’d get from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>, you’re bumped out of the conversation flow, making the experience feel a bit disjointed.</p><p>Currently, Song Search is only live in Gemini on Android. Google hasn’t officially said when (or if) it’s coming to iOS, but chances are it’s just a phased rollout.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's a journey that's taken me five years to get to, and while I've slowly climbed the ranks among my fellow Spartans over the years, I still have a <em>long</em> way to go before I ever consider the possibility of making the podium.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Sunday Runday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rV2GgqHS9nqccNipGMkWqB" name="lloyd-break-dancing.jpg" caption="" alt="Lloyd, the Android Central mascot, break-dancing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rV2GgqHS9nqccNipGMkWqB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">Sunday Runday is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/sunday-runday">weekly column</a> that talks about the world of wearables, apps, and fitness tech related to running and health. Normally written by Android Central Wearables Editor Michael Hicks, this week is a guest post by Android Central Senior Editor Nicholas Sutrich, who has been on a fitness journey since 2020 when he tried CrossFit for the first time.</p></div></div><p>Regardless if I ever podium, though, the key to improvement is through training. Quantifying my results with a smartwatch is extraordinarily helpful, but with the variety of obstacles and types of fitness found throughout a Spartan race, which watch is the best way to track things?</p><p>I turned to two of my favorites from last year, the OnePlus Watch 3 and Google Pixel Watch 3, both of which I've regularly turned to because of their fitness-tracking accuracy and detailed stats. And while I prefer the smaller size of the 41mm Pixel Watch 3, the battery life of the OnePlus Watch 3 is an even better plus.</p><p>After I finished the race, I compared my stats using a combination of tools. Strava pulled the data off my OnePlus Watch 3, while Google's Fitbit does all the work for the Pixel. All of those were dumped into a web-based tool called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://quantified-self.io">Quantified Self</a>, which makes it easy to directly compare stats and GPS-tracked maps at a glance. Now, for the results.</p><h2 id="let-s-get-spartan-2">Let's get Spartan</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7yWScscKFK2EGWfJYJJnUb" name="oneplus-watch-3-google-pixel-watch-3-spartan-race-map" alt="A GPS-generated map of a Spartan Race comparing the OnePlus Watch 3 and Google Pixel 3's GPS tracking accuracy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7yWScscKFK2EGWfJYJJnUb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you've never attended a Spartan Race before, here's the gist. Spartan Races come in three lengths: Sprint (5K, 20+ obstacles), Super (10K, 25+ obstacles), Beast (21K, 30+ obstacles), and Ultra (50K, 60+ obstacles). Obstacles are a variety of challenges that include anything from rope climbs to crawling under barbed wire, angled walls that you have to run or climb over, and even carrying heavy objects for a set length.</p><p>To date, I've only run Sprints and have no intention of running longer. I'm not Michael Hicks, and I can't run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-i-learned-running-20-mile-race-wearing-four-watches" target="_blank">20-mile races</a>, but I have participated in Ninja Warrior competitions in the past, so obstacles are my strong suit. The varied nature of a Spartan Race makes it tough to measure with a watch that's built for running, but they still provide a good measure of data to work with for comparison.</p><p>Normally, I run Spartan Races in my home state of North Carolina, where things are a lot hillier, but I decided to try one while on vacation in the much flatter (and hotter) state of Florida.</p><div ><table><caption>Post-run 20-miler stats from four fitness watches</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus Watch 3</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Distance</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5.26 Km</p></td><td  ><p>5.33 Km</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Pace</strong></p></td><td  ><p>11:37 min/km</p></td><td  ><p>11:05 min/km</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Ascent / Decent</strong></p></td><td  ><p>0 m / 0 m</p></td><td  ><p>35 m / 50 m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Avg. / max heart rate</strong></p></td><td  ><p>177 bpm / 195 bpm</p></td><td  ><p>177 bpm / 200 bpm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Running power average / max</strong></p></td><td  ><p>93 W / 532 W</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Calories</strong></p></td><td  ><p>852 kcal</p></td><td  ><p>864 kcal</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Steps</strong></p></td><td  ><p>7,049</p></td><td  ><p>7,042</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Cadence</strong></p></td><td  ><p>117 spm</p></td><td  ><p>112 spm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Stride length</strong></p></td><td  ><p>0.74m</p></td><td  ><p>0.74m</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Vertical oscillation</strong></p></td><td  ><p>7.7cm</p></td><td  ><p>8.1cm</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>While both watches are pretty even keel across the board, a few stats stood out to me. First off is the elevation change, where the OnePlus Watch 3 seemed to think Florida is a lot flatter than it actually is.</p><p>While the majority of the circuit through Burt Aaronson South County Regional Park in Boca Raton is extraordinarily flat by my North Carolinian standards, several obstacles were above or below the elevation of most of the rest of the course.</p><p>The bucket carry, for instance, had me trek up a man-made hill that was a few dozen feet high, while another obstacle had us wading through a pond that we had to navigate down a hill to reach.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.12%;"><img id="yiLsHsMLGD4Nj8PvptJRjW" name="oneplus-watch-3-google-pixel-watch-3-spartan-race-altitude" alt="Altitude measurements during a Spartan race while wearing a OnePlus Watch 3 and a Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yiLsHsMLGD4Nj8PvptJRjW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3062" height="1504" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the graph, it's clear something malfunctioned on the OnePlus Watch 3. Whether this was a bug or something else, I'm not sure, but I know that I didn't get accurate altitude information from the OnePlus Watch 3. I've never seen it do this outside of this one race (of course), and I've taken it hiking several times.</p><p>I know this was a fluke though, because when I look at the rest of the data, both watches are impressively neck-and-neck. This is impressive to me because it confirms my thoughts in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3 initial impressions</a> where I said that OnePlus fixed all the issues I had with the OnePlus Watch 2, namely giving it accurate fitness tracking capabilities.</p><p>OnePlus outfitted the OnePlus Watch 3 with a more precise dual-frequency GPS, and it shows when you zoom into the map. In the map below, the OnePlus Watch 3 is <strong>orange</strong>, while the Pixel Watch 3 is <strong>blue</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:985px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:46.29%;"><img id="utcBdHXhpV6apZLkGDksHb" name="oneplus-watch-3-google-pixel-watch-3-spartan-race-map-01" alt="A GPS-generated map of a Spartan Race comparing the OnePlus Watch 3 and Google Pixel 3's GPS tracking accuracy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/utcBdHXhpV6apZLkGDksHb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="985" height="456" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I know from running the course that I wasn't running around as erratically as the Pixel Watch 3 suggests. For instance, I know I didn't run under the trees on the right side of the image. I stuck to the path as the OnePlus Watch 3's track shows.</p><p>Likewise, the strange loop you see on the left side from the Pixel Watch 3 didn't happen like it shows. That was a 20-foot rope wall that I had to scale, then flip around and make my way back down. The OnePlus Watch 3 has a similar circular motion to the path, but it's much more inline with my actual movements.</p><h2 id="which-is-best-2">Which is best?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-google-pixel-watch-3" alt="Wearing a OnePlus Watch 3 and a Google Pixel Watch 3 on separate arms to compare them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gTkpyfbJXQDEEZgpK7BhoC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Looking at the rest of the bevy of available stats — it's seriously overwhelming if you don't know what these mean — it's clear both watches are close enough to each other in tracking to call this a tie. Even the heart rate was dead on, showing a 177 bpm average for the duration of the hour-long race.</p><p>For me, the choice between the two can be broken down into two main points. Want a smaller smartwatch that's extra comfortable to wear? The Google Pixel Watch 3 is the best choice for that right now, but a smaller OnePlus Watch 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-expands-its-mid-tier-lineup">is on the way</a> that will surely challenge it.</p><p>If you want a watch with excellent fitness-tracking capabilities and a battery that'll last you an average of 4 days on a single charge — yes, even with regular fitness and GPS tracking — the OnePlus Watch 3 is a no-brainer. This is OnePlus's best year yet, and it's great to see the company improving its products in meaningful ways that mean you won't have to sacrifice something when choosing them.

Smaller sensors and lower resolutions sometimes can result in noisier images that just don't look as good.</p><p>Flip phones still have front-facing cameras on the display, but to be honest, I rarely ever use them, and if I do, it's to hop on a video call. But if I ever want to take a selfie, I close the phone and turn on the camera. This way, not only can I view myself using the cover screen, but it lets me take selfies with the superior quality of the primary camera.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="PDzsWCXuPt3JBd5F7Lm5dj" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-camera-sample-9.jpg" alt="Taking a selfie in front of a ferris wheel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PDzsWCXuPt3JBd5F7Lm5dj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's great is that you don't need an expensive flip phone to make it happen; even the cheaper ones with smaller cover screens normally provide a selfie preview. Of course, it's just better with a larger cover screen so you can get the full effect.</p><p>The Razr also has a fun Photobooth feature that automatically takes four photos after a short countdown. Once it's done, it'll stitch them into a fun 4x4 collage.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-capturing-your-best-angles"><span>Capturing your best angles</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kmxA8vznEPkq9pPkTqSiFo" name="motorola-razr-plus-2024-closed-camera-viewfinder-01" alt="Taking a picture of me taking a picture of the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 with its cover screen camera viewfinder active" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmxA8vznEPkq9pPkTqSiFo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the worst things is to have your picture taken by someone else, only for it to come out badly or show you at an awkward angle. You're pretty much at the mercy of whoever is capturing the photo, and you just have to hope that at least one of the voters that they're taking comes out good enough to post on Instagram.</p><p>With most flip phones, this becomes a thing of the past. With their expansive cover screens, phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip</a> allow you to turn on a preview of the viewfinder. That way, when you're taking a photo of someone, they can see themselves and angle themselves appropriately, ensuring that you're capturing their best side.</p><p>I use this anytime I take photos of friends, and they always comment on how cool and useful it is that they can see themselves.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-this-one-s-for-the-tiktokers"><span>This one's for the TikTokers</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cd5KaAGAXKDYu4ARsYcVQc" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-auto-zoom-selfie-01.jpg" alt="The Auto Zoom on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cd5KaAGAXKDYu4ARsYcVQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're a TikToker or content creator, this one's for you. Instead of buying a tripod or another accessory to prop your phone up while recording a video, you can just take a flip phone, set it down somewhere, and fold it at an angle. With the cover screen viewfinder, you'll be able to see yourself while you record your videos. And again, since you're not using the front camera, the quality should be much better than with a traditional smartphone.</p><p>This is one of my favorite ways to take hands-free "selfies" that don't look like selfies and appear to have been taken by someone else. This works great when paired with Air Gestures, which activate a short countdown when you hold your hand up at the camera. And for video, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-camera-review">Razr Ultra</a> also lets you control videos in a similar fashion, letting you start, pause, or end video recording by showing your palm or fist.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MgWpePvVCJjkwATPLpDGXf" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2025-paddleboard" alt="The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 on a paddleboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MgWpePvVCJjkwATPLpDGXf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, it can also be a great way to capture footage of not just yourself, but also of other things.

He set the phone down in front of him on the board and just started recording. It's nice because he was able to capture video of his time on the lake with the Razr while his hands were focused on navigating the paddleboard (with the Razr secured to the board, of course).</p><p>And if you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-first-things">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, you can take advantage of a cool auto zoom feature.

It's not always easy to get them to look directly into the camera, especially babies. Fortunately, this is something Motorola has thought of with what it likes to call the camera cartoon.</p><p>This feature uses the cover screen to display a colorful series of animated faces that it cycles through in order to grab a child’s attention. That way, you can grab the perfect shot without constantly having to flail around behind the camera, and the faces should hopefully get a smile or laugh out of the kid.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fewer-cameras-more-versatility"><span>Fewer cameras, more versatility</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Zrr3bhnvNUnDws25RyWj2B" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-34" alt="Pantone icon on the Razr Ultra 2025 camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zrr3bhnvNUnDws25RyWj2B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3962" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the main complaints about flip phones is that they often come equipped with only two cameras.

That couldn't be farther from the truth.</p><p>In fact, thanks to their foldable form factor and cover screen, flip phones manage to make their dual camera systems more versatile than traditional smartphones, and in ways that their non-folding counterparts can't really replicate. It's part of what makes them so unique, and a key reason why you should consider buying a flip phone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But a recent leak suggested that the company could be ditching the "14" and launching the OnePlus 15 instead. Some speculate that this could be due to cultural reasons, as in China, the number "4" sounds similar to the word for "death," making it an unlucky number.</p><p>That aside, the rumor also suggests that the Chinese company could be letting go of its long-term relationship with its camera partner, Hasselblad. The two have been working together since the launch of the OnePlus 9, which led to OnePlus having one of the best cameras on the market.</p><p>But if this rumor holds true, then OnePlus could be looking at a new camera setup for its phone this time around.</p><hr><h2 id="oakley-x-meta-s-new-smart-glasses-look-insane-2">Oakley X Meta's new smart glasses look insane</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DFriMMMuYfzw7PqyL8VnrK" name="oakley-meta-hstn-official-lifestyle-07" alt="Official lifestyle shots of a person wearing Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DFriMMMuYfzw7PqyL8VnrK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-and-metas-new-smart-glasses-are-built-for-athletes-and-they-look-insane"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Just like Meta's Ray Ban smart glasses, the company has now collaborated with Oakley to bring a sportier pair of smart glasses that could be your go-to accessory on your next run this summer.</p><p>Oakley and Meta have teamed up to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-smart-glasses-teaser">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> (pronounced HOW-stuhn).

The device sports a 6.7-inch pOLED Super HD HDR10+ screen with 2,712 x 1,220 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and up to 4,500 nits brightness.</p><p>The screen is also Pantone SkinTone validated to ensure accurate color reproduction. Although Nicholas Sutrich notes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-2025-review" target="_blank">his review of the Motorola Edge 2025</a> that the screen exhibits mura issues and employs color dithering to simulate deeper colors than the panel can actually produce. He finds the supposed higher resolution not worth the trade-off in refresh rate, which is actually higher in the Motorola Edge 2024.</p><p>Finished in soft-touch vegan leather with a slight curve to its design that Sutrich calls “gorgeous,” the phone comes in just one color, Forest Green, which Sutrich describes as “stunning.” The screen is further protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 7, along with an anti-fingerprint coating.</p><p>It’s ultra-durable, sporting both an IP68 and IP69 rating for resistance against dust and water. It also meets MIL-STD-810H standards for protection against things like drops, falls, and bumps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mUXSsTuSWSJfLmTeTcumcN" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-back-03" alt="The vegan leather back of the forest green Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mUXSsTuSWSJfLmTeTcumcN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You only get a single storage option of 256GB along with a 5,200mAh battery, which Motorola says can last for up to two days. If you charge it for just six minutes, you can get up to a full extra day, great for those in a rush who need a quick power boost before walking out the door. The phone supports 68W TurboPower charging (with an optional adapter) and 15W TurboPower wireless charging.</p><p>Equipped with dual speakers that support Dolby Atmos, it has two mics as well. You get only two OS upgrades, and Motorola does not indicate how long the phone will receive security updates. That’s shorter than Motorola’s usual offering of three years of OS updates, a strange change for this device that would only take you into Android 18. It has both fingerprint and face unlock.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4KWxAgEZrjUT7rEfeUNtHU" name="motorola-edge-2024-display-home-pink.jpg" alt="The homescreen of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KWxAgEZrjUT7rEfeUNtHU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By comparison, the Motorola Edge 2024, introduced in June 2024, features a slightly smaller 6.6-inch AMOLED FHD+ screen with a resolution of 2,400 x 1080 and a lower peak brightness of 1,300 nits.

While Sutrich points out that a weak point of the Motorola Edge 2024 was its cameras, he says the issues have been fixed with the Motorola Edge 2025 thanks to not only upgrades to ultrawide and selfie cameras, but also the addition of a telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 has a pro-grade camera system with four cameras, including a 50MP main with wide-angle with Macro Vision, a 50MP rear, a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom and up to 30x Super Zoom, and a 50MP front camera with autofocus, ideal for taking fantastic selfies and group shots.

If you just want to take basic photos for sharing in messages or on social media, it will suffice. But he adds that even launching the camera is slow and feels clunky, with lag between when you try to launch the camera and it’s ready to use. Even photo capture itself is slow with odd shutter lag.</p><p>You won’t be able to take great motion capture pictures either, so if you have kids or pets, forget about this device.

Between the Motorola Edge 2025 vs Edge 2024, which should you choose? Whether you already have the Motorola Edge 2024 or you’re looking to buy new, your best bet is to buy or upgrade to the Motorola Edge 2025. The Motorola Edge 2024 is only supported through this latest OS. So, once Google launches Android 17, you won’t be able to update to it. This means you still have some time, so you can mull it over through the next 12 months if you’re on a tight budget and still unsure.</p><p>What upgrades do you get with the Motorola Edge 2025? To summarize, it features a slightly larger and higher-resolution screen with significantly higher peak brightness. It features an additional camera and improved overall camera capabilities. It has a bigger and purportedly longer-lasting battery. It’s also more durable, with stronger Gorilla Glass on the screen and a higher IP rating. Plus, let’s not forget all the premium AI features that come with this phone.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2024 boasts a stunning design, a faster refresh rate than the Motorola Edge 2025, and a Snapdragon processor versus a MediaTek processor, although, based on Sutrich’s review, this isn’t necessarily a significant advantage. It’s still pretty rugged, has the same amount of RAM and storage, decent battery life with charging at the same rate, and access to limited AI features through Google Photos. But the cameras are a massive step down, and performance is limited.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yt2wVsDKRDW64hLbwPmVm" name="motorola-edge-2024-back-03.jpg" alt="The gorgeous vegan leather back of the Motorola Edge (2024)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yt2wVsDKRDW64hLbwPmVm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thus, the Motorola Edge 2025 is a step up that’s worth taking. With that said, if you’re upgrading, you might be better off looking for an even bigger and better step up. Consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> you can buy right now, and potentially even a different brand. For a tighter budget, look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">the best cheap Android phones</a>. Some of the top phones in a similar price range to the Motorola Edge 2025 are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, both of which outperform this device. You might end up being happier with either of these phones.</p><p>If you are adamant about sticking with Motorola, however, consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">the best Motorola phones</a> for additional alternatives. Interestingly, with this brand, you’ll probably get the best bang for your buck with a foldable phone. Among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phones</a>, Motorola has some high-performing options that make the list, and are a fraction of the cost of competitors.</p><p>Otherwise, if you’re only considering these two devices, either to buy new or upgrade, go with the Motorola Edge 2025. It brings you into the world of AI, bumps up specs with cameras that are miles ahead, and it’s offered at a decent price.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="abece3cd-47bd-49b8-b213-2296120f6636">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LBMcwTEvmFhbHXUbog2FBX.jpg' alt="Motorola Edge 2025"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Motorola Edge 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Not the best Motorola phone you can buy</strong></em></p><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 is better than the Motorola Edge 2024, but it's still not the best Motorola phone, or affordable Android phone for that matter, that you can buy.

They sound much better than I imagined, the connectivity is rock-solid, and they have the best isolation of any product I've used yet. If you're in the Apple ecosystem and want an audio upgrade, this is definitely the way to go.</p><p>I use my AirPods Max with plenty of Android phones too, and they hold up just as well as the Bose QC Ultra or Sony WH-1000XM5. The USB-C model is highly convenient to use as it charges using the same cable as all of my other gear, and a new software update unlocks high-res audio, making the headset that much more versatile. The AirPods Max usually retail for $549, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-Max-Blue/11347872631">they're down to $479 right now</a>, putting them on the same footing as Sony's new WH-1000XM6.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="48d91744-6857-4a5b-b040-a89989cc86db" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The AirPods Max combine an elegant design with amazing sound, and they have excellent noise isolation.

The aluminum chassis is heavier than the plastic-clad Bose and Sony headsets, but it gives the Max better durability, and I didn't see any issues with reliability even after a year of extensive use.</p><p>While it doesn't look like it, the design has much better comfort than I imagined. The memory foam ear pads do a good job even with extended use, and the knit headband is highly breathable. I also like that you get the Max in unique color options — that's just not the case with most headsets in this category.</p><p>What makes the AirPods Max stand out is the sound quality; they have a powerful low-end combined with clean mids and an airy treble, and they do a fantastic job with a diverse set of genres. Also great is the spatial audio mode; there's a noticeable difference to the sound, and the increased soundstage makes music that much more immersive.</p><p>The noise isolation is unmatched; the AirPods Max do an incredible job tuning out ambient noises in the vicinity, and they're much more effective than Sony — something I didn't think was possible. I had no problems using the headset on a 10-hour flight, and battery life is equivalent to Bose and Sony rivals.</p><p>Basically, the AirPods Max are among the best headsets available today, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-Max-Blue/11347872631">discount to $479</a> makes them that much more accessible.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Combined with the node shift to 3nm, the 8 Elite delivered massive gains across the board, and it continues to be one of the fastest mobile platforms available today.</p><p>Qualcomm isn't sitting idly by either — the chip vendor is pushing up the launch of this year's flagship, the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2. That is a big deal in itself, as it allows device makers to launch phones and tablets based on the chipset sooner than ever before. This is what we know about the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2, and when it will make its debut.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2-cpu"><span>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite 2: CPU</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bScw4JoPDKnTFhQdgfAWGB" name="Snapdrag-8-elite" alt="Shot of the stage from Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bScw4JoPDKnTFhQdgfAWGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Qualcomm went back to using custom cores with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and the 8 Elite 2 is set to build on this foundation. It will use a similar design that should see two performance cores alongside six mid-size cores, and it is also likely to be fabricated on the 3nm node.</p><p>What's interesting is that a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5176636804695617">leak out of China</a> details the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2's Geekbench scores, and with a single-core score of over 4,000 and multi-core going over 11,000, it has a significant boost over the 8 Elite. To put that into context, the maximum I got in Geekbench with the Snapdragon 8 Elite is 3,190 in single-core and 9,957 in multi-core results.</p><p>Essentially, Qualcomm is targeting an increase of up to 30% in single-core workloads, and up to 12% in multi-core scenarios. That's a huge deal considering the sheer performance differential between the Snapdragon 8 Elite and 8 Gen 3, and it's exciting to see the chip vendor able to deliver these kind of gains for the second year in a row.</p><p>Of course, these details are based on a leak, so we will need to wait and see how the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 holds up in real-world testing.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2-gaming"><span>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite 2: Gaming</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite is a gaming powerhouse, and it has a significantly higher overhead when it comes to playing demanding titles. I didn't see any issues getting stable framerates even with all the settings turned up, and if anything, the gaming ecosystem on Android is the bottleneck — we need console-quality titles like iOS.</p><p>While we don't know what changes Qualcomm is making to Adreno this year, the one thing I'd like to see is better thermal thresholds. The Snapdragon 8 Elite tends to run hotter than earlier versions, and that means resultant devices overheat even with sizeable thermal management solutions. Qualcomm needs to do a better job setting thermal boundaries on the 8 Elite 2 to ensure this isn't an issue on 2026 flagships.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2-launch-date"><span>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite 2: Launch date</span></h3><p>Qualcomm has confirmed that it is accelerating the launch window of the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2. The chipset will be showcased at the chip vendor's annual Snapdragon Summit, being held on September 23. Qualcomm usually holds its launch event sometime in Q4, with the initial wave of devices featuring its latest chipset debuting in Q1.</p><p>Clearly, it wants to change that dynamic, and by launching the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 early, it will be able to position it better alongside the upcoming A19 — which will also be announced at a similar time.</p><hr><p>While there's plenty we don't know about the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 — including changes to the camera and connectivity — we should get those details over the coming weeks, and I'll update this post accordingly.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Sales of the Galaxy S25 Edge in the phone's first month on the market are "below expectations," according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37255" target="_blank">The Elec</a>.  The low demand for the Galaxy S25 Edge could impact Samsung's plans for the upcoming Galaxy S26 lineup, per the publication.</p><p>The Elec notes that production of the Galaxy S25 Edge "plummeted" compared to last month, which doesn't bode well for the model. As the report explains, the first few months after a smartphone launches usually coincides with consistent mass production. It's unusual for a brand-new smartphone to see its production cut significantly this shortly following its release.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is a controversial smartphone that cut a few corners to hit its impressive 5.8mm thickness. It's the thinnest commercially-available smartphone on the market, but it also has a power-hungry chip and display paired with a measly 3,900mAh battery and slow 25W wired charging speeds. There also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-camera-review">isn't a telephoto camera onboard</a>, and it's the only Galaxy S25 series phone to omit one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yRPgT7JZSbnDWsdgnDvG5Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Thin-Profile-Buttons-16" alt="Left side mmWave antenna and thin profile on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yRPgT7JZSbnDWsdgnDvG5Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rumors pointed to the Galaxy S25 Edge earning a permanent spot in the Samsung Galaxy S lineup next year, phasing out the Plus model. After all, the Galaxy S25 Plus and Edge have the same chip, display, and general form factor — the latter is simply thinner. However, weak demand for this generation could put the company in a predicament.</p><p>Meanwhile, the report claims that Samsung is simultaneously doubling down on production of its upcoming foldables to get ahead of potential U.S. tariffs.</p><p>This report <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-edges-early-sales-seem-to-be-as-slim-as-the-phone-new-report-claims">corroborates another from early June</a> that previewed low demand for the Galaxy S25 Edge. It also seems to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/i-bought-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-but-no-one-else-did">align with negative consumer sentiment</a>, even from Samsung Galaxy fans.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This makes getting back to those moments of emoji brilliance that much easier without recreating the concoction.</p><p>These features under development will likely remain for a little while longer. It'll be worth keeping an eye out for any large Gboard updates in the future. Additionally, the publication states the discovered "SmartEdit" code <em>could be </em>an expansion of what's already available on Android currently. The Google AI ToS (terms of service) mentions could further this suspicion.</p><p>The exclusive Pixel AI feature mentioned for Gboard regards the recently rumored "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-sense-magic-cue-pixel-10-rebrand-rumored">Magic Cue</a>." Previously speculated to be named "Pixel Sense," and "Pixie" before that, Magic Cue is rumored to be intimately involved with all of your personal data should you allow it. In short, Magic Cue will be able to immediately understand a friend asking you for information and see if you have it in Gmail or another connected app.</p><p>Recent rumors state Google tucks this functionality under its "time-saving actions" for the AI assistant. It was stated <em>how </em>the AI could display this information to users, whether it would be its own custom UI or what. However, popping it into Gboard seems like the most logical choice.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A major talking point is what Samsung's version lets users do: customize the "seismic intensity threshold." Users can have one set intensity during the day and another for the night. The company's early development lets users customize its seismic intensity from 1.0 to 4.0, likely based on the Richter Scale for detecting quakes.</p><p>Samsung itself recommends certain numbers, like 2.0 during the day and 3.0 at night, as sudden emergencies during your sleep can pose a severe danger.</p><p>The tipster states that if an earthquake is detected below your set threshold, Samsung's alerts will still produce a notification; however, it won't interrupt what you're doing. When an earthquake is detected, evidence shows users will receive a red "full-screen notification" alongside a warning sound.</p><h2 id="hazardous-situations-2">Hazardous Situations</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung's Earthquake Warnings feature comes with great additions compared to Google's.

Users can discover emergency shelters, access stored medical information, or call their emergency contacts.</p><p>The tipster states this One UI variant is also working on "warning history."</p><p>On the other hand, the publication questions the purpose of Samsung developing its own version, considering Google provides this in its Android OS for all devices. It highlights areas like China, where Google's software isn't prevalent, which could be Samsung's intended audience. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Merc_010/status/1935976240952791192">user on X</a> also mentioned trying to access Google's earthquake alerts before (being in a quake-prone region themselves), but they couldn't as it was a "region-locked" feature.</p><p>This feature seems in line for One UI 8's launch, but there's no clear indication for that, so just keep your eyes open.</p><p>Google's Android earthquake alerts were on our minds recently, as the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/this-one-android-setting-wear-os-earthquakes-early-warning">rolled them out for Wear OS devices</a>. There was nothing inherently new with this update, other than its availability on your smartwatch. Users with these alerts active will see the earthquake's magnitude and their distance from its epicenter. Similar to what Google did for Android, it's bringing these Wear OS quake alerts to "high-risk" areas first.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

However, with the ongoing success of Motorola's Razr series, Samsung has a lot to prove with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>.</p><p>Based on the leaks and rumors about the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 7, we may finally get a phone that gives the Razr a run for its money. So, does that mean you should wait to buy the Z Flip 7, or are you better off going with last year's Flip or even the Razr Ultra? Let's break it down.</p><h2 id="a-cover-screen-worth-using-2">A cover screen worth using?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="45qixYcw9UkSSQ7FVBCmLV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-leaked-render-3" alt="Leaked image of a blue Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/45qixYcw9UkSSQ7FVBCmLV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Alleged render of the Galaxy Z Flip 7. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the most notable upgrades we've seen in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is the updated design, complete with a larger cover screen. From the looks of it, the external display may span the entire top back cover, similar to the layout of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra</a>.</p><p>This is exciting because it should enhance the cover screen experience by giving users more screen real estate to work with. We don't officially know the exact dimensions, but it's rumored to be about 4 inches, which should be plenty of room for activities.</p><p>But most importantly, it should hopefully allow for a better app experience. Currently, Samsung only "officially" allows a select few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">apps on the cover screen</a>, while the rest have to be accessed through a separate panel after installing and setting up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-multistar-button">MultiStar module in Good Lock</a>.</p><p>It's a bit of a process to get it to work, and when it does, apps are confined to the rather limited 3.4-inch display of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, which vertically squishes them down to a nearly unusable size.</p><p>With a larger cover screen, apps should have a little more room to breathe. Furthermore, the expanded cover screen could also hint at a revamped software experience, and hopefully, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/24-hours-using-only-the-motorola-razr-and-galaxy-z-flip-cover-screens">Samsung will follow Motorola's example</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">allow apps to work natively on the cover screen</a>.</p><h2 id="more-power-but-will-it-be-enough-2">More power, but will it be enough?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4031px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EXS9zHrNktqt66hYFcsYGB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-29.jpg" alt="Honkai: Star Rail on the Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EXS9zHrNktqt66hYFcsYGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4031" height="2267" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There have been conflicting rumors about whether or not Samsung will use a Snapdragon or Exynos chip with the Galaxy Z Flip 7. As of late, things seem to be pointing to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-exynos-2500-chip-usage-rumored">Exynos 2500</a> being used in most, if not all, regions, including North America.</p><p>Given the history of Samsung's Exynos chips and consumer sentiment around them, this could put the Galaxy Z Flip 7 at a disadvantage, at least when compared to other flip phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra</a>. After all, it's often the case that Qualcomm chips are generally more powerful than Exynos, although it could be argued that Exynos chips are more efficient.</p><p>Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> have limited space for batteries, this could be a respectable tradeoff, given the phone is expected to arrive with a meager 300mAh bump to battery capacity when compared to the 4,000mAh on the Galaxy Z Flip 6. That's still lower than the 4,700mAh battery of the Razr Ultra, but that may not matter if the chip is more efficient.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="pfyVzktcAoqKdPZy5xx7fc" name="samsung-exynos-chip-generic-hero.jpg" alt="Samsung Exynos chip mockup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pfyVzktcAoqKdPZy5xx7fc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2149" height="1210" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, it seems likely that the chip in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will be more powerful than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> powering the Galaxy Z Flip 6, and it should provide a superior experience. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exynos-2500-processor-cpu-performance-revealed-galaxy-z-flip-7/">Leaked benchmarks</a> indicate that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to achieve single- and multi-core scores of 2,012 and 7,563, respectively. They fall behind other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> devices, but that's likely due to the chip being underclocked to manage thermals in the flip phone chassis.</p><p>In fact, the scores are better than those of the Razr Ultra 2025, which received 1,743 and 6,714. The multi-core score outperforms past Snapdragon chips, but the single-core score lags behind some previous generations. It is possible that Motorola similarly underclocked the prime cores to manage heat, which tends to accumulate at the top half of flip phones.</p><p>Either way, the Razr Ultra performs very well in day-to-day use, and the Galaxy Z Flip 7 should perform similarly, if not better, thanks in part to the rumored (but likely) 12GB of RAM. We just hope Samsung does something about the meager 25W charging speed.</p><h2 id="boring-cameras-exciting-software-2">Boring cameras, exciting software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L3wga9PVH57KmCYYXtjYrm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-06.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3wga9PVH57KmCYYXtjYrm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4197" height="2361" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're hoping for a bump in camera performance, there may not be much in the way of notable upgrades over the Galaxy Z Flip 6.

The new design makes it easier to hold and use, and I like the unique leather texture that's available with the blue color option. The camera housing looks cleaner as well this time, and the best part is that the phone has a bigger 6,000mAh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-talked-to-the-brand-thats-revolutionizing-silicon-battery-tech">silicon battery</a> that easily lasts over a day.</p><p>Combine that with incredible cameras, the best hardware available today, and a vibrant AMOLED with useful additions, and it isn't hard to see why the OnePlus 13 continues to sell so well. I tested the OnePlus 13 for a month when it launched, and went back to the device several times over the course of 2025. I used all iterations of OxygenOS going back to the very first beta build that debuted back in 2015, and I'd like to think I know my way around the skin. So if you're just getting started with the OnePlus 13, here's how I set up my phone.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-the-pull-down-gesture"><span>Set up the pull-down gesture</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rKkATMGpDPeewmQc25WGwm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rKkATMGpDPeewmQc25WGwm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OxygenOS has plenty of annoyances, and one that ranks highly is the global search that shows up instead of the notification pane when you pull down anywhere on the screen. Thankfully, you can switch this back to the notification pane without too much of a hassle.</p><p>Just pull down anywhere after you set up the phone, and you'll get a dialog box asking if you'd like to use global search or access the notification pane. Select the notification pane and hit confirm, and you'll once again access the notification shade with a pull-down gesture.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-switch-back-to-the-classic-notification-shade"><span>Switch back to the classic notification shade</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gnvwGBFhafupjB9UjnTBwm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gnvwGBFhafupjB9UjnTBwm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Talking about the notification shade, OxygenOS recently switched to a split notification pane with the toggles in their own section, and notifications getting a standalone pane. This is similar to iOS, and while other Chinese manufacturers also do this — looking at you, Xiaomi — I'm not a fan of the split shade. I like having notifications and toggles in the same shade, and you can go back to this mode.</p><p>Just head to your phone settings, go to the Notifications & Quick Settings menu, select Quick Settings, and choose the Classic option. Doing so will switch the shade back to a unified style.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-never-miss-a-notification"><span>Never miss a notification</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yLuA7eThbGpBUKAJCGvGwm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yLuA7eThbGpBUKAJCGvGwm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the best things about OxygenOS is the ability to wake screen whenever you get a notification. I like this instead of the always-on mode, as it allows me to view any incoming notifications without worrying about any undue battery use.</p><p>While you're there, you should select enhanced notifications as well; doing so gives you Android's suggested actions, and makes things that much easier.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-make-the-amoled-panel-shine"><span>Make the AMOLED panel shine</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vrEgEJMHJosspSJ3CZ4Fwm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vrEgEJMHJosspSJ3CZ4Fwm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 13 has a vibrant AMOLED panel, and it is set to Natural out of the box. I like the mode; it has good colors without going overboard with the saturation, and if you like better calibration, you can switch to the P3-D65 color gamut by selecting the Pro mode. And if you want vibrant colors with increased saturation, the Vivid mode is the one to choose.</p><p>There's also the option to manually adjust the color balance, so if you like the tonality to be on the warmer or cooler side, you can easily do so.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-mitigate-eye-strain"><span>Mitigate eye strain</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5jo2f9rmMuPpcEB8W3qpxm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5jo2f9rmMuPpcEB8W3qpxm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus uses a BOE panel with 2,160Hz PWM dimming, and it makes a genuine difference if you're switching from an iPhone, Pixel, or Galaxy device. If you're sensitive to PWM dimming, I'd recommend enabling the Ultra anti-flicker mode in the settings.</p><p>There's also a bedtime mode that automatically adjusts colors at night, enabling warmer hues to prevent blue light. I just set it to auto, but if you want a custom tint or schedule, you can easily configure it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-unlock-the-highest-resolution"><span>Unlock the highest resolution</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="47KRE3sEqzntDKW4AxE2xm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/47KRE3sEqzntDKW4AxE2xm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to the last two years, the OnePlus 13 gets a resolution of 3168 x 1440. But to make the most out of the panel, you'll need to go into the settings and change the resolution manually — it's set to Standard (2376 x 1080) out of the box. But once you set it to High, it'll unlock the QHD+ resolution. Doing so uses more battery, so if you want to eke out battery life, I'd suggest toggling the Auto-select mode.</p><p>Similarly, you'll want to change the refresh rate to High to ensure the device enables 120Hz mode wherever possible. Most games are still locked to 60fps, but switching to 120Hz in daily use makes a huge difference.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tailor-the-phone-just-the-way-you-like-it"><span>Tailor the phone just the way you like it</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PT7YZVJLhmmANavhg6vBwm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PT7YZVJLhmmANavhg6vBwm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OxygenOS always exceled at customizability, and that's no different with the OnePlus 13. If anything, you get an even better set of controls this time, including several stunning always-on styles, extensive icon tweaking, ability to change accent colors via Material You dynamic color picker, and so on.</p><p>Basically, you get all the features you need to ensure the device is set up just the way you like, and all of these options are located within the same sub-menu.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-the-home-screen"><span>Set up the home screen</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7LMGQNmiZYS6VdakmBQkwm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7LMGQNmiZYS6VdakmBQkwm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Continuing with customization, the OnePlus 13 lets you adjust the home screen to a decent extent. There's a search pill you can select to show at the bottom — just like on Pixels. You can also set up visual effects, and they make navigating the UI just that bit better.</p><p>There still isn't a way to disable the leftmost pane, and it is set to Google Discover by default — you don't get the option to use anything else. Other than that quibble, I don't have any issues with the home screen as such. OxygenOS does a good job with folders in general, and the ability to launch apps without having to expand a folder is a nice bonus.</p><p>In a similar vein, OnePlus did a thorough job overhauling the UI, and the animations are fluid out of the box. Even so, selecting Enhanced animations makes the interface that little bit smoother.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-adjust-lock-screen-settings"><span>Adjust lock screen settings</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UbM3ZbqbqDj7WjLVtZdSvm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UbM3ZbqbqDj7WjLVtZdSvm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 13 does a good job with lock screen customization as well, and you get the standard raise-to-wake mode. If you use the media player a lot, having it show up on the lock screen is quite useful.</p><p>Similar to iOS and One UI 7, you get the ability to adjust the font, set up widgets, change the sizing of the text, and even add a fluted pattern or liquid glass effects to the background on the lock screen. It is done well, and while I would have liked increased widget selection — you just get the weather and activity count — it's a decent start.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-get-live-alerts"><span>Get live alerts</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="45gZZekfzcgrdpeTDDi5wm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/45gZZekfzcgrdpeTDDi5wm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> is slated to get real-time notification updates in the latter half of 2025, but you don't need to wait until then — the OnePlus 13 has this feature baked in out of the box. Dubbed Live Alerts, the feature allows you to view real-time notifications in the camera cutout area at the front, similar to Dynamic Island on iPhones.</p><p>It is limited to Indian food delivery utilities Swiggy and Zomato, but you get a notification when playing music via Spotify and YouTube Music as well. The built-in music player and other utilities do a good job integrating the feature too, and it is a decent addition.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-make-your-device-theft-proof"><span>Make your device theft-proof</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gBusvsbc9XCPG9rwAgRuwm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gBusvsbc9XCPG9rwAgRuwm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google made plenty of changes to security and privacy in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and the OnePlus 13 includes all of these features. You get a suite of anti-theft features, including theft detection lock and automatically locking your phone when it goes offline. Remote Lock lets you remotely erase data, and you'll need to toggle these features within the Device unlock sub-menu.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-your-phone-never-sounded-this-good"><span>Your phone never sounded this good</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4qhBYzJZ8GFzekGXqYHnwm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4qhBYzJZ8GFzekGXqYHnwm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OxygenOS overhauled its system sounds and ringtones two years ago, and they're quite good now. The ringtones and notification sounds are based on nature, and you get a good range of sounds available. There's also a Holo Sound feature that enables spatial sound, and it makes a difference if you're using earbuds.</p><p>You also get one of the best vibration motors around, and the haptic engine is outstanding — what I like the most is the ability to adjust the feedback. As good as these features are, what's annoying is that DND mode is still flawed; you can mute calls and notifications in one go, but they're not in their distinct categories unlike every other phone.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-extend-battery-longevity"><span>Extend battery longevity</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cHXPYb5xYGeWbvm6jgh2xm" name="OnePlus 13" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cHXPYb5xYGeWbvm6jgh2xm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 13 gets a 6,000mAh silicon battery, and in my use, I easily got over a day without any issues. OxygenOS has built-in tools to extend battery longevity; you can set a charge limit that ensures the battery is only filled to 80%, and the interface has smart charging that estimates charging needs based on your usage habits.</p><hr><p>Ultimately, the OnePlus 13 is a standout phone that highlights just what's possible in this category, and it somehow manages to cost less than Google and Samsung rivals.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="43a69ea6-5974-4050-8568-97ad3a1f4651">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:125.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b5XJzkmqFkF7F8GMJ2RDhE.jpg' alt="oneplus 13 400x500 render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 13</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>OnePlus did all the right things with the OnePlus 13, and six months after its release, it continues to be one of the best phones in the market. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Ray-Ban Meta glasses have already found their groove, so bringing Oakley into the smart eyewear scene feels like a natural next step. Oakley is known for gear that performs, and pairing that with Meta’s tech is a solid way to reach folks who want something that can keep up with their pace.</p><h2 id="oakley-s-entry-into-meta-s-smart-eyewear-ecosystem-2">Oakley's entry into Meta's smart eyewear ecosystem</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iVpUVNkTUVCzfYgwh6XFrK" name="oakley-meta-hstn-official-lifestyle-02" alt="Official lifestyle shots of a person wearing Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iVpUVNkTUVCzfYgwh6XFrK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new specs (no pun intended) are pretty stacked. You get an Ultra HD (3K) camera that lets you film your workouts, tricks, or scenic rides totally hands-free. Built-in open-ear speakers let you blast your hype playlist or catch up on a podcast without getting tangled in wires.</p><p>And of course, it wouldn’t be a Meta collab without AI baked in. You can talk to it mid-activity—ask about the weather, the wind, or tell it to snap a video while you focus on not falling off your board.</p><p>The battery life is surprisingly solid, too. You get 8 hours of active use, 19 hours on standby, and the case adds another 48 hours on top. In a rush? A quick 20-minute charge juices them up to 50%.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div

Speculation suggests the gaming tablet could sport a "simple design." It's unclear what this could allude to, considering OnePlus has changed the design language from the Pad 2 to the Pad 3 (but only regarding its camera cutout).</p><p>More than that, the tipster claims the tablet will sport a screen within the 8-inch range.  It seems OnePlus could provide 3K resolution and deliver a 165Hz refresh rate, which would make games, like Zenless Zone Zero, incredibly smooth to the eye.</p><p>Curiously, users in the comments have started theorizing and questioning when this tablet could debut. There's nothing set in stone, but there's speculation we could see this OnePlus gaming tablet by the year's end or even early 2026.</p><h2 id="oneplus-is-juggling-devices-2">OnePlus is juggling devices</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kRz7rTtnrWGzv5hZDCgsMN" name="Back of OnePlus Pad 3" alt="Back of OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kRz7rTtnrWGzv5hZDCgsMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As far as design goes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> featured a circular camera cutout on its rear panel.

OnePlus placed it into a small vertical container with rounded corners.

I like what Nothing is doing with the software, and utilities like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Essential Space</a> give its phones a distinct advantage.</p><p>Ahead of the July 1 unveil, Nothing is building interest in the device by slowly teasing details, such as the internals and design. The Phone 3 is confirmed to run the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, a 4nm chipset that utilizes the Cortex X4 and A720 cores. While it is a good platform in its own right — Nothing is touting heady gains over the 8+ Gen 1 in the Phone 2 — it isn't the best that Qualcomm has to offer.</p><p>That honor still belongs to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. Having used two dozen phones that feature the chipset, I can say with some confidence that it is faster than just about anything else on Android, and it even holds its own against the A18. Interestingly, Qualcomm went with an all-new custom core design this year, and the switch to the 3nm node means it has better efficiency. You miss out on both upgrades on the 8s Gen 4; it uses regular Cortex cores and is manufactured on a 4nm node.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="TACt38ZS8qetbw73t8mBKQ" name="iqoo-neo-10-1" alt="iQOO Neo 10 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TACt38ZS8qetbw73t8mBKQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 debuted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/iqoo-neo-10-review">iQOO Neo 10</a> last month, and having used it, I came away with the impression that it is a solid choice — for a mid-range device. That's why Nothing's decision to use it on the Phone 3 is puzzling; the manufacturer is clearly positioning the upcoming phone as a flagship, but it isn't including a flagship chipset.</p><p>Nothing is likely going to sell the Phone 3 in the vicinity of $800, and not including the best possible silicon puts the Phone 3 at a disadvantage against all the Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered devices of 2025, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f7-ultra-review">POCO F7 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13</a>. Both the iQOO 13 and POCO F7 Ultra cost significantly less than $800, and with either device available in regions Nothing is targeting (India and the U.K.), I don't see how the Phone 3 can stand out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mNFgGHHBctwRRfRAmW8eSC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro next to Phone 3a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mNFgGHHBctwRRfRAmW8eSC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With such intense rivalry in the high-end segment, any vulnerabilities are going to be magnified, and Nothing's choice to go with the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 could potentially affect the device even before its launch. It isn't just about the cores either; the ISP makes a big difference these days, and with the Phone 3 touted to deliver better cameras, going with Qualcomm's best ISP would have made the device that much stronger.</p><p>And as much as I dislike generative AI features, that's clearly a key point of differentiation with most manufacturers these days, and having the best NPU would've made the Phone 3 stand out. Nothing counts enthusiasts as a key portion of its user base, and it is this audience that cares about the spec sheet more than most.</p><p>Of course, a phone is much more than its specs, and Nothing has shown in the past that it is able to deliver devices with good optimization even without using the best hardware. But I can't help but feel that the brand is being a bit disingenuous by calling the Phone 3 a true flagship — that clearly isn't the case.</p><p>I enjoyed using the Phone 2 when it came out, and the budget Phone 3a and 3a Pro this year. I'm intrigued by what the Phone 3 has to offer; I'll reserve judgement until I use the phone, but I wanted Nothing to deliver a device that's on the same lines as other flagships, and it's annoying that we aren't getting that.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company says it plans for the Magic V5 to continue the legacies left behind by the V2 and V3 devices. As you might've guessed, Honor is staking its claim that the newest phone is the world's thinnest (foldable) device.</p><p>In Honor's keynote at the event, it stated that it has implemented a suite of AI technology features. As such, Honor says these features will drive the Magic V5's capabilities up to near PC-like levels. More information on these features will likely surface a little closer to launch.</p><p>However, Honor is shying away from the market, as it looks at direct competition with Samsung.</p><p>The post calls out Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7, labeling its upcoming Magic V5 as a "compelling alternative." Honor says its foldable leans on "cutting-edge design aspects, performance, and portability."</p><h2 id="human-centric-ai-2">Human-centric AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2640px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:22.73%;"><img id="zaFENeFtZA3uNVHF4V93Wn" name="honor-magic-v5-launch-announcement" alt="The Honor Magic V5 will launch on July 2 in China." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zaFENeFtZA3uNVHF4V93Wn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2640" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we await the Magic V5, Honor's recently started down <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">its Alpha AI path</a>, which saw the company invent ~$10 billion. During MWC in March, Honor announced Alpha AI Plan, a three-step strategy that highlights intelligent phones, AI ecosystem, and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Honor said it wants to facilitate devices with human-centric AI to maximize our potential.</p><p>The intelligent AI software Honor plans for its Magic V5 foldable likely leverages the company's R&D with its Alpha AI Plan.

The idea is to serve up an information-packed lock screen that keeps real-time updates front and center.</p><p>Currently, your Pixel gives you two flavors of At a Glance. There’s the standard version from the Google app, which is the same one you’ll see on plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Then there’s the Pixel-only version baked into the Pixel Launcher, which dishes out smart, context-aware info across various categories.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-gemini-space-leak-3569136/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> could be getting a big At a Glance makeover, possibly rebranded as Gemini Space.</p><h2 id="finance-and-sports-at-your-fingertips-2">Finance and sports, at your fingertips</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3357px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="wuDb9diC8S4fy8FSHuyDHX" name="pixel-6-at-a-glance-widget-lifestyle.jpg" alt="At A Glance widget on Google Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wuDb9diC8S4fy8FSHuyDHX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3357" height="1887" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new version is supposed to go beyond weather and calendar information, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-at-a-glance-widget-could-help-you-follow-sports-scores-on-your-pixel">adding things like live sports scores</a> and finance updates right to your lock screen, making it way more useful at a glance.</p><p>Hints of this new feature first popped up in last month’s Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1, where a system config file called "Ambient Data" was spotted. And since it showed up in both Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 8 Pro firmware, it looks like this upgrade won’t be limited to just the Pixel 10.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:27.70%;"><img id="6zueDkTQ93HQLaXiXtdCbn" name="Gemini-Space-reference-on-a-Pixel-phone" alt="gemini space reference in the Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 release" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6zueDkTQ93HQLaXiXtdCbn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="277" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some extra digging turned up clues about something called an "Ambience Hub."

Digging through its code reveals direct mentions of Gemini Space, along with clear support for showing things like finance recaps and sports updates.</p><p>Interestingly, the Pixel Launcher’s At a Glance widget is supposedly getting those finance recaps and sports updates. Recent code <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/piel-at-a-glance-sports-finance/" target="_blank">spotted</a> in the Android System Intelligence app points to two Pixel-only upgrades in the works—Finance Recap for quick market snapshots and Sports, a long-brewing feature that’s finally getting ready to drop.</p><p>That said, Rahman makes it clear this is still just an informed guess, meaning there’s always a chance Gemini Space ends up being something completely different.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Will the Galaxy Watch 4 receive the stable version eventually, or is it stuck with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>? The answer to that question will be an important one for Wear OS as a whole.</p><p>Samsung has promised "four years of major updates" in press releases since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4</a> launched back in summer 2021 with Wear OS 3.

This December would fall outside the Galaxy Watch 4's four-year window.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CfiRrhScidivGNY8ETyKC7" name="Google-pixel-watch-update-battery-low.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch software update low battery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfiRrhScidivGNY8ETyKC7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Google Pixel Watch 1 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google, meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/12799779?hl=en-NA">promises</a> "at least three years" of updates for its Pixel Watches, "from when the device first became available on the Google Store," which takes the 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch</a> to October 2025.</p><p>Google is speedier than Samsung at delivering version updates to last-gen models, so Wear OS 6 in October is very possible. But Google didn't promise years of "major" updates like Samsung did. It could run out the clock with Watch 1 security updates.</p><p>We can only extrapolate so much from a single Samsung beta software announcement. But later this year, the ambiguity will be cleared up and we'll know exactly how long Wear OS watches stay at the cutting edge of software tricks. And whether they get two, three, or four OS updates, we'll have to decide if that's enough.</p><h2 id="do-wear-os-watches-need-to-live-up-to-apple-watches-for-longevity-2">Do Wear OS watches need to live up to Apple Watches for longevity?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sNLeBpvfqK69BVWAZTF4dC" name="Apple-Watch-Series-6-apps" alt="The Apple Watch Series 6 sitting above a felt floor with colorful blocks surrounding it, the display showing a collection of app icons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sNLeBpvfqK69BVWAZTF4dC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Apple Watch Series 6 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Later this year, the 2020 Apple Watch Series 6 will get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/watchos-26-wear-os-6-are-taking-different-approaches-to-same-problems">watchOS 26</a>. That should be the final major update, though Apple may offer the occasional major security patch. So how should 2021 Galaxy Watch 4 or 2022 Pixel Watch buyers feel?</p><p>Apple's unspoken five-year commitment to watches is rare. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> are known for their longevity, but new features usually taper off after one or two years — and some fitness watches are stuck with the features advertised at launch.</p><p>As with its phones, Apple produces its watch silicon, making it easier to design features to work across generations because it controls the architecture. But since Samsung makes its own Exynos chips for Galaxy Watches, you'd think they'd get the same benefits.</p><p>Considering you can buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-affordable-galaxy-a16-5g-just-dropped-and-yet-its-already-17-percent-off-at-amazon">Galaxy A16 5G</a> for $100 less than a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and get six years of OS updates, it's not a matter of watches being too cheap to <em>deserve</em> support.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ssfNhouhvEsjaRSbqHv6LQ" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-march-2025-update" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting on a bookshelf, showing the update screen: "Your watch is up to date; Android version: 15; Android security update: March 5, 2025"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ssfNhouhvEsjaRSbqHv6LQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even a cheap phone will have 3–4X the RAM and three or four more ARM Cortex cores than your typical smartwatch SoC. Samsung has more headroom and better thermal solutions with the A16 than a Galaxy Watch optimized for max battery life. And any new Wear OS feature added could imbalance the entire system.</p><p>Just in the past year, we've seen how Google had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-problems-force-pause">roll back Wear OS 5</a> and then fix major bugs with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/delayed-wear-os-5-1-update-mess-has-me-annoyed-and-looking-for-solutions">Wear OS 5.1</a>. Google <em>wants</em> to refresh its watches with new features at a quarterly cadence, but has trouble executing.</p><p>Maybe once Qualcomm delivers its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new Snapdragon Wear chip</a> or Pixel Watches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/upcoming-pixel-watches-could-play-it-safe-and-i-dont-like-it">switch to RISC-V</a>, they'll have the capacity to last longer. Plus, cutting off the Pixel Watch's 2018 Exynos 9110 chip frees Google to get more ambitious with Wear OS 6, making new buyers happier but leaving original customers in the lurch.</p><h2 id="do-you-care-how-long-your-wear-os-watch-lasts-2">Do you care how long your Wear OS watch lasts?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PSFP25dcjLkVNy75gBUkjJ" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-colorful-watch-faces" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting beside the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra on a brown table, both with colorful watch faces." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PSFP25dcjLkVNy75gBUkjJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a full spectrum of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> in terms of software support. Mobvoi watches are still on Wear OS 4 and lack Google Assistant; OnePlus promises two OS updates and three years of security, but takes a year longer than Google to deliver to last-gen watches; and then there's Google and Samsung leading the charge.</p><p>Frankly, any smartwatch from 2022 or earlier will have significant downgrades from current models in terms of display quality, health sensors, and performance speed. So should customers be <em>expected</em> to upgrade so that Samsung and Google can evolve past old tech, or should they <em>expect</em> the right to get new features for four years?</p><p>As someone who usually gets the latest watch tech every year, I'm spoiled with instant access to new features, and therefore expect them. So I'm curious how much you (the reader) care about these updates.</p><p>Would you be upset if your Galaxy Watch 4 couldn't access Vascular Load, Running Coach, Antioxidant Index, and other tools from One UI 8 Watch? Or if your Pixel Watch 1 didn't get Material 3 Expressive, third-party watch face apps, dynamic theming, and battery optimizations from Wear OS 6?</p><p>Or are you okay with the expectation that you'll need to upgrade to a new watch every 2–3 years for major UI upgrades or Gemini?</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to Pak, the Korean OEM is reportedly planning on "exploring" premium subscription models for "advanced coaching features."</p><p>This all stems from Samsung's new outlook toward our health and how we can stay on top of it, regardless of how busy life gets. Pak told the publication, "There's illness, there's cancer, and so many other conditions that are actually preventable." Pak adds, "...our mission is to meet people where they are and help support those healthy behaviors in a meaningful way."</p><p>Moreover, Pak stated the features Samsung is working on with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watches</a> and its health software are designed to "really contextualize it (nutrition, stress, etc.) for the user."</p><p>It's unclear just how much these subscription models could cost users, especially without knowing if Samsung will offer multiple tiers, too. However, if Samsung decides to go forward with this, we might hear something later this summer.</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-watch-advances-health-2">One UI 8 Watch advances Health</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="brT4uihzszeAu99JDP24yQ" name="One-UI-8-Vascular-Load" alt="One UI 8 Watch health features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/brT4uihzszeAu99JDP24yQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We'd be lying if we said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/i-think-samsung-health-likely-to-get-ai-subscription-soon">we didn't see this coming</a>.

Like its other Galaxy AI features, Samsung has touted them as being "free for now," and it seems it could shift its Health features into a monetization scope.</p><p>During Pak's interview with CNET, he mentioned a host of features Samsung is developing, namely those we've seen confirmed for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/samsung-announces-one-ui-8-watch-beta-program">One UI 8 Watch beta</a>.

Instead, what consumers will find on the Phone 3 will be Nothing's new Glyph Matrix lighting system, which it's confirming again today; however, it comes with more insight. From the clip shared, it seems Nothing is implementing its new lighting system on the top right corner of the device's back.</p><p>The clip shows the matrix system working with a strobbing design effect.</p><p>Nothing's tagline reads, "When light becomes language." While its teaser only shows a cool design, it's possible this matrix system will offer information without looking at your screen. There's a chance we could see some of the Glyph Lighting's previous functions, about order progress and more, slide into the new Matrix when it launches.</p><h2 id="nothing-s-wants-a-flagship-2">Nothing's wants a flagship</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When light becomes language.Introducing the Glyph Matrix.Phone (3). 1 July. pic.twitter.com/YtlPDIlMO6<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1935669481906266282">June 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Nothing first teased that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-is-giving-up-the-one-thing-that-sets-its-phones-apart">was moving away</a> from the Glyph Lighting array at the end of May. It said, "We killed the Glyph Interface" with some theatrics sprinkled in for good measure. The Glyph lights gave Nothing's phones some uniqueness, but also took their interactions to another level when flipped over. Its phone had a feature called "Flip to Glyph," where users could turn the device face down and only receive "notifications" via the interface.</p><p>The lights also doubled as a timer, so you could keep track without the screen, as well as serving as an indicator for its charging status.</p><p>Now, the matrix design Nothing is going for reminds us of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS ROG Phone 9</a>.

Typically helmed by Android Central Senior Editor Nicholas Sutrich, this week's entry is a guest post from Michael Hicks, another Android Central Senior Editor who regularly covers all things XR.</p></div></div><p>After a week at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-of-awe-2025-coolest-xr-demos-niantic-viture-sony-android-xr">Augmented World Expo 2025</a>, writing about cool prototypes and lofty promises about XR's future, I've hijacked Nick Sutrich's weekly VR column to hype up the one thing from AWE that I'm excited about <strong>right now</strong>: gaming and streaming on AR glasses.</p><p>Google and Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-google-described-conflicting-visions-of-ar-glasses-future-at-awe-2025">described their visions for AR glasses at AWE</a>, promising all-day AI companions and stylish form factors. But even Meta admitted they likely won't break into the mainstream until the 2030s.</p><p>If we're talking about AR glasses designed for at-home use that don't need to "blend in," those are available now. However, every pair I've tested so far has felt imperfect compared to setting up shop in front of a TV or monitor.</p><p>After my AWE 2025 demos with Viture and XREAL glasses — both current models and unreleased future versions — I'm convinced that the XR display market is ready to explode, sooner rather than later.</p><h2 id="ar-gaming-glasses-are-getting-better-2">AR gaming glasses are getting better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZhaXFyYLWHmvD2T4dHbuRW" name="xreal-one-vs-xreal-air-2-inside" alt="Comparing Xreal One (top) and Xreal Air 2 (bottom) birdbath lens shape and size" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZhaXFyYLWHmvD2T4dHbuRW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My colleagues have reviewed and loved AR gaming displays like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">XREAL One</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rayneo-air-3s-review">RayNeo Air 3S</a>. However, when Nick sent me his XREAL Air 2s last year, I enjoyed the novelty but found them to be fairly unengaging.</p><p>I appreciated how light they were compared to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> for XR content. Plugging them into my Steam Deck and getting an instant AR display for gaming felt awesome, and it helped me avoid my terrible gamer posture by leaning back with my console in my lap.</p><p>That didn't eliminate my usual complaints with XR glasses I've tried at conventions: the 46º field of view (FoV), FHD resolution, and 500 nits of brightness all add up to a <em>normal</em> viewing experience, not a transformative one.</p><p>XREAL advertises a 130-inch display experience on the Air 2, but in my experience, it feels closer to a large gaming monitor or a mid-sized TV with a fast refresh rate, but pedestrian visuals, and more eye strain. They're great for travel, but I'm too much of a homebody for this use case to apply often.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fUGWMwbPWqgZjAFYJzSonh" name="xreal-one-pro-with-xreal-eye-03" alt="Xreal One Pro smart glasses with an Xreal Eye camera attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fUGWMwbPWqgZjAFYJzSonh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, at AWE 2025, I had the opportunity to try out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-pro-and-xreal-eye-deliver-a-new-vision-for-smart-glasses">XREAL One Pro glasses</a> at their booth. I'd <em>hoped</em> for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye">Project Aura</a> demo, but the Pros were a wonderful silver lining with their 57-degree display and boosted brightness.</p><p>Driving around the world of Forza Horizon 4 with the Pros and a handheld console, I felt much more immersed than before. My Air 2 display at home feels like a shiny postage stamp stuck in my visual center, while the wider Pro display hugs the edge of my vision compellingly.</p><p>With its 3DoF support, I can anchor the display, making it easier to look away from the game to talk to someone or check my phone, or else angle the display if I want to look slightly up or down. That kind of flexibility makes me more likely to want to wear them, without feeling as closed off from my surroundings as I do in VR.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="UY6JMGaMWwdDfZUYSuKGed" name="Viture-XR-Pro-Glasses-and-Switch-2" alt="The Nintendo Switch 2 sitting on a table with Viture Pro XR glasses sitting above it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UY6JMGaMWwdDfZUYSuKGed.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I also tried Viture's next-generation AR glasses at AWE 2025, including one display so experimental that it wasn't even attached to glasses yet. Viture doesn't want me giving any specifics yet (except to "tease" readers), but it's no secret that they turned my skeptical perspective on AR displays into excitement.</p><p>Viture's current Pros also measure 46 degrees with FHD resolution, but I appreciate the straightforward "myopia adjustment" slider on top to solve for my left eye's nearsightedness. That way, I don't need to commit to a specific prescription, then have my eyes get worse a year or two from now; plus, it doesn't lock out my fiancée or anyone else from using them.</p><p>Without specifics, Viture's next-gen glasses make significant improvements in areas like FoV and display quality, which make them feel <em>worth</em> the 80g of weight resting on my nose and ears. And other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> brands are likely to keep pace, making them more competitive as true TV or monitor replacements.</p><h2 id="still-a-ways-to-go-for-ar-displays-but-we-re-close-2">Still a ways to go for AR displays, but we're close</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LmiiiuySmpF65CQAGJvuoK" name="RayNeo Air 3S" alt="RayNeo Air 3S review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LmiiiuySmpF65CQAGJvuoK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At AWE 2025, XREAL's Ralph Jodice talked about the pressure from customers to "make my FoV wider, make my glasses smaller." Right now, brands like XREAL, Viture, Rokid, and RayNeo are racing to offer better visuals for power users, but that comes with comfort trade-offs. I'd eventually want AR glasses that are lighter than my Air 2s but with the visual quality of the heavier Pros.</p><p>As I noted before, anchored displays will benefit any gaming glasses, but that requires camera support. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-pro-and-xreal-eye-deliver-a-new-vision-for-smart-glasses">Xreal Eye</a> solves this, and future glasses may have that camera built in from the get-go.</p><p>But that, combined with brighter, high-res displays, could make AR glasses a major battery drain on your phone or console, especially since they require the USB-C port you'd normally use for charging during long gaming sessions. So efficiency will be important, on top of comfort.</p><p>Next, aside from myopia correction, AR glasses need to do more to accommodate different interpupillary distances (IPD), so you're not straining or cross-eyed using them. Rokid just announced that its new AR Spatial glasses pack will add software IPD adjustments to target 53mm to 75mm, which sounds promising.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jgoHnWH37mMftq7oY5jhDi" name="xreal-one-lenses-inside-02" alt="Xreal One smart display glasses showing a Windows desktop on its displays" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jgoHnWH37mMftq7oY5jhDi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All together, AR glasses will remain a niche category while companies figure out these fundamental issues. However, the visual upgrades will be impressive enough that more people will be willing to live with the trade-offs. They just need a chance to break out of the tech niche.</p><p>I suspect that will happen as we see more non-AR glasses in store displays, like the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-smart-glasses-teaser">Oakley Meta glasses</a>. Best Buy or Target could group some AR glasses in the same category, letting people try out these 100-inch AR displays and decide whether they want to spend thousands more on an OLED TV.</p><p>We may still be years off from AR glasses becoming "mainstream," but the tech in these devices is reaching the point that they're starting to live up to AR's potential. I, for one, will actually start to enjoy using them.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to Akis Evangelidis, the Nothing Phone 3 will allegedly provide consumers with five years of Android OS updates and seven years of security updates.</p><p>What's unclear early on is how often these security updates will arrive for users. Nothing's Phone 2 experienced bi-monthly updates, and it seems it's doing the same for the latest 3a series. Considering Nothing's really pushing the "flagship" status of the Phone 3, it would be nice to see security updates every month, but we'll have to see what happens.</p><p>Moreover, the extended duration of major Android OS upgrades, which should take consumers into 2030 before that's done with. This is a major shift from the Phone 2's three-year Android OS promise (with four years of security updates). This isn't <em>quite </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">seven years like Samsung</a>, but it's better than before.</p><h2 id="the-nothing-flagship-2">The Nothing Flagship</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">8 Gen 3 has a weaker GPU, NPU, connectivity and ISP - and default software support is 4 & 4.

The chip is said to bring an 88% increase in GPU, a 33% increase in CPU power, and a 125% boost in its NPU.</p><p>Just yesterday (June 17), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-grabs-snapdragon-8s-gen-4-for-its-upcoming-flagship-phone-3">Nothing confirmed</a> that the Phone 3 will rock Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 SoC. The company's CEO, Carl Pei, followed this up in a YouTube video, stating the Phone 3 will essentially blow its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a>, out of the water. Not only are the phone's cameras said to see a wild boost, but its performance should step it up considerably, as well.</p><p>In practice, Pei said the Phone 3 should feel a lot "snappier" when in use. Some users may wonder why Nothing is opting for the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead of something else. Pei states he wanted to give users a "balanced experience" with a chip that could handle everything had "gotten better" inside the Phone 3.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 (and the Headphone 1) are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-sets-a-date-for-its-phone-3-launch-and-its-not-too-far-away">set to debut</a> on July 1 in London.

Both products help complete the Xreal One product line and deliver a fuller vision of what we can expect from the company in the future.</p><p>Earlier this year, Xreal debuted its next-generation smart display glasses, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a>, which debuted the first-ever on-glasses chip that enables 3DoF tracking with no additional software or configuration. Meanwhile, the tiny new Xreal Eye camera upgrades this tracking to 6DoF, or the equivalent of what a VR headset like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> can deliver. In short, that means you can walk around, and your floating virtual monitor stays in place.</p><p>Xreal One Pro, on the other hand, is a new upgraded set of glasses that runs roughly $100 more than Xreal One. Upgrading gets you a newer Sony micro-OLED that's 100 nits brighter, a notably thinner prism display that eliminates the glare of birdbath optics, a 7-degree larger field of view (FoV), and a new interchangeable frame for an added style bonus.</p><h2 id="price-and-availability-2">Price and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Hp9PaJpyTanmT9ZWcSvFLA" name="xreal-eye-in-box" alt="The Xreal Eye camera in its box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hp9PaJpyTanmT9ZWcSvFLA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal Eye retails for $99 and requires a pair of Xreal One or Xreal One Pro glasses to work.

Physical stores should start carrying Xreal Eye later in July.</p><p>Xreal One Pro starts at $599/€649/£549 for preorder customers, but pricing rises to $649/€689/£579 as of retail availability on July 1. Customers can still get the early bird pricing by ordering before June 30 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-one-pro">at xreal.com</a>.

Xreal Eye might seem like a superfluous add-on at first, but its modular design solves a real problem in a great way. If someone around you doesn't like the camera on your glasses, you can simply <em>remove it</em>.</p><p>Installation is as simple as possible. Remove the rubber covering from the underside of the glasses' nose bridge, then slide the camera in. It'll automatically recognize the camera, although you may need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xreal.com/support/update/">update your glasses' firmware</a> to get all the nifty new features.</p><p>Xreal Eye enables enhanced spatial anchor functionality, which means that the floating virtual monitor it normally displays does an even better job of staying in place. With the default 3DoF tracking, Xreal One and Xreal One Pro allow you to turn your head and move in place a bit, but moving back and forth or getting up and walking around while wearing the glasses will result in the display changing position.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L4oVdyvD6KUot5TRSZnAKA" name="xreal-eye-installed-on-xreal-one-glasses-01" alt="The Xreal Eye camera installed in a pair of Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L4oVdyvD6KUot5TRSZnAKA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jWxiRJjUMyQ3WqwuQi5CKA" name="xreal-eye-installation" alt="Installing the Xreal Eye camera in a pair of Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jWxiRJjUMyQ3WqwuQi5CKA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dMUkyM7tP7gwSJkz4NyHnh" name="xreal-one-pro-with-xreal-eye-02" alt="Xreal One Pro smart glasses with an Xreal Eye camera attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dMUkyM7tP7gwSJkz4NyHnh.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>With Xreal Eye, that virtual screen stays put even if you get up and walk around.

While they're a few grams heavier, Xreal One Pro is the first pair of smart display glasses I've used with a prism lens system. This new prism lens is notably smaller than any pair of glasses that use birdbath optics, which is to say, every other commercially available pair on the market.</p><p>This means the glasses sit slightly closer to your face and are physically more compact, as well. You can see the difference from the case alone, which is a bit smaller than the one that ships with Xreal One.</p><p>Holding the glasses up next to each other makes the difference incredibly noticeable. The entire top portion of the glasses is significantly shallower and smaller, and the optics themselves are completely flat inside the frame, while birdbath optics sit at a downward angle.</p><div

positive side effect this flat design has is glare reduction. I'm sitting poolside wearing the glasses while working on my laptop, sun blaring around the umbrella I'm sitting under. Not only is it easy to see the display — it's plenty bright and the electrochromic film adds a layer of tinting to offset the light — but there's no reflection from the bright pavement below me.</p><p>Reflection is one of the biggest issues people have had with birdbath optics, particularly if you wear lighter clothing, so this is a great fix. I also feel like the prism lens helps even out the extreme brightness from the display. Bright whites at max brightness on Xreal One can almost be painful at times, but they're more evened out and less extreme on Xreal One Pro.</p><p>Xreal says the FoV on these glasses is seven degrees larger than Xreal One, but I have a hard time spotting this. If anything, it seems like Xreal One Pro's prism lenses are slightly wider than Xreal One, which is likely where the difference comes in. Plus, there's no lens distortion at the edges of the frame anymore. It's more of a gradual fade as the image tapers off the side.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:88.87%;"><img id="5M7Gd2bzbkYhAx7hf5qreP" name="xreal-one-vs-xreal-one-pro-glasses-distance" alt="Comparing the depth of Xreal One and Xreal One Pro glasses while wearing them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5M7Gd2bzbkYhAx7hf5qreP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1820" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the physical changes, Xreal One Pro is just as easy to use as Xreal One.

It's a huge step in the right direction for a company that has been full of nothing but wins lately, and gives us an idea of what to expect from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye">Xreal Project Aura</a> when it launches with Android XR, likely sometime early next year.</p><p>For now, though, Xreal One Pro outfitted with Xreal Eye is the best smart display glasses combination you can buy.

But didn't reveal much about where the event is slated to take place. Considering earlier rumors suggested that Samsung could be launching its next foldable line-up in<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york"> New York after three years. </a></p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The next Galaxy Unpacked: 9 July 2025 @ 10AM EDT<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1935396700908409256">June 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>That said, the Korean OEM is expected to launch the next set of foldables: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Z Flip 7</a> during the event. Speaking of foldables, Samsung has been heavily <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-teases-ai-camera-with-situational-awareness-for-galaxy-z-fold-7-ultra">teasing</a> a supposed "ultra-thin" foldable that could launch during this Galaxy Unpacked. While it may not hold the Ultra in its name, Samsung could be promising an Ultra-like experience with the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>As of now, all we know is that Samsung is calling this device "The next chapter of Ultra." It said that the Ultra experience goes beyond just feature upgrades, but will also customize the form factor of the device, making it smaller and more easily portable. Hinting at the device's cameras, the company said it will have a new intelligent camera system that can be more intuitive and understand what users are shooting and adjust itself to match any situation.</p><p>“As AI evolves from text-based prompts to multimodal understanding, Galaxy devices are becoming smarter — able to get what you’re looking at and respond to situations. The camera is at the heart of this transformation,” the company explained.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.00%;"><img id="NZvkbMmCcn8auY8NrtoDui" name="Galaxy-Z-Fold-7-teaser-02" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NZvkbMmCcn8auY8NrtoDui.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Several rumors also suggest that  Samsung will drop its newest wearables lineup, aka the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 series</a>,  which will allegedly show up as a trio this year, comprising the Galaxy Watch 8, Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, and Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025).</p><p>Furthermore, a Korean news site suggested earlier today (June 18) that Samsung could also drop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsungs-xr-headset-could-finally-launch-in-september">teasers of its first-ever XR headset</a>, also called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>, that was showcased recently at Google I/O.</p><p>Last year, Samsung unveiled its foldable phones in Paris on July 10th, and we anticipate this year's event could follow a similar timeline.

Whether or not that&apos;s a dealbreaker is up to you, but if you just want a cheap, great-looking phone today, the Edge Plus (2023) is an outstanding pick. </p> ]]></dc:content>

To Mohan, bringing Veo 3 into the fold will "open new creative lanes" for new and existing content creators.</p><p>According to Mohan, YouTube plans to properly incorporate Google's Veo 3 model into its Short environment "later this summer."</p><p>It seems YouTube is placing a lot of focus on its creators, considering the use cases for Veo 3. Not only did Mohan claim "the possibilities with AI are limitless," but he states, "creators will flip formats, blend genres, and push deeper into the mainstream."</p><p>YouTube feels that AI tools for video can help usher its creators' creativity into a new era.

The feature seems to have been spotted in the Google app bearing version <strong>16.23.69</strong>. And, it is said to be on a gradual rollout for now, and users are expected to be getting it soon.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/uMwpOrkyEhA">video shared</a> by the publication, videos from your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> up to five minutes in length can be uploaded to the Gemini AI assistant for it to analyze what's in the video. Here, a selected video can be of five minutes, or users can upload multiple videos, but the run time should be five minutes (combined).<br><br>To try the feature, users need to hit the "plus" button in the Gemini text box and upload a video from their gallery/ files, provided the feature is available for the handset first. Gemini would then generate an analysis of the video(s) and further elaborate with relevant pointers as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="QuXz39BTyfPJxh5hxZEJYE" name="google-gemini-video-analysis" alt="Google Gemini with video analysis feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QuXz39BTyfPJxh5hxZEJYE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The said feature is currently limited to file upload onto the Gemini AI assistant; however, in future releases, users can expect it to work right from the camera video recording when users hit the camera icon, instead of selecting gallery/ files for existing video upload.</p><h2 id="handy-new-way-to-get-summaries-2">Handy new way to get summaries</h2><p>The latest addition, similar to what ChatGPT had for a while, is a welcoming feature for Gemini through the Google app. It can help users to summarize what's in the video they shot or received on their phone.</p><p>It can be beneficial to students, assuming they video record their classes or see a demonstration of something important, like an equipment functionality, and get a quick summary of it later on their phones with the help of Gemini. We also expect that the AI assistant should soon be able to remove the five-minute threshold of the video in the near future after a broader rollout.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The company highlighted the device in a press release, adding that the band can run for seven nights on a single full charge. Garmin's vice president of consumer sales and marketing, Susan Lyman, said, "Wearing this smart sleep band every night can provide in-depth sleep insights and a more complete picture of fitness and recovery."</p><p>Users will find similar functions with the smart band as they would with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>. The post highlights the band's ability to capture your sleep data, such as sleep stages (light, deep, REM) and HRV status. The next morning, Garmin says your Index Sleep Monitor will upload its sleep data to provide you with a Sleep Score, ranging between zero and 100.</p><p>Sleep functions continue with Pulse Ox. Garmin says the sleep band can even track and calculate your blood oxygen saturation throughout the night.</p><p>Moreover, the company worked in Breathing variations and Respiration data. The former partners with Pulse Ox, so users can "better understand shifts in breathing patterns." The latter gives you information on any changes in your breathing rates while you were sleeping.</p><h2 id="garmin-s-health-focus-evolves-2">Garmin's Health-focus Evolves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:910px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.93%;"><img id="ykYZkopFQQehSB7uKSRj8S" name="garmin-index-sleep-monitor-band-example" alt="A model is wearing the Garmin Index Sleep Monitor on her right arm while she sleeps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ykYZkopFQQehSB7uKSRj8S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="910" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another major part of this Garmin smart sleep band is its tracking capabilities for women's health. Garmin states the Index Sleep Monitor will leverage a woman's skin temperature to provide insightful menstrual cycle estimations and information. Additionally, the device can help women keep track of their pregnancy, as well as provide exercise and nutrition assistance.</p><p>Aside from menstrual tracking, the sleep band's skin temperature readings can assist users with early signs of "potential illness" and other changes to their sleep environment that might've affected them.</p><p>Stress tracking throughout the night is available, and "Body Battery energy monitoring." With this, Garmin says the band will inform the wearer if they should take the day easier, meaning get some more rest. Garmin recommends wearing one of its compatible smartwatches, which will further the Body Battery feature to give you a "complete" picture of whether you should push yourself or take it easy.</p><p>The Garmin Index Sleep Monitor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/1650098/">is available now</a> for $169.99 in Small and Medium, as well as Large and Extra Large sizes.

But even though Google didn't "announce" anything at AWE, I learned a lot about its strategy to rely on partners like Samsung, Qualcomm, and Unity to court skeptical developers.</p><p>Here's every tidbit I gleaned from my AWE 2025 event about Android XR!</p><h2 id="an-android-xr-recruiting-blitz-for-devs-2">An Android XR recruiting blitz for devs</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lowVrEFOsV4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>"Google has been working in the glasses space for 10 years, and we have not stopped." Google has been using that line since it announced Android XR last year, and Payne brought it out again at AWE. Google <em>really</em> wants to reassure us that the deaths of Google Glass and Daydream were exaggerated and that Android XR won't end up in the Graveyard.</p><p>Payne, who leads Google's XR product management team, said that despite "massive strides forward in both hardware and software," the true "inflection point" for XR has been the rise of multimodal AI and LLMs. They're pushing Gemini as the glue across all VR/AR headsets and smart glasses, and reassuring developers that they can access Gemini to simplify their own XR apps.</p><p>"AI will do for XR products what the touchscreen did for smartphones," Payne argued. And since devs can access the Gemini API through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/ai-logic/get-started?api=dev">Firebase AI Logic SDK</a>, they may be tempted to join Android XR and experiment with multimodal AI for their apps.</p><p>You can currently only code Android XR apps for VR headsets like Moohan, but Google will open up software for smart glasses "later this year," and it's also working with Samsung and glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-can-make-smart-glasses-accessible-with-warby-parker-gentle-monster-deals">designers like Warby Parker</a> to "ship the first set of smart glasses soon."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3RKYVmC39UzAdraZPJ8DFZ" name="Android-XR-AWE-2025-perception-stack" alt="Google's Hugo Swart on stage at AWE 2025 discussing Android XR's "Powerful Perception Stack."

Devs can create one app with one SDK that'll port to headsets and glasses, saving them development time.</p><p>Plus, Google is "deeply integrating and optimizing our code to Snapdragon," so that Android XR works natively on chips like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomms-new-on-device-ai-chip-could-change-smart-glasses-forever">Snapdragon AR1+</a> that support on-device AI for smart glasses.

And according to Google project manager Ryan Bartley, you can work in-headset to update your XR game, "iterating on your work in seconds with changes from the Unity Editor appearing instantly on your headset." That sounds pretty handy!</p><p>Features like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-headsets-will-take-vital-camera-option-from-android-phones">passthrough API</a>, plane detection, and hand tracking are all demonstrated through Unity packages, or "showcase samples," so that devs can apply the source code to their own games. And anyone who used the Snapdragon Spaces SDK for past XR experiences can migrate to Android XR using the compatibility plugin.</p><p>That is to say, many current VR experiences should be <em>capable</em> of a quick Android XR transition, though Unreal Engine games won't have as easy a conversion process.</p><p>I also learned that Google has held "four Android XR developer boot camps across the globe." Some Quest devs have complained about Google excluding them, so I'm curious if Google (or Samsung) will expand these boot camps or leave smaller devs to rely on Unity.</p><h2 id="counting-on-devs-to-join-android-xr-now-and-profit-later-2">Counting on devs to join Android XR now and profit later</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ANM8YCS6pxDxDmdeejhNy8" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-7" alt="Michael Hicks wearing Android XR prototype glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ANM8YCS6pxDxDmdeejhNy8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I attended several panels about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-google-described-conflicting-visions-of-ar-glasses-future-at-awe-2025">future of AR glasses at AWE</a> with Google and Meta execs, and Google's team is counting on devs being tempted by their open system and easy transition.</p><p>XREAL's Ralph Jodice said that anyone coding for Android XR now can be on their Project Aura headset right now, "and you should be." The idea is that devs' familiarity with Android will make the transition to Android XR easy, and once you optimize your app, it'll work across the entire "ecosystem" of devices as they arrive.</p><p>That said, Google needs to assure devs that they'll get a return on investment. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-will-never-recover-from-its-stadia-debacle">Killing Stadia</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-daydream-vr-platform-finally-and-fully-dead">Daydream</a>, Cardboard, and other services <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/android-xr-will-be-another-doa-google-product">has given Google a reputation</a>, which is why Swart promised during his panel that Google is "committed to investing in the ecosystem."

As open as Android XR is, devs need assurances that enough people will buy their apps to make the transition worth it.</p><p>Meta's Kelly Ingham made that point during her smart glasses panel: their smart glasses system isn't open to people yet, but their "focus" is to "get as many devices in the market as we can" so devs can "develop an app and actually make money." It felt like a subtle jab at Android XR.</p><p>Swart promised that future Qualcomm reference devices for Android XR will be tailored "to a variety of use cases and price points" so ODMs can "balance visual quality and price." So perhaps we'll see an influx of affordable Android XR devices that go beyond elite productivity headsets.</p><p>Until then, it's hard to say whether VR and XR devs will buy into Android XR's open-platform promise or wait for more concrete hardware from Google's partners.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Allegedly, judging by the listing, we're to expect a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 XL, and a Pixel 10 Pro Fold again this year. These cases sold out rather quickly on their main website. Thinborne advertised its cases as "Super Thin" with MagSafe technology.</p><p>These cases make it seem like we're seeing the same Pixel design as the 9 series; however, a closer look suggests there could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-leaks-in-all-angles-ahead-of-alleged-august-launch">be some slight variations</a> with the 10. Thinborne's cases feature a larger cutout at the top left-hand side, which could be for the Pixel 10's SIM slot, as we've seen rumored before. Even the bottom features three cutouts, one for its USB-C slot and two for its (alleged) shifted speakers.</p><p>While some cases can feel a little clunky, Thinborne states these Super Thin cases feature their "thinnest," minimalistic design. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thinborne.com/">Thinborne</a> also touts the grip on these thin cases that will hopefully keep you away from heartbreaking drops.</p><p>The inclusion of MagSafe technology on the case itself means users can enjoy wireless charging capabilities, if we're to expect this same range of devices for the Pixel 10 series.</p><h2 id="the-pixel-10-series-sticks-with-four-2">The Pixel 10 series sticks with four?</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gYiXLPTrNGVz6JHeUiJia4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-01" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gYiXLPTrNGVz6JHeUiJia4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="it8BfEhLyB8v2zQDuLBwZ4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-04" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/it8BfEhLyB8v2zQDuLBwZ4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eXJfnQhh6LKugaLK2NPwZ4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-05" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eXJfnQhh6LKugaLK2NPwZ4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vzmsv6RCWRCs84tiwVdob4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-03" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vzmsv6RCWRCs84tiwVdob4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Nothing is confirmed yet (of course), but it seems Thinborne is playing off a number of Pixel 10 rumors that suggested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">we'd see the same four phones</a> in 2025. Last September, an early Pixel 10 rumor claimed Google had already started development for the new series with the following codenames: Frankel, Blazer, Mustang, and Rango. These names concerned the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold, respectively.</p><p>At the time, designs hadn't been speculated yet; however, rumors from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">this past winter</a> might've given us something to think about. A host of rumors from a social media tipster gave us a rumored glimpse at the Pixel 10 series, which could look exactly like the 9 series. It seems Google could stick with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">same large camera bar</a>, rounded corners, flat display, and the like.</p><p>Even the early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-alleged-porcelain-renderings-leaked">Pixel 10 Pro Fold leaked renders</a> suggest a phone that won't diverge much from last year's.</p><p>These are design elements Thinborne has seemingly adhered to in its early Pixel 10 case collection.</p><p>Additionally, rumors claim the base Pixel 10 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10s-rumored-telephoto-camera-upgrade-could-make-your-macro-shots-pop">could feature a triple camera setup</a>, like its higher-tier friends.

At a rumored 3.9mm thin when unfolded, it makes the 5.6mm Z Fold 6 look like a chonker. However, it also raises a few simple questions, such as: how would Samsung achieve this without making big sacrifices, particularly in the camera performance?</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>Aside from a thinner phone, one of the biggest requests from Z Fold users has been for Samsung to improve the cameras. Galaxy Z Fold phones have never had <em>bad</em> cameras, but there's never been a Z Fold that could outperform the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best camera phones</a>. This has long been a perplexing problem, given that the Z Fold costs nearly $2,000 and has never been "thin," but can Samsung really make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> thin <em>and</em> give it an award-winning camera?</p><p>Yes, absolutely, and two other ultra-thin foldables are proof. In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">review of the Oppo Find N5</a>, which is currently the thinnest phone in the world <em>and</em> a book style foldable like the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Harish said "the cameras on the Find N5 are better than the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9, and that's a big deal in and of itself." Even Samsung's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> with its 200MP camera sensor proves it's possible.</p><p>Since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-big-charger-upgrade-databse-listing-rumor">the upcoming Honor Magic V5</a> is set to be the most direct competitor to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and is said to be at least as thin as Samsung's phone, I thought it would be fun to take last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> and test its cameras against the best flagship cameras of 2025.

I prefer Samsung's tuning in that arena, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review">OnePlus 13</a> is normally quite spot on with color science on the ultrawide camera.

In the 10x shots, you can tell the Magic V3's shot is slightly softer, but on its own, I doubt anyone would notice this. The telephoto camera is quite good and does a great job of zooming in on things.

The music streaming service initially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-music-tests-new-spotify-like-lyrics-sharing-feature">began testing lyric sharing in April 2025</a>, but the tool is now widely rolling out for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> users as of today, June 17 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/17/youtube-music-lyrics-sharing-2/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). It's available on version 8.24 of the YouTube Music app for iOS and Android.</p><p>With lyric sharing, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> users can create a shareable card with a few lines of lyrics from the song they're currently listening to. When available, the feature adds a new floating action button to the Lyrics tab of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-musics-now-playing-controls-are-moved-around-in-latest-test">Now Playing user-interface</a> called <strong>Share</strong>. After tapping it, you can select which groupings of lyric lines you'd like to use to create the shareable card.</p><p>You can pick the background color of your lyric card, and continuing will create the finalized graphic. It'll show the song title, artist, album artwork, selected lyrics, and a subtle YouTube Music logo. It's essentially creating an image that can be saved to your device's camera roll or shared with other apps.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ssQX6ejwEyPoQws95GmhRX" name="YouTube-Music-Lyric-Sharing" alt="The new lyric sharing feature in YouTube Music." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ssQX6ejwEyPoQws95GmhRX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since the feature simply shares an image of your lyric card, you'll need to manually add audio to lyrics shared on your social accounts. For instance, if you wanted to add YouTube Music lyrics to your Instagram story, you'll still need to select a track for your story as you normally would in order for music to play. Otherwise, it'll only take a few taps to create and share a YouTube Music lyrics card.</p><p>Lyric sharing is available for both free and paid YouTube Music accounts running the latest version of the mobile app (version 8.24 on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.youtube.music&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-music/id1017492454" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a>).</p><p>The YouTube Music app was last updated yesterday, June 16, on both iOS and Android. However, this seems like a server-side change, so force stop your YouTube Music app if you aren't able to create lyric cards yet.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, it did help to type "Adobe Firefly" to get the app to appear in the store's listings.</p><p>Joining this mobile app launch is Adobe's announcement of new image and video generative models. In its post, the company states it has partnered with ideogram, Luma, Pika, and runway.

The company's Alexandru Costin, vice president, generative AI, commented saying, "Ideating with Firefly Boards is like an AI-powered creative jam session, where creative professionals can riff across media types, explore ideas together and turn sparks of inspiration into production-ready concepts."</p><p>As such, Firefly Boards is picking up a "Generative Video" option. Thanks to Google, Luma AI, and Pika, users will find convenient text-to-video generation capabilities, which can be placed right into a Board. Additionally, users can now utilize Firefly Boards' AI to make "iterative edits" to images. This is done via simple text prompts. You tell the AI what you'd like to change and watch it come to life.</p><p>Lastly, Adobe is rolling out some QoL updates, such as one-click arrange. The post states users can now "instantly" arrange the content in their Board to be more presentable. "Linked Docs" is another feature that arrives, giving users the option to link their Adobe documents in Boards.</p> ]]></dc:content>
