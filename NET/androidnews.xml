It marked the arrival of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> a few months earlier than I originally expected, but OnePlus is forging ahead with a classy new flagship phone design and a bunch of new camera tricks up its sleeve.</p><p>This is the first flagship OnePlus phone in years to drop the Hasselblad branding in favor of the company's new in-house <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-shift-from-hasselblad-official-debuts-detailmax-engine">DetailMax Engine</a>. If I've had any one complaint about the OnePlus 13's camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review">since I reviewed it earlier this year</a>, it's that the Hasselblad processing can sometimes be too aggressive with its contrast and often tones down vibrant colors too much for my liking.</p><p>So far, the new DetailMax Engine looks to fix both of these issues, giving me a more realistic picture that looked like what my eyes saw, not what the camera software thought might look better. The weather has been fairly abysmal in my part of the world this weekend, but I was able to head up to the mountains at the end of last week while it was a clear, calm morning and capture Fall in a way that felt authentic.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0

especially important if you're looking to see what the phone is truly capable of.</p><p>OnePlus's CEO, Pete Lau, previously said the new DetailMax Engine can "capture and interpret vastly more data, delivering images with unmatched depth and realism, " ensuring that photos never receive "over-beautification or distortion." Again, based on my time with the phone so far, this seems to absolutely nail my experience.</p><p>At this time, I'm only able to share a few photos of my adventures with the phone but plan to showcase a full review of its camera capabilities in the coming weeks. OnePlus is rumored to debut the phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-price-leak">at a lower price</a> and earlier than expected. Rumors note a global launch may happen as early as Novemer 13, two full months ahead of the anniversary of the OnePlus 13's global launch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Ask Home allows users to get answers to quick questions about their home from a natural language chatbot. It can provide daily summaries, handle complex multi-step queries, and serve as a search bar for in-app toggles.</p><p>The Google Home redesign split the app into three distinct pages: <strong>Home</strong>, <strong>Activity</strong>, and <strong>Automations</strong>. However, some users reported issues with scrolling in the Home tab on iOS following the overhaul. In the version 4.1 revision, Google says the Home tab experience is now "smoother and more responsive."</p><p>The company also fixed a bug affecting the color status for items in the <strong>Lights</strong> category on the Android app. The prior version failed to change color when a light was turned off, but it now turns grey as expected.</p><p>Finally, the Google Home app now includes a fix for Ask Home summaries being described incorrectly. The release notes explain that summaries were sometimes called "today's Home Brief" when they were actually about the day prior.</p><h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-use-ask-home-in-the-new-google-home-app-2">What do I need to use Ask Home in the new Google Home app?</h2><p>Google is rolling out Ask Home to more users with the release of version 4.1 of the Home app, but you'll need a Google Home Premium subscription. There's a standard version for $10 per month or $100 per year, or an advanced tier for $20 per month or $200 per year. It's the successor to Nest Aware, the previous subscription service for Google Home and Nest products.</p><p>However, you might already be getting Google Home Premium access for free.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Meta launched its Ray-Ban Display smart glasses at the end of last month, and it was on the softer side. The company made Meta Ray-Ban Display only available for purchase after completing an in-store demo. The reasoning behind the decision was so that customers could interact with the device and get a proper sizing for the sEMG wristband before buying it.</p><p>Naturally, that made getting a Meta Ray-Ban Display a bit trickier at launch. There were some initial scheduling hiccups, as recounted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RaybanMeta/comments/1nvlxl5/update_on_meta_rayban_displays_the_info_they/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a>, and limited demo availability. Demos and delivery dates quickly slipped into November and December. Initially, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-put-the-future-of-tech-on-your-face">Meta said the Ray-Ban Display demos</a> would be available at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/best-buy">Best Buy</a>, LensCrafters, Ray-Ban Stores, and Verizon stores.</p><p>Verizon is only now starting to carry Meta Ray-Ban Display and accept demo bookings for the smart glasses. The first day of availability is Nov. 5, and you can schedule a demo slot now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/demo/scheduler/" target="_blank">Meta's website</a>. If you're lucky enough to live near a Verizon store offering Meta Ray-Ban Display demos, you might not have to wait long — there are still plenty of opening-week demos at Verizon stores at the time of publishing.</p><p>After completing the demo, you can buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> straight from Verizon. It doesn't look like you need to be a Verizon customer to buy a pair, and they're available for the same $799 retail price at the wireless carrier. However, only the Black colorway is sold at Verizon, so you're out of luck if you're on the hunt for Sand.</p><h2 id="which-verizon-stores-will-offer-meta-ray-ban-display-demos-2">Which Verizon stores will offer Meta Ray-Ban Display demos?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dKQz3aLAYpWp5qsFRU2ebm" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-glasses-close-up-front" alt="A close-up photo of the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses held facing the camera to show the design, camera cutouts, and lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dKQz3aLAYpWp5qsFRU2ebm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For now, demo availability of Meta Ray-Ban Display is quite limited at Verizon stores.

The streaming service debuted in 2015 along YouTube Premium, and a decade later, it has over 125 million paid subscribers as of March 2025. The large subscriber count and user base allows <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> to inject more cash into the music industry, and it hit a big milestone in 2025.</p><p>YouTube paid out more than $8 billion to the music industry in the year between July 2024 and June 2025, it said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/8-billion-youtubes-twin-engine-continues-to-fuel-the-future-of-music/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The brand says this major payout reaffirms its "commitment to the music industry." It's the most YouTube Music has ever paid out to artists and the music industry at large in a 12-month period, and shows that payouts are rising with subscriber counts.</p><p>"Today's $8 billion payout is a testament to the fact that the twin engine of ads and subscriptions is firing on all cylinders," said Lyor Cohen, who is YouTube's global head of music, in the blog post. "This number is not an endpoint; it represents meaningful, sustained progress in our journey to build a long-term home for every artist, songwriter, and publisher on the global stage."</p><p>The company attributes the larger payouts to what it calls a "twin-engine revenue model." That includes subscriber revenue from the over 125 million users that pay for either YouTube Music or YouTube Premium. It also includes logged-in viewers who watch music videos on YouTube and see ads — YouTube says there are 2 billion of them each month.</p><p>Between revenue sharing from subscribers and ad-supported users, YouTube Music was able to pay out the $8 billion figure to the music industry.</p><h2 id="how-youtube-music-s-payout-compares-to-itself-and-the-competition-2">How YouTube Music's payout compares to itself — and the competition</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XfwbFm6ePPoVYnfBaTi7mC" name="YouTube-Music-Beyond-the-Beat" alt="YouTube Music Beyond the Beat" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XfwbFm6ePPoVYnfBaTi7mC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3488" height="1962" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube Music's payouts are rising with its subscriber count.

Spotify, the industry leader and YouTube Music's biggest competitor, paid $10 billion to the music industry in 2024.</p><p>While YouTube Music isn't quite on Spotify's level yet, it's inching closer. Despite having far fewer subscribers, YouTube Music's industry payout is impressive because it pays more on a per-stream basis than Spotify, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://report.duetti.co/#1" target="_blank">Duetti</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/26/chrome-141-android-m3-expressive-redesign/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the rollout has been completed for most users, marking the end of the gradual deployment that began in late August.</p><p>Now, tapping the three-dot menu brings forward key actions (forward, bookmark, download, site info, refresh) inside circular icons.</p><p>In the Tab Grid view, the “+” for opening a new tab now lives inside a rounded square, and tabs, Incognito, and Groups all have clearer containers. Dynamic Color theming is applied (so it adapts to your wallpaper or chosen palette).</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:421px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:206.65%;"><img id="3TKQAwquFSsBicgaKpKwNj" name="Chrome-for-Android-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive on Chrome for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3TKQAwquFSsBicgaKpKwNj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="421" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:207.14%;"><img id="j4bNLtSPUkq8UmZu2dCGFj" name="Chrome-for-Android-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive on Chrome for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j4bNLtSPUkq8UmZu2dCGFj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="420" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="no-functional-shake-up-2">No functional shake-up</h2><p>Despite the splashier look, Chrome didn’t adjust button sizes or radically alter list-views or settings pages. It’s more a cosmetic refresh than a full redesign. The browser’s interface remains familiar enough that you won’t feel lost.</p><p>That means if you’re used to how Chrome worked before, you’ll still feel right at home. The update is more about aligning with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Google’s broader design language</a> across apps than reinventing everything.</p><p>There are smaller details, too. Watch as a page loads, and you'll notice a segmented progress indicator with rounded corners. Similarly, when you visit a website you've already bookmarked, the star icon in the menu will now have a rounded square background.</p><p>If you haven’t seen the new look yet, there’s a reason: the rollout is server-side. That means even if your Chrome version says 141 or higher, you may still be waiting for the visual switch to hit your device. Quick tip: force-stop the app (via Android Settings → Apps → Chrome → Force Stop) and then reopen it. That sometimes triggers the update faster.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After leading the foldable market with the Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip, the company plans to reveal its first tri-fold smartphone later this week. But according to a recent rumor, the launch will be limited, and the U.S. probably won't get it right away.</p><p>The Korean tech giant is set to pull the wraps off the Galaxy Z TriFold at the APEC CEO Summit in South Korea, happening October 28–31. This launch marks the company’s jump into a completely new device category, featuring a dual-hinge setup that lets the phone fold twice.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-just-showed-off-its-unfolding-trick-in-a-leaked-animation">feature a dual-hinge in-folding design</a>, meaning both sides fold inward toward the main display. When closed, the phone looks like a typical smartphone with a 6.5-inch cover display, but once unfolded in stages, it can expand to 8 inches and, fully opened, stretch to a massive 10-inch screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:763px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.67%;"><img id="R26KV66tJrgcF2TQna9q9Y" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Trifold-unfolding" alt="unfolding and folding mechanism of the Galaxy Z Trifold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R26KV66tJrgcF2TQna9q9Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="763" height="585" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @TechHighest / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Early reports suggest Samsung has been refining the hinge durability and optimizing the display software to ensure seamless transitions between folded modes. Under the hood, the TriFold is rumored to run on last year’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset rather than Qualcomm’s latest processor.</p><p>The price will put this phone firmly in the ultra-premium range, with estimates around 4 million won, or about $2,780. To reduce risk, Samsung is reportedly limiting the first batch to about 50,000 units, which makes sense since this is still an experimental product.</p><h2 id="western-markets-might-be-skipped-2">Western markets might be skipped</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unfortunately for foldable enthusiasts -- and despite recent rumors to the contrary -- I think it's very unlikely that Samsung will release its first trifold beyond Korea, the greater Chinese market (including Singapore & Taiwan), & possibly the UAE.

As the company moves into this new area, people will be watching to see how the TriFold performs in real life, including its hinge strength, battery life, and how well Android works with the changing screen sizes.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold could set the tone for the next generation of portable devices that blur the lines between phones, tablets, and even small laptops.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature quietly started rolling out this week, with a Pixel 10 Pro owner reporting on Reddit that they can now enable Voice Translate during a phone call.</p><p>Voice Translate is one of the standout features introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10</a> series, powered by the new Tensor G5 chip.

At the same time, you hear their translated response in your language, creating a surprisingly fluid two-way conversation.</p><p>All of this happens on-device, meaning translations don’t rely on Google’s servers or an internet connection.

But with frequent videos or livestreaming, you'll burn through battery quickly.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-gen-2-camera-and-video-tests"><span>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2): Camera and video tests</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xNEGWsXdX57MRnXNYWetqX" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-close-up-front" alt="A photo of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses sitting on a rock, close up of the front lenses and camera cutouts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xNEGWsXdX57MRnXNYWetqX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Versus</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-2-vs-gen-1"><strong>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Gen 1</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-vs-oakley-meta-hstn"><strong>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Oakley Meta HSTN</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-vs-oakley-meta-hstn"><strong>Oakley Meta Vanguard vs. Oakley Meta HSTN</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Camera quality from the 12MP ultrawide sensor hasn't changed since the Gen 1 glasses, and my thoughts from 2023 apply to the Gen 2s.</p><p>Meta's camera is excellent at catching moving targets or adjusting to your movement; I've taken great shots while running.

The question is, should a Garmin watch owner spend $500 on Meta AI glasses? Or are they not the right fit?</p><p>During my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-hands-on">Vanguard glasses hands-on</a>, I introduced the Garmin-Meta integration and why these smart glasses have become a regular companion for my workouts. But I acknowledged that some Garmin tools are more useful than others, and that some athletes will be uncomfortable sharing workout data with Meta.</p><p>Here, I'll go more in-depth on the Garmin features available on Oakley Meta Vanguard (and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses</a> once they receive the update). Here's how it works in practice, which features work best, and whether Garmin fans should care.</p><h2 id="compatible-garmin-devices-2">Compatible Garmin devices</h2><ul><li>D2 Mach 1 (Pro)</li><li>Edge 540 / 550 / 840 / 850 / 1040 / 1050 / MTB</li><li>Enduro 2 / 3</li><li>EPIX Pro / Gen 2</li><li>Fenix 7 / 7S / 7X (Pro) / 8 (Pro) / E</li><li>Forerunner 165 / 265 / 570 / 965 / 970</li><li>MARQ Gen 2</li><li>Quatix 7 (Pro) / 8</li><li>Tactix 7 (Pro) / 8</li><li>Venu 3 / 4 / X1</li><li>Vivoactive 5 / 6</li></ul><p>Most new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> work, but not older models.

I'd guess newer watches' faster processors make it easier to share workout data promptly.</p><h2 id="real-time-garmin-stats-2">Real-time Garmin stats</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="meZASeH7vZMVRJQTSHwMQE" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-and-Garmin-Venu-X1" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses and Garmin Venu X1 smartwatch sitting on a wooden board together." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/meZASeH7vZMVRJQTSHwMQE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most notable Garmin tool on Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses is real-time stats. Once you start a workout, you can say, "Hey Meta, what's my current running power?" or "What's my average heart rate?" and Meta will pull that data from your watch or bike computer — though your phone needs to be there as an intermediary.</p><p>I appreciate that I can ask Meta AI for stats Garmin tracks that I never added to my activity data screens.</p><p>More generally, some athletes need to keep their eyes forward for safety (cyclists) or can't easily check their wrist during exercise (weightlifters), while others want to use their watch's display for maps (hikers, trail runners). Having audio access to core Garmin stats without breaking stride is a nice perk.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Y4Dmfvii5FvCZGz7qejWDb" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-run-widget" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing the main Running widget, with time, distance, pace, and heart rate." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y4Dmfvii5FvCZGz7qejWDb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To make this feature even better, Meta AI should listen for special keywords when it detects an active Garmin activity. Saying "Hey Meta, what's my X" every time is annoying when you're breathing hard; simply saying "Heart rate," "Pace," or other commonly requested stats would be more seamless.</p><p>Another downside is that Meta AI can't describe <em>every</em> real-time stat, even if it understands what I'm asking. I asked for stride length and got my cadence; instead of speed, it said my pace. Some more obscure stats, like real-time stamina or total calories, stumped the AI.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="UpSL26Qj6wXE7z6nDDxTKE" name="Engo-2-AR-glasses-on-face" alt="ENGO 2 AR glasses worn on the author's face in a selfie photo; the angle shows how thick the HUD portion of the glasses is." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UpSL26Qj6wXE7z6nDDxTKE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nRQhMPnYwnDaQnViacY4Dn" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-glasses-on-face" alt="A selfie of the author wearing the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses with transition lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nRQhMPnYwnDaQnViacY4Dn.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Despite these nitpicks — which I think Meta and Garmin will address over time — real-time stats are one of the Oakley Meta Vanguard's best features for Garmin users obsessed with data.</p><p>I'm sure some of you would prefer sporty Meta HUD glasses like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ar-running-glasses-arent-ready-yet-but-future-is-almost-here">ENGO 2s</a> to see your real-time stats without having to ask.

The Vanguards capture a five-second video clip after each trigger; once you've finished your workout, Meta takes these clips and any other photos and videos you captured manually, then organizes them into a shareable montage video, with a Garmin widget showing your live stats at each point.</p><p>You can edit which clips or stats (distance, pace, ascent, time, HR, or power) appear in the video, as well as whether to include the original audio, which tends to be heavy breathing and audio spill, in my case.</p><p>For an exciting marathon or trail run with gorgeous scenery, Autocapture summarizes your experience in a fun way, whether for social media or your own memories. But I have a few fundamental issues.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="c35922bo7jz8iM5sZXpMED" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-held-in-hand" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses held in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c35922bo7jz8iM5sZXpMED.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, the "smart triggers" only stumble into a few compelling shots by accident. It's mostly stitched-together footage of random moments of my runs, none especially noteworthy unless I took them myself.</p><p>Collected together, the footage is interesting, but Meta dumps each five-second clip into your Photos app after the workout, cluttering up your storage. I'd prefer that Meta delete any auto-shot clips after you've edited the compilation.</p><p>Most importantly, it's incredibly awkward to have your glasses start auto-recording when someone is walking toward you on a public path. The last thing I want is for people to assume I'm intentionally recording them, but I can't stop triggers from... triggering; I can only look away awkwardly.</p><p>Overall, I think the feature is quite cool in a vacuum, but I won't use Autocapture outside of public race events where people expect to be recorded, or empty trails.</p><h2 id="status-led-2">Status LED</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="duQXj2sNo7hPzKtP5FyVkC" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-Status-LED" alt="A close-up of the Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses' inner-right arm and right lens, where a red Status LED is visible along the right lens's edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/duQXj2sNo7hPzKtP5FyVkC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Start a workout with a target HR, pace, or power zone, and Meta's inward-facing LED — usually indicating Meta AI or video recording is active — will light up red whenever you're out of zone.</p><p>It's elegantly simple. Since Garmin's out-of-zone and back-in-zone vibrations feel the same, you have to look at your watch every time, which can be distracting. The red LED in your periphery removes any uncertainty, letting you keep your gaze forward while adjusting your pace.</p><p>Eventually, I think it'd be cool if Meta showed red or blue LEDs to indicate above- or below-zone warnings, respectively.</p><h2 id="activity-summaries-2">Activity Summaries</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tUM7HYULTzMSsSJEypdh4U" name="meta-ai-summary-screenshots-garmin" alt="Meta AI app screenshots showing summaries of three separate runs, describing how the efforts compared against past activities." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tUM7HYULTzMSsSJEypdh4U.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is arguably the most odd Garmin-Meta integration. Whether you're running with Meta glasses or not, the Meta AI app will summarize every workout you finish within the context of your last 30 days of workouts, focused on specific stats like pace, cadence, and distance.</p><p>Meta AI will intelligently recommend recovery days after hard runs or suggest "incorporating interval training or speed work" if Meta thinks you're taking things too easy. Its comparisons to past runs are similar to what you'd see from Strava's Athlete Intelligence, only without a subscription.</p><p>I've found that these summaries tend to be dismissive of shorter, low-aerobic runs, saying "no significant trend was detected," and Meta AI only seems to interpret a few workout types, having no opinion on my recent hike. So there's certainly room to grow.</p><p>These summaries are best suited to newer athletes who can't analyze their workout trends and don't want to pay for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect Plus</a>.</p><h2 id="oakley-meta-vanguard-will-appeal-to-some-garmin-users-but-not-all-2">Oakley Meta Vanguard will appeal to some Garmin users, but not all</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gNHKxa9rUkZFJqLXhvCCbk" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-close-up-selfie" alt="A selfie of the author wearing Oakley Meta Vanguard White/ Prizm Sapphire smart glasses with blurry trees behind him." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gNHKxa9rUkZFJqLXhvCCbk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Garmin-Meta software integration is a work-in-progress, but very promising, and I'd love it if Meta partnered with other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> brands eventually. For now, Garmin watch owners have the best perks, but they'll need to decide based on software <em>and</em> hardware.</p><p>I think the Vanguard's Oakley Sphaera aesthetic looks great, the weight is a bit heavy but manageable, and the Prizm lenses offer excellent eye protection.

They might not know that artificial intelligence is powering the broadcasts behind the scenes, specifically Gemini and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-cloud-is-adding-six-new-ai-agents-for-devs-scientists-and-power-users">Google Cloud</a>.</p><p>Google published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/fox-sports-major-league-baseball/" target="_blank">blog post</a> detailing its AI efforts in the World Series, and it's an interesting look into how the technology is being used in the real world. It starts with a platform called Fox Foresight, which uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and Google Cloud smarts to provide quick insights into baseball stats and trends.</p><p>Fox Foresight is trained on data from "many seasons" of Major League Baseball play, "down to the smallest details," according to Google. The tool aims to provide timely answers — ideally in seconds — to specific questions based on in-game situations.</p><p>The Gemini-powered platform can quickly pull up stats in response to questions like, "Who are the top five left-handed batters who played in this year's playoffs?" It can also handle follow-ups, such as "Now who was best in the ninth inning, and what about when the bases are loaded?"</p><p>These examples from Google demonstrate how Fox broadcasters are using Google AI to commentate during the biggest games in sports, like the World Series.</p><p>"It helps us spot the big stories — like who's heating up, who's struggling and which performances are shaping this postseason," said MLB player and Fox Sports analyst Alex Rodriguez in the blog post.</p><h2 id="other-ways-google-cloud-is-powering-mlb-broadcasts-2">Other ways Google Cloud is powering MLB broadcasts</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NrC6Bo4HMBSdf7qf7Qq52f" name="Google-cloud-mwc-sign-02.jpg" alt="Google Cloud at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrC6Bo4HMBSdf7qf7Qq52f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google also shared how MLB is using a Connectivity Agent, affectionately named "Connie," to monitor the status of connectivity and network feeds during broadcasts.

Currently, it's possible to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/switching-iphone-android">transfer some things across the two platforms</a>, but certain items like app data get left behind. Apple is working to change that with a new AppMigrationKit framework specifically designed to transfer app data between iOS and Android devices.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appmigrationkit" target="_blank">AppMigrationKit</a> is currently in beta, and it's being tested alongside the beta releases of iOS 26.1 and iPadOS 26.1. In rare fashion, the documentation for AppMigrationKit specifically states this framework is not intended for use within the Apple ecosystem:</p><div><blockquote><p>AppMigrationKit only supports migration to and from non-Apple platforms, such as Android. The system doesn’t use the framework for migration between iOS or iPadOS devices. The framework also has no functionality in iOS apps running in visionOS or in macOS on Apple silicon. The framework ignores calls from Mac apps built with Mac Catalyst.</p><p>Apple Developer</p></blockquote></div><p>The documentation specifically calls out Android, signaling that iOS devices will soon be able to transfer app data to and from the Google platform. Apple says developers can use the AppMigrationKit to "export your app’s on-device data to another device running a non-Apple platform, or to import from another platform, or both."</p><p>In other words, the migration process will be supercharged when setting up a new Android phone with an iPhone.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Chances are, even if you're an Android user waiting for access to the viral Sora app, you've seen a video created or shared on the platform. It's OpenAI's latest foray into consumer apps, and claimed the number one spot on App Store charts for weeks. The social platform is designed around generating and sharing short videos created with AI, and it seems to be slowly-changing public perception of AI-generated content — from slop to social.</p><p>Now, OpenAI has confirmed that an Android app is officially on the Sora roadmap. "Finally, the Android version of Sora is actually coming soon," wrote Bill Peebles, who is OpenAI's head of Sora, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/billpeeb/status/1981118483607032050" target="_blank">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p><p>The upcoming Sora app for Android will join a slew of future features Peebles also teased in the post. Character cameos is arriving in "the coming days," and it'll let Sora users create AI-generated videos of their favorite pets or inanimate objects.</p><p>"We're expecting people to register lots of crazy new cameos with this feature," Peebles explained. "To make them easier to find, we're updating the generation UI to show the latest trending cameos in real time."</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">sora roadmap update: in the spirit of building this app openly, here's what we're landing soon.first, more creation tools. character cameos are coming in the next few days: you'll be able to cameo your dog, guinea pig, favorite stuffed toy, and pretty much anything else you… pic.twitter.com/GX7CJXWRcZ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1981118483607032050">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Cameos are a core feature of the Sora app — they're AI-generated videos created of yourself based on a sample video you upload for training. After providing Sora with a video of yourself, you can make AI videos of your lifelike doppelgänger doing basically anything. From there, these videos can be shared in a "For you" style social feed with others, much like TikTok or Instagram.</p><p>"We're working on making the social experience much better," Peebles wrote. "We are exploring new ways to use Sora with your friends (versus just a global feed) and broader community. Think channels that are specific to your university, company, sports club, etc."</p><p>Character cameos and improved social features will join basic video-editing tools, so users can stitch clips without leaving the Sora app. Currently, Sora is only available on the web and iOS, but these features will presumably arrive on the now-confirmed Android app.</p><h2 id="how-you-can-use-sora-on-android-today-2">How you can use Sora on Android today</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e17a5ac2-f1cd-4bf3-99e1-40cfe0b0d235" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Visit: Sora.com" data-dimension48="Visit: Sora.com" href="https://sora.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="DVYNN4W5Bjr5LAYFvjSm9V" name="Sora-OpenAI-App" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DVYNN4W5Bjr5LAYFvjSm9V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sora by OpenAI</strong></p><p>To add it to your home screen, <strong>visit the link below</strong>, tap the <strong>three-button menu</strong> in Chrome, press <strong>Add to home screen</strong>, and tap <strong>Install </strong>to finish.

I spend a lot of time at the gym, working out and lifting weights several times a week, but cardio and running are the bane of my existence. I never quite understood how and why anyone would enjoy running. Why subject yourself to that?</p><p>However, for the past couple of months, I’ve been using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and the Fitbit app to do just that. Despite my better judgment, I decided it’s time to change my routine, spending nearly every morning running to see how I can improve the duration and distance of my runs.</p><p>To do this, I’ve been utilizing the AI-powered daily run recommendations in the Fitbit app. I’ve been curious to see whether these recommendations are really helpful or if it’s just another glorified AI feature with no real rhyme or reason to its suggestions. Turns out, this could actually be a fantastic tool for beginners like me, making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-couch-5k-apps">couch-to-5K journey</a> a little less daunting.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

It’s important to note that this isn’t a running “plan,” per se, so I couldn’t see ahead to what my runs would look like. The Fitbit app would take my previous workout data as well as my target load to surface a new recommendation for me each day.</p><p>While a viewable workout plan of some sort would be nice, what I like about this feature is that the workouts feel like they’re perfectly tailored to me and my capabilities. Going into this, I could only comfortably run about a mile before I would tire and have to stop. Therefore, based on what Fitbit knows about me and my goals, it was able to get me started with some very easy runs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="j43mKUx6LscgU5hwjpN4kP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Fitbit-AI-run-recommendations-6" alt="Easy run Fitbit recommendation on the Fitbit app and Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j43mKUx6LscgU5hwjpN4kP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These runs would vary each day, typically between an easy run and a tempo run, with the former keeping me at a relatively moderate heart rate and the latter pushing me into a more vigorous heart rate zone. The duration of the runs also varies, from shorter 18-minute runs to longer 40-minute runs.</p><p>That said, even the shorter runs challenged me, as I would previously average about 10 minutes before I called it quits. However, this was a very manageable challenge, as I had a target heart rate range that I would have to maintain. This helped me manage by breathing more effectively, while also reminding me that I do not have to run as fast as I can all the time; I can take my time at a steady pace to keep me going for a longer period of time.</p><p>Additionally, Fitbit would also mix things up so the intervals were always different from day to day. Sometimes it would have me do a single run for a certain period of time, or it would break up my run, starting me off slower and steadily pushing me to run faster, or having me maintain a faster pace but for short periods with even shorter rest periods between them. This helped me get used to pacing myself while helping me build my endurance and mileage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="JNF4zLbFF4npozGF5eeV8P" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Fitbit-AI-run-recommendations-5" alt="Fitbit Personalized workouts customization screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNF4zLbFF4npozGF5eeV8P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The best part is that you don’t have to follow each run exactly as it appears.

It's not just about the silicon chips themselves, but about the network of energy, water, and resources required to power and sustain them all. Consider the following:</p><p><strong>AI is hungry:</strong> Training and operating advanced AI models, like the ubiquitous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-could-be-set-as-default-assistant">ChatGPT</a>, consumes <em>staggering</em> amounts of electricity. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/projecting-the-electricity-demand-growth-of-generative-ai-large-language-models-in-the-us/" target="_blank">Some projections</a> estimate that AI could account for up to 0.5% of global electricity consumption by 2027. This could even lead to the resurrection of dormant coal-fired power plants — an idea that sends shivers down the spines of anyone concerned about carbon emissions.</p><p><strong>Machines are thirsty:</strong> Data centers powering AI require <em>colossal</em> amounts of water for cooling. Google, for instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-water-use-soaring-ai-make-it-worse-data-centers-2023-7" target="_blank">consumed an astounding <em>21 billion liters</em> of water in 2022</a> alone. By 2027, this figure could balloon to six times Denmark's <em><strong>entire</strong></em> annual water usage.</p><p><strong>A mountain of e-waste:</strong> The demand for newer, more powerful hardware creates a mountain of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-lg-sues-indian-government-e-waste-floor-pricing">electronic waste</a>.

Before the turn of the century, the environmental impact of computing was mostly an afterthought, and "Green IT" was just a whisper, if it was even mentioned at all.</p><p>The 21st century changed everything, driven by the exponential growth of data centers. As facilities consumed more energy, concerns about their environmental footprint grew. Initiatives like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Savers_Computing_Initiative" target="_blank">Climate Savers Computing Initiative</a> emerged, seeking to promote greater energy efficiency.</p><p>However, introducing "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-omnibox-address-bar-gains-machine-learning">deep learning</a>" and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gcd-2024-google-ai-tested-llm-chatbots-with-werewolf">large language models</a> (LLMs) in the 2010s ushered in a new era. The sheer scale of computation required to train and deploy these AI models transformed AI's environmental impact from a concern to a crisis.

Google touts this as a "reliable, low-carbon power source" for its data centers, particularly in regions where renewable energy sources are not always readily available.</p><p>But is this a genuine step towards a sustainable future, or simply a clever ploy to maintain its energy-hungry AI operations under a disguise of environmental responsibility?</p><h2 id="the-challenges-of-ccs-2">The challenges of CCS</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uSc9VxALdcwXQL7vDUnLic" name="lake-scene" alt="A still mountain lake" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uSc9VxALdcwXQL7vDUnLic.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3984" height="2241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand/Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology holds the promise of removing emissions from industries that are difficult to decarbonize, potentially playing a crucial role in achieving net-zero goals. Proponents point to advancements in Direct Air Capture (DAC) and Bio-Energy with CCS (BECCS) as evidence of CCS's potential.</p><p>However, CCS faces deserved criticism. Detractors argue that it is expensive, slow to scale, and energy-intensive. The current deployment of CCS technology lags far behind the levels needed to make a significant impact. Some critics also argue that CCS allows fossil fuel industries to continue operating, delaying the transition to renewable energy sources.</p><p>Public skepticism also poses a challenge.

Google states that its rendering update makes it possible for users to copy formulas, edit them directly in Canvas, and download them as a PDF. Canvas itself is getting an update in October, one that brings closer compatibility between it and Google Slides.</p><p>The post states that users need only provide Gemini with a topic or upload some source material and let the AI do the rest. Gemini is said to have the ability to generate "a full set of slides" featuring an overall theme and "relevant" imagery. This next bit concerns Google AI Pro subscribers, as the company details the option of exporting Gemini's creations into the Slides app.</p><p>It states this exporting function is arriving for Pro subscribers today (Oct 24); however, Free users will see it in "the coming weeks."</p><p>Finally, Google's 2.5 Flash model is gaining enhanced smarts for complex topics.

This was an update the company teased during CES 2025, which finally started rolling out in late September. Users can naturally converse with Gemini about previous season recaps for shows and even questions about recommendations it may have for entertainment. Gemini for Google TV also picked up a more educational update, letting kids learn about the world with helpful YouTube videos.</p><p>While the major update is finally here, not everyone can get in on it. Gemini for Google TV arrived for TCL QM9K series devices first. It will then roll out onto the Google TV Streamer, Walmart Onn. 4K Pro, 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and more "later this year."</p><p>Another highlight update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-steps-up-its-creativity-in-3-1-version-update-for-realism">Gemini was the Veo 3.1 update</a>. This major update for its video generation model landed in the Gemini app and Flow with a focus on "realism." Veo 3.1 offers more realistic textures, richer sound, and better narrative control for users looking to bring their ideas to AI-generated life.</p><p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-drop-visual-guidance-camera-and-major-image-editing">September Gemini Drop</a> was all about cameras—and image editing.

In response to Nothing's $10 million claim to develop such tech, the WPC stated the following to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/oPAcUyprayM?t=245">YouTuber TechAltar</a>: "If Nothing was a WPC member, they would have access to the specs and favorable licensing terms under RAND."</p><p>It adds, "Knowing that Google, HMD, Samsung (plus others soon) already are using the magnets in phones or covers suggests that Nothing may not understand the situation."</p><p>The host of the channel, Marton Barcza, states Nothing likes to upload playful videos about "hypothetical devices" and the purported "cost" it would take to make those real. It was during one of those videos that Nothing said it would cost an unimaginable amount of money to develop the magnetic wireless charging system. The company adds that while "the magnets in your device are not the exact same configuration as Apple's MagSafe, there's a good chance the coils may not be perfectly aligned, and you won't get the optimized charge speed, and you'll generate more heat."</p><p>Nothing claimed that "a lot of companies" have probably weighed this risk, coupled with the supposed cost demand, and have settled for wired charging, which is faster.</p><h2 id="qi2-s-not-out-of-the-question-2">Qi2's not out of the question</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2G6RZi2Q4WRsUHjcFvJQjb" name="Nothing Qi2 battery pack concept, Battery (1), render" alt="Nothing Qi2 battery pack concept, Battery (1), render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2G6RZi2Q4WRsUHjcFvJQjb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 3DPrintedCat / Nothing Community)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Barcza said that they went into research, meeting with industry experts and even the WPC about Qi2 and Nothing, but didn't hear anything like the comments made. It's assumed that there's just some miscommunication, but Barcza states that the magnetic alignment is "a part of the standard." This essentially means that companies wouldn't have to "recreate" anything if they want to implement it into their devices for wireless charging.</p><p>We've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothings-take-on-qi2">been excited and interested</a> in Nothing developing proper Qi2-capable devices and the accessories for it, but nothing's (no pun intended) happened yet. The Phone 3a and 3a Pro debuted without Qi2 support, much like the Nothing Phone 3, which lacks the newer alignment to support it, as well.</p><p>When we get down to the WPC's comments, Google and Samsung both feature Qi2, just in different ways—and varying support. Google's recent Pixel 10 series features full Qi2 support, meaning everything is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">integrated within the phones</a> themselves.

Samsung now appears to have released another internal build of One UI 8.5 for the Galaxy S25, introducing some new features we're seeing for the first time.</p><p>According to reliable Samsung leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1981397966331269233">Tarun Vats</a>, the company has started internal testing for One UI 8.5. The new version carries the build number "YJH" and includes the October 2025 patch. The update is reportedly around 2GB in size, and while it remains only for internal testing, tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1981643152789217382">Max Jambor</a> gained access to it, revealing several features planned for the next major update.</p><p>Samsung has long been working on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-8-5-get-to-the-point-faster-ai-notification-summaries">AI-based notification summaries</a> feature for One UI. The feature, as the name suggests, would allow users to summarize "long messages" and show a brief preview in the notification panel. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheBrackard/status/1981670958810517540">spotted</a> by a user on X, the new One UI 8.5 build now adds this option in the settings menu.</p><h2 id="ai-summaries-and-priority-alerts-spotted-in-one-ui-8-5-2">AI summaries and priority alerts spotted in One UI 8.5</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xiHy9cTAzoy4K68pLbkuyB" name="one-ui-8-5-notification-summary" alt="One UI 8.5 running on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xiHy9cTAzoy4K68pLbkuyB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Max Jambor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The settings text reads, "Show a short summary for conversational notifications in English and Korean." It seems the feature will initially support only these two languages and work for conversation-related notifications. As per the text in the Settings, users will also be able to choose which apps show summarized notifications in app's settings.</p><p>The new One UI 8.5 build also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/maxjmb/status/1981699715961086290">adds a priority notifications</a> feature, which places important alerts at the top so you don't miss them. Similar to AI-base notification summaries, you will be able to set priorities within app notification settings.</p><p>Additionally, Tarun Vats <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1981615354750308623">revealed</a> that the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-already-chasing-one-ui-8-5-new-leak-spots-galaxy-s25-test">One UI 8.5</a> version has reduced or nearly removed the 3D look from icons.</p><p>Samsung hasn't yet begun public testing for One UI 8.5, but a beta release is expected soon. We'll keep you updated once Samsung rolls out the first beta build to the public.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Onyx Boox Palma</a> made a name for itself by being the first major phone-sized E Ink device, and now the second follow-up is flipping the script by adding a layer of color to that E Ink screen.</p><p>Powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/bigme-b1051c-pro-color-e-ink-tablet-impressions">the same Kaleido 3 E color Ink display</a> as many popular e-readers launched in 2025, the Boox Palma 2 Pro's phone-like form factor makes it the most portable color e-reader you can find. It weighs just 173g (that's quite a bit lighter than your average smartphone these days), yet the 6.13-inch display is big enough to comfortably read from.</p><p>The dual-tone frontlight makes it easy to adjust the color temperature throughout the day, and Boox's fast refresh technology plus the Android 15-powered OS means normal Android apps work perfectly. It also sports 5G connectivity, so you can pop a SIM card in and have a data connection wherever you're at — just be aware that it doesn't function like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-e-ink-android-phone-is-the-kindle-phone-ive-always-wanted">an E Ink phone</a>.</p><p>Impressively enough, the Palma 2 Pro also supports the InkSense Plus stylus for highlighting and quick notes, and the SIM tray doubles as a microSD card reader for expandable storage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V5eCferdEuLFjMCB7kcrCT" name="onyx-boox-note-air-5-c-official-lifestyle-black" alt="The black Onyx Boox Note Air 5 C on a white table with its stylus on top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V5eCferdEuLFjMCB7kcrCT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Onyx)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The second announcement comes in the form of a proper E Ink tablet called the Note Air 5 C.

Aside from a big upgrade to Android 15 (the Air 4 C launched with Android 13 earlier this year), the Air 5 C has a better keyboard case that attaches with handy magnetic POGO pins.</p><p>The writing experience has been upgraded as well, with a more textured surface that feels "more paperlike," according to Onyx, as well as an improved Pen3 stylus. The Boox Note Air 5 C also "mind mapping and AI-powered Smart Scribe tools" to make note-taking and organization easier.

This test is for the company's major Android 16 update headed for several of its devices. Today (Oct 24), Phone 3a and 3a Pro users will experience Nothing's UI visual overhaul. This change regards the icons users will see across their devices, as Nothing states has been refreshed to feel "lighter" and "more refined."</p><p>These changes aren't set in stone, as Nothing will use the Open Beta to gauge user feedback and make any necessary changes.</p><p>The other major feature rolling out with the Open Beta is "Lock Glimpse." With Lock Glimpse, Nothing says users will find "high-quality wallpapers to your lock screen, curated to your taste across nine categories." This feature in the beta is disabled by default; however, diving into Settings will let you quickly enable it. Once there, users can decide to toggle "Display on lock screen," a feature that will refresh your lock screen with a new, curated wallpaper every time you turn on your screen.</p><p>Users can also toggle "Left swipe to explore." If enabled, swiping left on your lock screen will surface a new "captivating" piece of lock screen content for you. Nothing states it has plans in the works to let users lean on their personal photos for Lock Glimpse. It also states that your privacy will be taken into account if you choose your own content over Lock Glimpse's curated assortment.</p><h2 id="phone-3a-gets-in-the-beta-2">Phone 3a gets in the beta</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="2KG7KRdoiJHD54XPjCQWJ4" name="nothing-phone-3a-series-open-beta-android-16" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a series enters the Android 16 Open Beta." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2KG7KRdoiJHD54XPjCQWJ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The final new feature in the Open Beta concerns the Phone 3a series' camera. The patch notes state that a preset, created in collaboration with photographer Jordan Hemingway, lets users "enhance photos" with deep shadows and extended highlights. This photo preset should bring about a new "cinematic" photo by the end.</p><p>If you're interested in joining the beta, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/45141-nothing-os-40-phone-3a-series-open-beta#:~:text=shortly%20after%20installation.-,How%20to%20join,-Make%20sure%20your">there are a set of crucial steps</a> you must take to get going.

The company upgraded its AI experience a little by adding a new dashboard that shows all active models, such as Gemini Flash, Whisper, and GPT-4o. Nothing even unveiled its "Extra Dark" mode, which turns dark elements fully black.</p><p>The flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-hype-android-16-phone-3-closed-beta-signups">Phone 3 entered a Closed Beta</a> for OS 4 in July, ahead of an Open Beta back in September.

Running Android apps, but it also understands your surroundings, and responds to you naturally through voice, vision, and gesture, and helps you manage tasks more intuitively.</p><p>As for the headset itself, according to Android Central's Senior Editor Michael Hicks, it feels <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">light and comfortable </a>to wear for a longer duration, imagine gaming or binging on your favorite Netflix show.</p><p>The Galaxy XR headset runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 platform, with 16GB of memory and a Micro-OLED display pushing 29 million pixels at up to 90Hz. The visuals are said to be sharp, immersive, and backed by immersive sound from a dual-speaker setup. It also tracks your head, hands, and eyes with precision using a mix of cameras and sensors.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-arrives-next-week-but-not-for-everyone-2">OnePlus 15 arrives next week, but not for everyone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RNDHdNYB8t85myGHxp9mhX" name="OnePlus15-SandStorm- edition" alt="OnePlus 15 Sans storm editions isn't all just the looks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RNDHdNYB8t85myGHxp9mhX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-worlds-wide-open-event-for-its-xr-project-moohan"><strong>here </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-isnt-getting-a-2k-display-but-dont-call-it-a-downgrade-just-yet"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>After a truckload of leaks and several teasers, OnePlus officially announced the launch date of its next flagship, the OnePlus 15. No, you didn't sleep through the OnePlus 14, since there won't be one (avoiding bad juju). The company has now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3871046669/Q9vvtEyI2" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> will launch in China on October 27. While we don't know when it will be released globally, several rumors suggest it could happen on November 13 this year, just two weeks after the China launch.</p><p>Additionally, the OnePlus Ace 6 will debut alongside it and is expected to launch globally as the OnePlus 15R. As for the flagship's specs, we know so far that it will feature a whopping 165Hz refresh rate, come in three colorways, and be powered by the latest and greatest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> chipset.</p><p>A recent rumor also indicated that the OnePlus 15 won't have a 2K display, with the phone instead switching to 1.5K resolution, which is a slight downgrade, but it could show up with thinner bezels.</p><h2 id="google-snuck-in-the-report-button-for-android-auto-2">Google snuck in the 'report' button for Android Auto</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4oTzHXaHGG4hWwCbg9YYKA" name="Android-Auto-Gemini-Messages" alt="Sending a message using Gemini on Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4oTzHXaHGG4hWwCbg9YYKA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/drivers-spot-an-android-auto-update-that-makes-it-easier-to-stay-informed"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Some Android Auto users took to a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidAuto/comments/1o8ipxg/report_option_now_available_on_smaller_screens/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target="_blank"> subreddit</a> to chat about the recent Google Maps update. The original poster states that the update finally made the app more accommodating for vehicles with smaller screens. It now shows the "Report" button in the app, allowing users to report crashes, police incidents, congestion, and more without having to use their phone.</p><p>Google seems to have made a few more changes to the interface, with some folks seeing a relocated Guidance Audio button. Users will find this option inside the app's settings. Additionally,  Android Auto's "suggested destinations" menu no longer expands when turned on for the first time. The user states, "The suggested destinations drop-down menu didn't expand, and when I tapped on it, it opened into the full-screen search/suggested destinations list." The update has started rolling out to users in phases since Oct. 21.</p><h2 id="galaxy-s26-series-may-not-launch-in-january-2">Galaxy S26 series may not launch in January</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qyEYgwM83FhJcV4rxp47AZ" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of Galaxy S26 Pro leak showcasing a slimmer design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qyEYgwM83FhJcV4rxp47AZ.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/when-will-samsung-launch-the-galaxy-s26-one-leaker-claims-itll-be-later-than-usual"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Samsung's next flagship series seems to have been caught in a chain of rumors for the past few weeks. This one comes from leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5224477353054299" target="_blank">Ice Universe on Weibo</a> (translated), stating that "the release of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series has been postponed." Samsung usually launches its flagship devices roughly in the second or third week of January; we don't know what led the tipster to note that the launch has been pushed.</p><p>However, another leaker, Instant Digital, also shared news of the rumored Galaxy S26 delay <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5224475520925890" target="_blank">on Weibo</a> (translated). They stated the delay could be because the company wants to "present it better to everyone, the release of the Galaxy S26 series may be postponed to March for release."</p><p>If these two leakers' claims about a Galaxy S26 delay pan out, we could be looking at a February 2026 or March 2026 launch, which is highly unusual for Samsung. But due to the rumored lineup shuffle and the potential of not seeing the ultra-slim <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">Edge next year</a>, anything seems possible.</p><h2 id="amazon-gives-us-the-first-look-of-of-its-smart-glasses-2">Amazon gives us the first look of of its smart glasses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TnJy4t4BzU4R7s9kTWAVhU" name="amazon-smart-delivery-glasses" alt="Amazon's AI smart glasses for Delivery Associates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnJy4t4BzU4R7s9kTWAVhU.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazon-testing-smart-glasses-with-delivery-partners"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Amazon officially revealed what its smart glasses could look like in action. In a blog post, the company said that these glasses are designed to support delivery associates to make deliveries "safer and more seamless." According to Amazon, they will allow associates to scan packages, follow turn-by-turn walking directions, and capture proof of delivery — all while their phones remain tucked in their pockets.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> are equipped with cameras, computer vision, and AI-powered sensing capabilities. They, however, differ from consumer-centric smart glasses and feature a fixed green monochrome heads-up display that shows the package details to the delivery associate within their field of view.</p><p>However, the glasses come with a small controller worn in the delivery vest and powered by a swappable battery for "all-day use." Amazon also says the glasses support prescription lenses and can automatically adjust to any light conditions.</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

If an agreement isn't reached, the platform states content from Disney, including ABC and ESPN, will vanish from its consumers' reach. Officially, YouTube states, "We've been working in good faith to negotiate a deal with Disney that pays them fairly for their content on YouTube TV."</p><p>Where things evolve is where the service adds, "Unfortunately, Disney is proposing costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers and give our customers fewer choices, while benefiting Disney’s own live TV products - like Hulu + Live TV and, soon, Fubo."</p><p>On the other side, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/disney-espn-youtube-tv-network-dispute.html">CNBC</a> reports that Disney has issued its own statement regarding the negotiations, as well as a new "public message" run, informing YouTube TV users about the ongoing process (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/24/youtube-tv-disney-channels-espn-abc-warning/">9to5Google</a>). A Disney spokesperson informed the publication that, "This is the latest example of Google exploiting its position at the expense of their own customers." It mentions that more than shows will disappear, as the NFL, NHL, College Football, and more will go alongside it.</p><p>We've entered crunch time, as YouTube TV and Disney have until October 30 at 11:59 pm ET to reach an agreement. If nothing is achieved, Disney's content will disappear. YouTube adds that <em>if </em>Disney's content is removed, and if it remains gone for an "extended period of time," it will grant subscribers $20 in credit.</p><h2 id="tense-situation-2">Tense Situation</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:999px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="zntMZ2xXoFHNXBCM5MTVuG" name="YouTube-TV-5-million.jpg" alt="YouTube TV hits 5 million subscribers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zntMZ2xXoFHNXBCM5MTVuG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="999" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube TV's been involved in some tense, down-to-the-wire negotiations to keep content on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv-nbcuniversal-dispute">platform before with NBCUniversal</a>. In 2021, there was the threat of viewers losing roughly 14 channels of NBCUniversal's content during the agreement renewal process with YouTube TV. These two got into negotiations again just recently, as CNBC reports, which wrapped up positively in September.</p><p>In February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/paramount-and-youtube-tv-finalize-deal-keeping-cbs-cbs-sports-available">YouTube TV and Paramount</a> had to hash out a new agreement to keep CBS and CBS Sports on the air for subscribers. This negotiation was a bit larger, as 30 channels were on the hook if this fell through.</p><p>This was essentially as public a struggle as we're seeing today with Disney. It was reported that YouTube TV and Paramount found difficulties in achieving a "fair deal." Things resulted well (in a way), as the two reached an agreement to keep the channels available for subscribers. However, shortly after, YouTube TV raised prices by $10 per month.</p><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>When is the deadline for YouTube TV and Disney to reach a new agreement?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The two sides have until October 30 at 11:59 pm ET to finalize an agreement.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Will my YouTube TV subscription price increase?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>YouTube TV has indicated that Disney's current proposition would likely result in the service having to raise prices for customers.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

But there's a huge barrier to entry that's going to require a lot of convincing for people to accept it: the price. At $1,799, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Samsung Galaxy XR</a> is expensive, no matter how you frame the argument.</p><p>On the bright side, it's half the price of the Apple Vision Pro while retaining many of that headset's best features, including a cutting-edge micro-OLED display, eye-tracking capabilities with iris biometric authentication, and more.</p><p>But at 3x the cost of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, is it really possible to justify the cost of Samsung's headset over Meta's?

Say you get home from work, have a nice dinner with your family, and then are ready to sit on the couch for some much-earned relaxing time... but your kids want to watch KPop Demon Hunters for the 346th time. No shade on KPop, but sometimes you need a break from the same old thing.</p><p>That's where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Galaxy XR</a> comes in. Pop this sweet headset on and you're instantly transported to the entertainment and relaxation <em>you</em> want, without having to fight over who is using the TV tonight.</p><p>It's your own TV, and you can do whatever the heck you want with it, even play those mature-rated games or watch HBO shows without your kids having to see or hear it before they're ready.</p><h2 id="better-for-work-2">Better for work</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-floating-windows-chrome-official" alt="Three floating windows in an Android XR mixed reality environment with Chrome in the middle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've used a lot of smart glasses over the years, and while some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> offer incredible ways to give yourself a personal theater (see the above section), their field of view is limited.</p><p>Take <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a>, for instance. The screens in those glasses offer a 50-degree FoV, while Xreal One Pro ups that to 57 degrees. That's impressive for smart glasses, but the Samsung Galaxy XR offers a 109-degree FoV. That's <em>double</em> the field of view, and it means your workspace looks like real life through the Galaxy XR's lenses rather than through a small window.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="b25Ee4cvFzaByJVywx5Kbf" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-workspace-official" alt="A man wearing a Samsung Galaxy XR interacting with floating windows using his hands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b25Ee4cvFzaByJVywx5Kbf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="676" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When you're using apps or working with your headset on, this wider field of view truly matters. The experience feels like you're sitting at a desk with monitors that you can move around at will, kind of like Tom Cruise in Minority Report. The difference here is that your windows aren't restricted to a 2D plane; you can move them <em>anywhere</em> you want in space.</p><p>Not to mention the fact that Android XR supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-secret-sauce-behind-samsungs-galaxy-xr-headset">every single Android app</a> on the Google Play Store, so you're not going to be worried about missing that important app you use every day. That makes Galaxy XR massively more appealing for work, especially when comfort is involved.</p><p>While it's a long way from the diminutive weight of smart glasses, Galaxy XR's headset design mimics my favorite productivity headset, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Meta Quest Pro</a>, taking all the weight off your face and making it easy to eat and drink while wearing it.

Ironically, the optional Galaxy XR controllers are now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/high-demand-wipes-out-galaxy-xr-controllers-hours-after-launch">backordered into December</a> because owners clearly want to game on this thing.</p><p>And why not? Android XR supports the OpenXR standard, which means developers can port their existing Meta Quest games to Galaxy XR with relatively little work if they use the OpenXR API. But don't just take my word for it, here's what the developers of Walkabout Mini Golf had to say:</p><p>"Android XR was a medium difficulty port, mainly because the game was written before things like OpenXR was well supported, so there were a few systems that had to be replaced with newer standards. It's good housekeeping for a game like ours to keep our tech stack up to date and ports like this are part of that practice.” — Lucas Martell, CEO of Mighty Coconut</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioCCn_qrbuo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Gaming on a Galaxy XR isn't just about native VR games. You can play <em>any</em> Android game on Galaxy XR on a giant, resizable screen, so no more squinting down at your phone trying to read the text in Stardew Valley or trying to snipe across the map in Fortnite.</p><p>And Galaxy XR's incredible eye, hand, and face tracking technology all transfer to your PC when you use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=virtualdesktop.android">Virtual Desktop app</a> from the Google Play Store. This means that you can play amazing SteamVR games like Half-Life: Alyx or jump into the wide world of Resonite or VRChat and get full facial tracking capabilities to enhance your social skills.

They're not small and portable like a phone, and the UI and lack of built-in physical keyboard make them difficult to recommend as a laptop replacement.</p><p>But last year, when my power was out for two weeks after Hurricane Helene, I found that the Honor MagicPad 2 tablet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/these-gadgets-got-me-through-the-worst-hurricane-of-my-life">was the perfect replacement</a> for my laptop because of the battery life. This year, Honor is taking that usage to heart, upgrading the MagicPad 3 with a giant 13.3-inch screen that rivals the best laptops.</p><p>This large size and included stylus also make it perfect for artists who want a digital canvas without investing $1,200 in a similarly sized iPad Pro. But the tablet's massive size makes it awkward for most other tasks, limiting its general-use potential. Over the past few weeks, I've been putting this tablet to the test in every way I can find, and I've narrowed its usefulness down to three categories.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

While Android as a laptop OS still has awkward limitations compared to Windows, Honor's MagicOS skin feels more like a laptop OS than ever.</p><p>That starts with a new default window-management function that launches everything in resizable windows rather than full-screen monstrosities. Pair this with the ability to minimize windows to floating icons that can be moved anywhere on the screen, plus a quick way to launch several apps in four pre-made split-screen templates, and it's easy to see why this feels more like a desktop OS than ever.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div

The tablet now magnetically adheres to the case and is far simpler to remove and place into the case than before. The keyboard has an extremely comfortable layout that felt native to me the second I started typing on it.</p><p>Unlike some other tablet keyboards I've used, there was no adjustment period for me using it. It felt almost identical to my Honor MagicBook Art 14 laptop, which was refreshing. Even the trackpad mouse is fantastic and feels like a proper laptop mouse. My one critique is that the taskbar <em>still</em> cannot be pinned. This was a huge oversight last year, and I really hope Honor adds it in the MagicOS 10 update.</p><h2 id="multimedia-powerhouse-2">Multimedia powerhouse</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Wz8dbeG2hjXxN2ZXzjF2ag" name="honor-magicpad-3-stylus-games" alt="Playing Gorogoa on an Honor MagicPad 3 using the included stylus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wz8dbeG2hjXxN2ZXzjF2ag.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Last year's Honor MagicPad 2's speakers were incredible and made watching downloaded videos and movies in the dark evenings (without power) after the Hurricane a joy.</p><p>This year's speakers are somehow even better, offering incredibly full sound, notable bass, and truly impressive virtual surround sound. More than once, I actually felt like I needed to look around to find the invisible speakers I knew weren't floating around my head.</p><p>It also has a bigger display than last year, making it more enjoyable to watch a movie, binge a TV show, or catch up on the latest episodes of your favorite manga or webtoon.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EwrjeSpZL2k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The problem is that the display is worse in some ways, despite the size upgrade for this purpose. I'm not someone who thinks OLED is inherently better than LCD for a number of reasons, but many people prefer OLED for a more "premium" experience because of the punchy colors and deep contrast it offers.</p><p>The 165Hz LCD panel on this tablet is quite good, especially for an LCD, but it looks duller than the Honor MagicPad 2's OLED panel. The backlight is fully flicker-free according to my testing, but the display makes a huge mistake by trying to fake a 10-bit color palette on an 8-bit panel.</p><p>This is done through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-users-have-had-just-about-enough-of-temporal-dithering" target="_blank">color dithering</a>, a tactic that causes splitting headaches for some people.

It could also be excellent for anyone who just loves to draw or doodle — adults and kids alike — as the canvas is so massive and lies nicely and flat on a table, especially if it's in a case.</p><p>That said, I think sticking with something smaller makes sense for most people. There's certainly room for big tablets in the world (see what I did there?), but I've not found many in my own time with the MagicPad 3. I think the MagicPad 2 is still the better buy because of its size and display, both of which you won't be disappointed in.</p> ]]></dc:content>

T-Mobile is officially closing the popular loophole, and the change is effective starting October 24, 2025.</p><p>T-Mobile has officially ended a long-standing workaround that allowed some customers to score the $5 per-line AutoPay discount while still paying their bills with a credit card. As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tmo.report/2025/10/t-mobile-ends-credit-card-autopay-loophole/" target="_blank">The Mobile Report</a>, users who prepay their bills using ineligible payment methods will lose their AutoPay discount for that billing cycle.</p><p>The change puts an end to a payment workaround that many savvy subscribers had been using to enjoy both T-Mobile’s monthly discount and credit card perks like cash back or travel points.</p><p>Previously, customers could set up AutoPay with a debit card or bank account to qualify for the discount, but then pay their bill early with a credit card. The system would still show an eligible payment method and apply the discount, even though the actual payment did not qualify.</p><h2 id="t-mobile-s-system-now-catches-you-2">T-Mobile's system now catches you</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1990px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T" name="T-Mobile-Store.jpeg" alt="T-Mobile store sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1990" height="1119" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>T-Mobile is now tightening its billing logic to ensure the discount only applies when the actual payment is made with an approved method. The company says customers who prepay their bill partially or in full using a credit card or another unsupported option will automatically forfeit the discount for that month.</p><p>The policy has been in place since 2023 when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-t-mobile-phones">T-Mobile</a> officially excluded credit cards from AutoPay eligibility, but this recent update closes the technical gap that made the loophole possible. Affected customers will start receiving text notifications informing them that their AutoPay discount has been removed for the upcoming billing cycle.</p><p>To keep getting the $5 per-line discount, customers must use a debit card or bank account as their payment method and avoid making early payments with a credit card. If you prefer paying with a credit card for the rewards, you’ll need to decide whether those perks are worth giving up the recurring discount.</p><p>For families or multi-line plans, losing that $5 per line can quickly add up, potentially costing an extra $20 or more each month, depending on the number of lines on the account, as pointed out by one subscriber on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1oebrsa/comment/nl14pdh/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>.</p><p>For now, there’s no indication that T-Mobile plans to extend credit card eligibility again, so if you want to keep saving on your bill, sticking with a debit card or bank account is the only way to go.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I've used several cameras over the years, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/this-dongle-sized-thermal-camera-is-astonishingly-good">Thermal Master's P2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/this-fluke-dongle-brings-a-thermal-camera-to-your-android-phone">Fluke iSee</a>. The latter is interesting because it's made by a brand that's known for its industrial tools, and in did a good job in my usage.</p><p>Not to be outdone, Thermal Master rolled out the P3, which is arguably the best thermal camera dongle you can get today. The dongle connects over USB-C, and I didn't have any issues using it with my Galaxy Z Fold 7 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>. The P3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-Master-P3-Imaging-Camera/dp/B0FF4YFCS9">retails for $299 on Amazon</a>, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thermalmaster.com/products/thermal-master-p3-pcb-master">costs the same on the brand's website</a>. If you're buying via Thermal Master's site, you get an additional 10% off by using code <strong>Android10</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KQ9SLffcmPKq3CbgSiEzsS" name="Thermal Master P3" alt="Thermal Master P3 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KQ9SLffcmPKq3CbgSiEzsS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The P3 is considerably bigger than its predecessor, but even then, it weighs just 26g, and is easily portable anywhere. It comes in a hard shell case that gives the dongle additional protection, not that it needs it — it is made out of aluminum, and build quality is great.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Nn78sdEWxikz6p4Uennf9T" name="Thermal Master P3" alt="Thermal Master P3 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nn78sdEWxikz6p4Uennf9T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This doesn't make any difference to its usability, but I like that the P3's design has gold accents. The IR camera has a resolution of 512×384, and it is a definite upgrade over the Fluke iSee, which does 256x192. You also get a wider range of color palettes, and you get manual focus as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PX7L8RojafBoykbG7xH5FT" name="Thermal Master P3" alt="Thermal Master P3 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PX7L8RojafBoykbG7xH5FT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The camera is useful if you need to identify hotspots, or in my case, see just how hot a phone gets while running a game, and where that heat is going.

The most noticeable change is the new icons, which are now bigger and more rounded.

Several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> users on Reddit have reported seeing a mysterious question mark(?) instead of the percentage.</p><p>This issue seems to be cropping up for users who have wireless chargers, particularly third-party or non-Qi2 certified chargers, but this is still speculation(as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://piunikaweb.com/2025/10/23/some-pixel-10-pro-fold-users-are-seeing-a-question-mark-on-the-battery-icon/">Piunika Web</a>).

Some say it could be an underlying hardware issue, like the battery failing, while others believe it's a simple UI problem that a quick fix could resolve.  One user even said that "A lot of this has been happening since the last play security update. I suspect it will come out as just a bug, but you're smart to reach out to Google to see what they recommend."</p><p>That said, it isn't just the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold facing these issues; some<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelFold/comments/1nv5sqz/pixel_9_fold_battery_question_mark/"> 9 Pro Fold users </a>also seem to have spotted the weird '?' icon next to their battery, where one user stated that the error message they got was "Unable to read battery meters".

Only time will tell. But for now, if you're seeing this issue, a temporary fix, all you have to do is to reboot the phone, which returns the correct battery percentage. If you still don't see it fixing this bug, you should contact Google Support for further guidance or a possible warranty claim.</p><p>Google's spokesperson also confirmed to Android Central that rebooting the device will resolve the issue; however, "Pixel 10 Pro Fold users should use certified Qi2 wireless chargers."

The patent infringement case was first filed by Strava against Garmin on Sept. 30 in the U.S. District Court for Colorado. As of Oct. 21, Strava submitted a court filing to dismiss the suit entirely.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/10/strava-drops-voluntarily-lawsuit-against.html" target="_blank">DC Rainmaker</a>, the filing signals Strava is abandoning its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/strava-sues-garmin-over-live-segments-and-heatmaps">patent infringement case against Garmin</a>, which centered around heat maps and live segments. At the time, Strava requested a permanent injunction on the sale of Garmin watches and bike computers that it claimed used its patented technology.</p><p>The case never materialized further as Strava pulled the lawsuit before the two companies had the chance to state their positions before a judge. “Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1)(A)(i), Plaintiff Strava, Inc., by and through its undersigned counsel, voluntarily dismisses the above-captioned action, without prejudice," the succinct court filing states.</p><p>Garmin and Strava appeared to have a close relationship before the lawsuit, with Garmin data being a key part of Strava's platform. It's unclear how the two companies will interact going forward, or what may have transpired behind the scenes. Either way, it looks like Strava's aggressive move against Garmin is coming to a quick end.</p><h2 id="how-strava-and-garmin-got-here-2">How Strava and Garmin got here</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BAMRnLTQkKJsxq6dissQVX" name="Strava-Performance-Predictions-vs-Garmin-Race-Predictor" alt="The Strava app showing Performance Prediction times for the author's current condition for 5K, 10K, half marathon, and full marathon races, with a Garmin Fenix 8 draped above the bottom-right of the phone showing a different marathon prediction time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BAMRnLTQkKJsxq6dissQVX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Strava's dispute with Garmin not only transpired via court filings, but also in public. Matt Salazar, the chief product officer at Strava, made a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1nw8u98/setting_the_record_straight_about_garmin/" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> titled "Setting the record straight about Garmin" shortly after Strava's lawsuit was first filed. The post criticized Garmin's developer guidelines for API partners, which as of July 1 required the Garmin logo to appear on content including its data.</p><p>"Unfortunately we could not justify to our users complying with the new guidelines," Salazar wrote. "As such, we have tried to resolve this situation with Garmin over the course of the past five months, including proposing additional attribution across the platform in a less intrusive way, but to no avail."</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava/comments/1nw8u98/setting_the_record_straight_about_garmin">Setting the record straight about Garmin</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Strava">r/Strava</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>In the post's replies, many Strava users criticizing the move, stating that they likely wouldn't pay for or use the platform without Garmin data and integrations. Others called out Strava's comments as being hypocritical, as it has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html" target="_blank">a similar API policy</a> that stops other apps from displaying Strava data or using it for AI features.</p><p>The short legal battle came as Strava is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/fitness-tracking-app-strava-looks-hire-banks-ipo-2025-09-17/">prepping an initial public offering (IPO)</a>, possibly as soon as next year. The dispute put Strava front-and-center in wearable news for a few weeks, but it's unclear whether the dropped litigation attempt could help or hurt its eventual IPO.</p><p>In a completely separate case, fitness watch brand <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/we-unpack-the-strava-garmin-suunto-lawsuit-situation-and-what-it-means-for-your-watch">Suunto also sued Garmin for patent infringement</a> this month. Strava's dismissal has no effect on the Suunto/Garmin lawsuit as a result, and it's safe to assume that case is still ongoing until we hear otherwise.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The operating system, based on Android 16, builds off the One UI 7 overhaul while adding new features and doubling down on Galaxy AI. Now, Samsung is bringing the One UI 8 update to the Galaxy S21 FE — and it's likely going to be its final major Android OS upgrade.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s21-fe-last-major-one-ui-update-released/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> first spotted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> rollout for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe">Samsung Galaxy S21 FE</a>, which began Thursday, Oct. 23 for users in Thailand and Vietnam. There's no word on when the rollout will reach other areas, but this initial update release signals that One UI 8 is on the way globally for the Galaxy S21 FE. According to the report, the update is over 2GB in size — relatively small for a major OS upgrade — and comes with version <strong>G990EXXUIHYJ2</strong>.</p><p>Samsung's rollout pace appears to be quicker than usual for the Galaxy S21 FE. Like many Galaxy phone models, the Galaxy S21 FE received Android 15 later than expected. It only received the boost to One UI 7 back in May 2025. One UI 8 now quickly replaces it as the newest software version only a few months later.</p><p>To check for the update, open the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Galaxy S21 FE and tap the <strong>Software update</strong> tab. Then, press <strong>Download and install</strong> and <strong>Install now</strong> to load up One UI 8 when it is available. If you're not in Thailand or Vietnam, expect to wait a bit for Samsung to seed the update in more regions.</p><h2 id="will-the-samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-get-any-more-updates-2">Will the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE get any more updates?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="grZX6TH96s2PbQtRJHyTVN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S21-FE-display-sunset.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S21 FE homescreen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/grZX6TH96s2PbQtRJHyTVN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The quick One UI 8 rollout should be welcomed by Galaxy S21 FE owners, but it may be their last major Android update. Samsung first launched the Galaxy S21 FE in January 2022 with a four-year OS update promise. One UI 8 marks the fourth full Android OS upgrade the phone has received, and the Galaxy S21 FE will turn four years old in a few months. As such, we don't expect the Galaxy S21 FE to get Android 17.</p><p>However, the phone is set to receive security updates for another year after its OS upgrade guarantee ends in January 2026. Looking ahead, newer Galaxy FE phones won't lose support as quickly. Starting with the Galaxy S24 FE and continuing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 FE</a>, these "Fan Edition" phones come with a lengthy seven-year update promise.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company has now clarified that it plans to release GPU driver updates for the Pixel 10 lineup to improve performance.</p><p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-10-gpu-update-3609497/">Android Authority</a>, Google confirmed that monthly and quarterly system updates for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a> will continue to bring GPU improvements. The company said the September and October patch releases already contained GPU driver enhancements. "In future releases, we are planning further GPU driver updates," it told the publication.</p><p>Google switched to TSMC for the Pixel 10 series' <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5 chipset</a>, which should have theoretically brought major improvements. While heating has reduced compared to the previous generation, the overall performance gains on the Tensor G5 aren't substantial.</p><h2 id="gpu-driver-updates-could-boost-pixel-10-s-gaming-performance-2">GPU driver updates could boost Pixel 10's gaming performance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qhL8MhFK6Htm5sxwCCuB3b" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-system-update-01" alt="Getting a system update on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qhL8MhFK6Htm5sxwCCuB3b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some users have recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nzjp5f/pixel_10_can_barely_handle_genshin_impact_as_gpu/">reported</a> that the Pixel 10 struggles to handle games like Genshin Impact, with noticeable lag and freezing. Thankfully, Google plans to release GPU driver updates that could deliver much-needed graphics performance improvements.</p><p>For context, the Tensor G5 chipset on the Pixel 10 uses Imagination Technologies' PowerVR DXT-48-1536 GPU, which offers up to 1.5 TFLOPS FP32 performance (on paper). However, the Pixel 10's performance still trails behind phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>That's partly because the Pixel 10 ships with outdated GPU drivers. Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nca8ln/pixel_10_gpu_is_a_mess/">Reddit users</a> discovered that the Tensor G5 uses version 24.3 of the driver, which doesn't support Android 16.</p><p>And even though Imagination Technologies has already released version v25.1 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16">Android 16</a> and Vulkan 1.4 compatibility, Google has yet to update the Pixel 10's drivers. That could explain why the Pixel 10 lags behind other flagship Android devices in gaming performance.</p><p>It's possible Google's statement about upcoming GPU driver updates refers to these newer versions, though the company hasn't provided a timeline. Unfortunately, even the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-rolls-out-bootloader-fix-in-android-16-qpr2-beta-3-1">Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3.1 update</a> doesn't include these driver updates for the Pixel 10 series, so we might have to wait a bit longer for meaningful improvements.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the company’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-6-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-6s-gen-4-mobile-platform" target="_blank">product overview</a> of the chipset, the new Kryo CPU is up to 36% faster, and the Adreno GPU delivers a 59% improvement in graphics, making it a strong choice for multitaskers and mobile gamers.</p><p>This translates to smoother app launches, quicker responses, and better gameplay, all with lower power use. The platform supports 144Hz FHD+ displays. Gamers will benefit from features like Variable Rate Shading and Game Quick Touch, which improve efficiency and touch response, making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phones</a> feel closer to gaming flagships.</p><h2 id="pro-level-camera-support-2">Pro-level camera support</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hWWDBi7Bh5uYB933eCub5V" name="Infinix-Note-40-Pro-Plus-5G-07.jpg" alt="Infinix Note 40 Pro Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hWWDBi7Bh5uYB933eCub5V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the camera side, Qualcomm didn’t hold back. Like the Snapdragon 6 Gen 4 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomms-new-snapdragon-chip-is-about-to-make-mid-range-phones-way-better">unveiled earlier this year</a>, the Snapdragon 6s Gen 4 supports up to 200MP photo capture and 2K video recording, with triple image signal processors (ISP) for more versatile shooting setups. It also uses Multi-Frame Noise Reduction (MFNR) to improve clarity in low-light shots, making photos sharper and cleaner.</p><p>With the Qualcomm Spectra ISP, users get enhanced HDR, improved color accuracy, and smoother autofocus. These features were once only found in high-end devices.</p><p>Connectivity is also much better. The built-in Snapdragon X62 5G Modem-RF system works with both sub-6GHz and mmWave bands, offering download speeds up to 2.9Gbps. The chip supports Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.4. With Qualcomm AI Engine, users get smarter camera features, better voice recognition, and real-time improvements to photos and audio.</p><p>On paper, the Snapdragon 6s Gen 4 pushes the 6-series line into new territory, making advanced features that were once reserved to the top Android phones more accessible than ever. Qualcomm hasn’t confirmed which phones will debut with the chip yet, but brands like Xiaomi, Motorola, and OPPO are expected to adopt it soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature concerns uploaded images to Gemini, which users would typically do to receive information about the subject matter. However, what the tipster states is that there is the ability to "circle" or otherwise highlight a specific area on that photo for the AI.</p><p>The feature is very similar to Android's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, which allows users to circle a screenshot and run a Search query about it. For Gemini, the tipster discovered that the AI can explain what the image is, but it also can think for itself and identify what's been circled without user input.</p><p>In the tipster's example, it seems Gemini will mention the screenshot as a whole before focusing on the content you've highlighted. The AI then gave a brief explanation of what the user selected to hopefully fulfill any questions they may have. The tipster also mentions that Gemini can lean on Google's AI image software (Nano Banana) to "remove" the highlighted/circled part of an image.</p><p>For right now, it seems we might be waiting on this feature to arrive (if it ever does). As the post points out, it's not entirely integrated in Gemini, as the menu to circle imagery is pretty barebones.</p><h2 id="one-feature-inspires-another-2">One feature inspires another</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="XdXT3qv9MSomGg7pttyj9M" name="google-gemini-circling-image-specifics" alt="A screenshot of Gemini's "circling" feature for specific portions of an image, which was reportedly spotted in development." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XdXT3qv9MSomGg7pttyj9M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">refining its Circle to Search experience</a> this year, which started around the time the Galaxy S25 series launched.

Google said AI Overviews in CtoS includes places, trending images, and more visual search queries.

There are two significant changes with this alleged Moto foldable, and both concern its external appearance. The biggest change, according to the uploaded WIPO illustrations, is the Razr's cover display, which is no longer square.</p><p>The drawings in question claim that this particular Razr foldable may not feature a squared cover display, but rather a circular one, centered, and against its right side frame.</p><p>It's difficult to discern in the imagery, but it seems that this circular cover display won't be as immersive as one would like. There appears to be a thick border (bezel, if you will) around its circumference. The next supposed change deals with the phone's camera array, which tacks on one more lens for a triple, vertical array.</p><p>It's hard to fathom Motorola switching up its design like this, especially after the traction the Razr series has gained with this large cover display (across its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">base and Ultra models</a>, too). It's worth taking such a leak like this with a grain of salt, as this may not come to pass.</p><p>However, as the publication theorizes, this design could be for an alternative, perhaps even "cheaper" Razr in the future.</p><h2 id="for-now-don-t-hold-your-breath-2">For now, don't hold your breath</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:836px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.77%;"><img id="6zQT7BvRjKaK9hUc8F3AjJ" name="motorola-razr-future-alleged-design-patent" alt="An alleged illustration of a potential future Motorola Razr with a circular cover display against its right side and a vertical camera array within the housing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6zQT7BvRjKaK9hUc8F3AjJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="836" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XpertPick)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If we walk back time a little to earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">when the 2025 Motorola Razr trio launched</a>, it'd become evident the alleged design and what we have conflict. The company revealed a Razr, Razr Plus, and Razr Ultra, each with an immersive cover display that spans the majority of its external top. It allows users to have a wide array of functions without opening their phones, like watching YouTube videos, texting, and more.</p><p>If we're chasing the more "affordable" angle with the alleged patent discovery, seeing it as an outside variant <em>could </em>be viable. The smaller, circular display wouldn't be as useful as what would be the flagship's cover, but there might be some potential there.</p><p>We'll have to see what Motorola leans toward next year, as it has been pushing and focusing on its foldables even more, advancing its hardware and AI capabilities.</p><p>On a shimmering note, Motorola's Razr 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-brilliant-razr-2025-buds-loop-swarovski-collaboration-shines-launch">had a collab with Swarovski crystals</a> in August, bringing a fashion-forward, glimmering design.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the publication, these cameras are stalling right out of the box, during the setup process between them and your phone. The post states that the Onn cameras are freezing on the "Activating" stage in the Home app.</p><p>It seems as though this issue is quite persistent, often failing and forcing the user to begin the setup process all over again. Users have reportedly mentioned this as a recurring problem; however, the publication identified an issue with updating the devices, which also fails.</p><p>Elsewhere, on Reddit, users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1nzq4pj/comment/njvybuf/">on the Google Home subreddit</a> have started reporting frustrating issues beyond the initial setup stages.

They state that, in the app, all that appears is the "request contains invalid argument" (something went wrong) screen.</p><p>They state that they've "factory reset and deleted the home," but the issue persists.</p><h2 id="the-expansion-s-issues-2">The expansion's issues</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1nzq4pj/just_got_my_onn_indoor_wired_camera">Just got my onn indoor wired camera</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome">r/googlehome</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Others <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1nzq4pj/comment/njwlyvj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">are having difficulties</a> accessing their "24/7 recording" content. The user states they've obtained the appropriate subscription for the feature, yet it won't surface. Some users have had varying success with factory resetting their devices, but it hasn't been consistent.</p><p>As far as the inaccessible settings go for the Onn cameras, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1nzq4pj/comment/nkf3n0z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">one user detailed</a> a set of step-by-step instructions that worked for them.

The first key update involves Google merging its Eart AI models with Gemini. The post states this upgrade should make it possible for researchers to "instantly find objects and discover patterns from satellite imagery." Some use cases include predicting sandstorm occurrences and even monitoring available drinking water in a given area.</p><p>However, Google states that merging Earth AI's models and Gemini will arrive first as a test for U.S. users "in the coming weeks." Google Earth Professional and Advanced users will get their hands on it when this finally debuts.</p><p>What users can sink their teeth into today (Oct 23), so long as you're a Google AI Pro or Ultra subscriber, is a "higher limit" in Google Earth, courtesy of Gemini.</p><p>Earth's AI imagery is headed to Google Cloud, alongside Population and Environment models for Trusted Testers.</p><h2 id="understanding-our-world-2">Understanding our world</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpeI9dbkWho" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The Earth is complex, and the questions researchers and analysts have are getting a major boost with Gemini in this update, too. Google states that its Geospatial Reasoning technology now leans on the AI model to "connect" multiple Earth AI models to answer tougher questions. Soon, researchers can combine weather forecasts, population maps, and satellite imagery to answer difficult questions with data about community vulnerabilities and disaster responses.</p><p>Similar to Gemini's "deeper insights" update for Google Earth, this Geospatial Reasoning update is headed for Google's testing grounds.

They're both powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 9500 platform, get the same storage variants, have a similar-sized 6.78-inch AMOLED panel, same ultrasonic fingerprint modules, and a big battery.</p><p>They even share the same 50MP Sony LYT-828 main camera and 50MP Samsung JN5 wide-angle modules, and a 200MP telephoto lens — albeit one that's slightly different, with the Find X9 Pro featuring the Samsung HP5 module (Vivo uses a custom HPB sensor). Heck, OPPO even has a telephoto extender this year, which is similar to what Vivo provides on the X300 Pro.</p><p>Although there are many hardware similarities, these devices aren't identical to use — far from it. Vivo and OPPO clearly diverge when it comes to their camera tuning, and that was immediately evident when I started using the Find X9 Pro. The software is refreshingly different as well, even if both phone makers chose to "borrow" iOS 26's translucent effects.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rEnj2pkAWgFVbFbzbgbaGM" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rEnj2pkAWgFVbFbzbgbaGM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anyway, back to the cameras. OPPO is using a new Lumo camera engine, with the brand noting that it overhauled its imaging algorithms to deliver cleaner and more detailed photos. Interestingly, it's designed to shoot 50MP stills as standard, able to eke out much better quality. Video quality is improved as well, and the phone is now able to shoot 4K120 Dolby Vision footage — albeit with the main camera and tele lens (wide-angle is limited to 4K60).</p><p>Let's get to the photos. Predictably, the Find X9 Pro does a fantastic job in just about any lighting scenario, delivering detailed photos with good dynamic range and color accuracy. OPPO says it worked closely with Sony and Hasselblad to tune both the sensor and its imaging algorithms this year, and there is a noticeable difference in the resultant image quality over the Find X8 Pro.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span

This is one of the key reasons why I used the Vivo X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro so much over the course of 2025, and I'm glad to see both brands making positive strides with portrait mode on their latest devices.</p><p>Then there's the <del>telephoto extender</del> err, detachable zoom lens. OPPO went with a similar system as Vivo, but annoyingly, attaching the zoom lens covers up the entire camera island, so you can't use any other lens when it's in use. This isn't a limitation on the X300 Pro, and OPPO should consider tweaking the design with the next generation. The detachable lens does a great job extending the zoom range, and the resultant image quality is similar to that of the X300 Pro. But the associated hassle means I didn't use it anywhere as much as its Vivo sibling.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="v5QePMG2Tqd3PD85cqLSVM" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v5QePMG2Tqd3PD85cqLSVM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I still think Vivo has the overall edge with the cameras; I prefer the brand's image tuning and color science, but it's solely a matter of choice.

That's changing now, with the phone maker confirming that it will use a 1.5K BOE display on the device.</p><p>At an initial glance, that may seem like a downgrade from the 2K panel used on the OnePlus 13, but OnePlus' Li Jie Louis <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405222115321446526">took to Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gadgets360.com/mobiles/news/oneplus-15-display-resolution-downgrade-reason-specifications-features-9502611">Gadgets 360</a>) to clarify a few things. Basically, OnePlus wanted to increase the refresh rate to 165Hz on the phone, and that wasn't possible with a 2K panel. So instead of going with the standard 120Hz display, OnePlus chose to "upgrade" the panel.</p><p>The display is still made by BOE, and it should get the usual extras that have been a mainstay on OnePlus phones these last two years, including DC dimming and good color vibrancy. Although the panel resolution is lower, Louis indicated that the display is costlier this time.</p><p>Honestly, this isn't an issue. Having used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a>, I can't tell the difference between a 2K and 1.5K panel in regular use, and I like that the phone maker is instead offering higher refresh — that's something you can actually notice. In a similar vein, the phone has thinner bezels this time, and goes down to 1nit at night; these are tangible gains that make a difference in regular use.</p><p>Also, while OnePlus says this was done to switch to 165Hz, the real reason might have to do with its BBK siblings. Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">Vivo X300 Pro </a>and Find X9 Pro use 1.5K panels as well, and at the X300 launch event in Shanghai, Vivo talked extensively about how it partnered with BOE to set up a production line catered to its devices.</p><p>This is just conjecture on my part, but I believe the Find X9 Pro and the OnePlus 15 use a similar panel, and it wouldn't have been feasible to switch to a 2K resolution just for one device — which doesn't sell anywhere as much as its OPPO and Vivo siblings.</p><p>Anyway, the result is that the OnePlus 15 will have a 1.5K panel, and it shouldn't be an issue. If anything, it may even have better battery life on account of not having to drive quite as many pixels, and I'll take that any day over infinitesimal gains in resolution.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company states that this new AI button will appear at the top of search results when users are looking for a new smartwatch, clothes, or anything. "Help me decide" gets specific, offering its assistance when users are searching for similar products to their initial search, but haven't made a purchase.</p><p>The post adds that "help me decide" leverages Amazon's LLMs and AWS services "to understand what you need and why by looking at your shopping history and preferences." The AI does a little more work by surfacing the product's details to help inform your decision and digging through customer reviews to further that research.</p><p>When searching for products, users will notice a "help me decide" button at the top right of the results with golden stars. After tapping the button, the AI will run through its processes and finally deliver its result: a singular product recommendation. The AI will surface the product's image, name, rating, price, a brief description from the product's creator, and its AI-compiled "Customers say" box.</p><p>This is what's known as a "Top Pick" within the AI's new feature. However, if you're unsatisfied, Amazon states you can tap two other options: Budget Pick and Upgrade Pick, to see what else is possible.</p><h2 id="amazon-continues-to-bring-speed-with-ai-2">Amazon continues to bring speed with AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="bwJU9Lf68VefG7cbDVk5iA" name="amazon-help-me-decide-top-pick" alt="Amazon's new AI feature, "help me decide," will connect users with products that they may be interested in, producing its image, title, rating, price, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bwJU9Lf68VefG7cbDVk5iA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon states "help me decide" is now available for users on Android and iOS in the app, as well as those shopping in mobile browsers. It states you can check if you have the feature by heading into "Keep shopping for" at the top of the app.</p><p>This feature is in a similar vein <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon/amazon-buy-for-me-ai-agentic-test-start">to a test Amazon ran</a> earlier this spring. The company rolled out an AI test called "Buy for me," which allowed users to grant permission to the AI to purchase a product for them, without much manual input. It arrived for a limited group of U.S. testers and appeared when searching for products in the app. In short, tapping "buy for me" would let the AI immediately run through the usual payment processes, such as name, address, and card information.</p><p>It was an agentic test that leveraged Amazon's Bedrock AI software to handle everything for the user.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Buttons have to be at least 10ft/3m apart, but the trick is that you just need to walk that distance. It doesn't have to be a straight line.</p><p>I asked developer Thomas Van Bouwel about it, and he told me, "So, e.g., if you have a master bedroom with two nightstands, putting the buttons on the two nightstands and walking around the bed is valid." Remember, since the Meta Quest is a wireless VR console, you don't have any wires or cords to trip over, so you can go ham with the playspace size and shape.</p><p>The action begins fairly simply, with the first few levels involving static lasers that stay in one place, making it easy to get into character and slink your way around each laser to get to the end. As you can tell from the video above, those lasers don't stay in place for long, becoming much more like a traditional video game as you progress.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CJu9LkE6PVENDcVGSeumme" name="LaserDance_Screenshot_04" alt="Mixed reality gameplay of a man dodging laser in Laser Dance while wearing a Meta Quest 3S headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJu9LkE6PVENDcVGSeumme.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vanbo BV)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've had access to the game for a few days now and can call it another huge win for Vanbo games. If you're not familiar with the name, this is the same developer behind the uber-popular puzzle game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cubism-vr.com/">Cubism</a>, which is on every VR platform from the Meta Quest to the newly minted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Samsung Galaxy XR</a>.</p><p>Plus, at just $9.99, it's nearly impossible to pass up. This might be called "early access," but it's got over 18 levels to play, all of which scale with your room size and shape and has over 80 laser patterns. That ensures even the same levels feel different when you play them in another room or home!</p><p>And if you've got some accessibility needs, don't worry, the game caters to a wide variety of players with significant adjustments where you might need them.

It sports a 10.9-inch LCD display (the lack of an OLED screen is part of why it's so much more affordable), as well as a large 8,000mAh battery, which Samsung says will get users up to 20 hours of battery life per charge. It also has a microSD slot for added storage, as well as IP68 ingress protection, Android 15, and a durable build quality that users like.</p><p>You can also purchase a first-party keyboard case for the S10 FE, though it's sold separately.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499.99" data-dimension48="$499.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Processor-Note-Taking-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0DVZYQT3T" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FLGRKLCi3NCGSTAP4LenpM" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-render-square" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FLGRKLCi3NCGSTAP4LenpM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="394" height="394" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE (128GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Processor-Note-Taking-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0DVZYQT3T" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499.99" data-dimension48="$499.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$499.99</del> <strong>$399.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon is currently offering the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE for $100 off, marking a 20% discount.

It offers a cheaper price point than premium tablets in Samsung's repertoire, though it still comes with the first-party S Pen.

Still, the S10 FE also has a microSD port that allows for up to 1TB of expandable storage. Performance is backed by the Exynos 1580 processor and 8GB of RAM, while the device also has IP68 water and dust resistance.</p><p>If you don't mind going with a downgraded LCD screen and you do want a tablet with an S Pen, this deal might be a good opportunity to save $100.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What's included in this deal?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The deal gives a <strong>$100 discount</strong> on the Galaxy Tab S10 FE (128GB model) via Amazon, bringing the price down to about $400 with no trade-in or other prerequisites.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What are the key specs of the Galaxy Tab S10 FE?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>A 10.9-inch LCD display (rather than OLED).</p><p>An 8,000mAh battery with Samsung’s claim of up to ~20 hours of use.</p><p>It features 128GB of internal storage and includes a microSD slot (expandable up to 1TB).</p><p>Comes with the first-party S Pen stylus. </p><p>IP68 water & dust resistance.</p><p>Powered by an Exynos 1580 and 8GB RAM.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Is this a good tablet for students?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Yes, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE is positioned as a top pick for students because it offers an S Pen and strong battery life at a more affordable price point. However, if you need features such as an OLED display, higher refresh rate, or premium-tier performance, you might want to consider a higher-end model.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Are there any drawbacks or things to consider before buying?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The display is LCD rather than OLED, so contrast and black levels won’t be as strong as premium tablets. If you want a really high refresh rate (e.g., 120Hz) or flagship-level performance, this model might fall short due to the Exynos chip and only 8GB of RAM. Finally, the deal is for the 128GB version; double-check which storage size you’re purchasing and ensure it's enough for your needs.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

This means that AI will become the primary feature on a phone, pulling information from apps to give users a more intuitive and personalized experience.</p><p>Much like how you can ask <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini</a> to summarize the recent emails from your manager about the 'Q4 marketing campaign' and add a task to your to-do list to draft a follow-up presentation for next week, Gemini will pretty much accomplish these tasks without much of your intervention. But this is still Gemini interacting with Google's apps. Now imagine if it could do the same with the rest of the apps on your phone?</p><p>In the future, AI will essentially function as the brain of your phone, with apps serving as its neurons, all working together to help you accomplish tasks. For instance, you could say, "Hey Google, could you plan my dinner for tonight, send me a shopping list of ingredients, and then book an Uber for 5 pm so I can get supplies right after my Pilates class?" and then simply observe as everything falls into place.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/euRgJMKNN78" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/exclusive-how-ai-will-transform-our-relationship-with-technology">IDC experts told Android Central in an exclusive report</a> that the existing App ecosystem will be forced to adapt. But if these models do change, how will AI determine which specific app to use for a given task? For example, if apps like Expedia or Airbnb are not installed, will the AI prioritize an app based on user history, performance, or a paid partnership? Here's what could likely happen.</p><p>"Strategic partnerships between service providers, phone makers, and AI platforms are likely to be formed, and we can expect this kind of integration to become more common over the next five years as AI matures and becomes ubiquitous across devices," IDC notes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yrkDUTqnrTUEAknS32XnEC" name="Gemini-Top-Free-App-iOS" alt="Gemini listed as the top iOS app with a Pixel in the background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yrkDUTqnrTUEAknS32XnEC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>App developers and companies may not like the idea of losing autonomy over their products. "Many will resist handing over control to AI platforms, fearing the loss of direct engagement and brand identity, and will try to maintain their own ecosystems and monetization strategies over the next few years," the firm added.</p><p>Ultimately, businesses that effectively use AI will thrive because people these days want things to happen quickly and on the go. And those who resist this change might be caught in an uphill battle. This switch in the overall business model could also let AI act as a filter, and could potentially change the need for users to interact with these apps directly.</p> ]]></dc:content>
