<p>Amazon has introduced three new Fire HD 8 tablets, all souped up with better performance and some slick generative AI capabilities.</p><p>Amazon’s new Fire HD 8 lineup includes the Fire HD 8 (2024), Fire HD 8 Kids, and Fire HD 8 Kids Pro, all loaded with handy generative AI features. You’ll find a writing assist feature built right into the keyboard to help you polish up your writing. Plus, the Amazon Silk browser can now whip up quick webpage summaries, and there&apos;s an AI tool that lets you create custom wallpapers just from a text prompt.</p><p>Starting later this month, Amazon’s AI features will also be available on various compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Fire tablets</a>, the company said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-fire-hd-8-tablets-gen-ai-hd-entertainment" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>True to its name, the new Fire HD 8 features an 8-inch display with a 1280 x 800 resolution. A standout upgrade in the 2024 model is the addition of 3GB of RAM in the base 32GB version, while the 64GB model gets a bump to 4GB of RAM.</p><p>While these specs aren’t revolutionary for a budget tablet, they’re a noticeable step up from the 2GB of RAM found in the previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-8-2022-review">Fire HD 8</a> (2022 model), representing a 50 to 100 percent improvement.</p><p>The tablet also sports an improved rear camera, though it sticks to a modest 5MP resolution. Amazon claims it can last up to 13 hours on a single charge, which is the same as the previous model.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Fire HD 8 Kids and Fire HD 8 Kids Pro are designed for different age ranges—Kids is for little ones aged 3 to 7, while Pro is meant for kids 6 to 12. They both come with a two-year warranty that covers those inevitable mishaps. Plus, you’ll snag a 12-month subscription to Amazon Kids+ with your purchase.</p><p>Each of the three models comes in its own set of fun colors. The Fire HD 8 (2024) will be available in Black, Emerald, and Hibiscus. The Fire HD 8 Kids has options like Blue, Disney Pixar Cars (red and yellow), Disney Princess (pink and purple), and Grape. Lastly, the Fire HD 8 Kids Pro will feature colors like Discovery (teal and blue), Hello Teal, Jungle Cat (purple and blue), and Marvel Avengers (black and red).</p><p>Usually priced at $100 with lock-screen ads, the Fire HD 8 is now on sale for just $55 as part of the October Prime Day event. The Fire HD 8 Kids tablet, which typically costs $140, is also marked down to $70 for Prime Day.</p>

A lot of it is done in-house — Samsung designs its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy phones</a> and decides how everything is going to fit together then supplies a sort of framework for every piece, both hardware and software. Many of the pieces that make it actually work though, come from someone else and had to be licensed.</p><p>Using a product without the proper licensing agreements can lead to problems, something that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-another-patent-dispute-germany-report">OnePlus is learning about right now</a>.</p>
<p>Licensing and other assorted legal issues sound like some super boring part of making a phone. That may be so (I think it&apos;s really interesting), but even if that&apos;s true, it&apos;s still one of the most important parts. Without the proper licensing, both the hardware inside the phone and the software that powers it wouldn&apos;t exist.</p><p>Licensing refers to the permission to use a company&apos;s technology as a part of your product. It can be free, or it can be paid, and a court can even force it so one company doesn&apos;t get an unfair advantage. When done the right way, we never think about it and only really know it exists if we judiciously read through the terms and conditions flashed on the screen the first time we use something. When done the wrong way, it&apos;s news on every tech website because it could mean a product ban.</p><p>It&apos;s possibly the most important part of making a product.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1761px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.85%;"><img id="U3YNXfHjuU7LqSwpzCkPSF" name="qualcomm-5g-mmwave-momentum.png" alt="Qualcomm 5G mmWave Momentum" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U3YNXfHjuU7LqSwpzCkPSF.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1761" height="737" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hardware inside your phone, tablet, earbuds, and everything else uses plenty of parts bought or licensed from elsewhere. It&apos;s something all companies do because it&apos;s something all companies need to do. A manufacturer that makes something as complicated as a phone usually isn&apos;t also in the business of designing, testing, authenticating, producing, and licensing network technology, for example. </p><p>Take Apple or Samsung; both companies build products that we can buy and those products have parts the company also builds inside of them. They also pay licensing fees to companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-x35-launch">Qualcomm</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/corning-interview">Corning</a> because they are using physical products developed by those companies. The same goes for Google. Just because you make a product and the chip inside of it doesn&apos;t mean you made everything.</p>
<p>Software works the same way, and this is one of the things you are probably pretty familiar with but don&apos;t know because you use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth earbuds</a>.</p><p>No matter if you use an iPhone or an Android phone, listening through a set of quality earbuds means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aptx-vs-aptx-hd-whats-difference">Qualcomm</a>, Sony, and other companies must be involved. There is no need for anyone to tell you about the software itself or to announce that it&apos;s using tech from another company, but without it, your Bluetooth would sound like it did 10 years ago.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:77.13%;"><img id="TbiTF7BHgUnrDcMdAV5dGV" name="Bluetooth-menu-LDAC-codec.jpg" alt="Close-up screenshot showing LDAC codec in Bluetooth settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbiTF7BHgUnrDcMdAV5dGV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="833" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sony is also a great example of how licensing technology doesn&apos;t always mean money changes hands — it gives the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">LDAC audio codec</a> it developed away for free to Google so it can be included in every Android phone. The tech is still patented and belongs to Sony, it&apos;s just free to use. </p>
<p>And while OnePlus is once again in the thick of it with more licensing issues, we&apos;ve seen the same thing from Samsung, Motorola, and every other company, as well as from Apple and Google. Just because you&apos;re the "big dog" doesn&apos;t mean you get to use whatever you like without asking.</p><p>We&apos;ve even seen companies forced to license their tech by the courts in the interest of fairness. A company might charge exorbitant fees or refuse to license technology so it has some sort of advantage. Apple famously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2019/04/qualcomm-and-apple-agree-drop-all-litigation">refused to pay for tech from Qualcomm</a>, which it had used to force the issue in court because it felt that Qualcomm should have to play more fairly in this space.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1503px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="VMZA4yM4ndYgafPHDxwYUj" name="Corning-Gorilla-Glass-Victus-2-phone.jpg" alt="A phone with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the ground" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VMZA4yM4ndYgafPHDxwYUj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1503" height="846" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Corning)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>None of this is a selling point for a product like a phone. In fact, companies usually don&apos;t mention much of it because they like to create the illusion that they&apos;ve done all the magic themselves. You might know your phone uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Corning Gorilla Glass</a> but had no idea it also uses firmware licensed from Broadcom. As long as it works and Broadcom gets paid, you didn&apos;t need to know and it only becomes important when things go wrong and a judge gets involved. </p><p>In a perfect world, ideas could be freely shared and all corporations worked together to make what&apos;s best for us all. In the real world, there&apos;s more than one way to be successful, and through licensing, we get the best tech that&apos;s out there in one product.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp now lets you pick filters like warm, cool, prism light, and fisheye with a new update.</li><li>Similarly, the update includes backgrounds like blur, office, and living room, amongst seven others.</li><li>These new filters and backgrounds will be rolling out to WhatsApp users in the coming weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like, in the coming weeks, your conventional WhatsApp video calls could be more engaging as the messaging platform is introducing new filters and backgrounds, WhatsApp announced.</p><p>According to the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/introducing-filters-and-backgrounds-for-video-calls">announcement post</a>, users will be able to apply filters and change backgrounds for video calls on WhatsApp, which may add a personal touch. The filters are believed to generate a playful atmosphere for users as they can add "a splash of color" or create a "more artistic feel" during video calls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ptueRMTeYCgAfbxGTuUfkg" name="whatsapp-filters.jpg" alt="WhatsApp new filters and backgrounds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ptueRMTeYCgAfbxGTuUfkg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp/ Mark Zuckerberg)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Backgrounds, on the other hand, aim to keep users&apos; actual background space private and replace it with a cozy coffee shop or a cool-looking living room.</p><p>WhatsApp notes that it is adding ten new filters and ten different backgrounds for users to choose from. For filters, they can choose from "Warm, Cool, Black & White, Light leak, Dreamy, Prism light, Fisheye, Vintage TV, Frosted glass, and Duo tone. "</p>

<ul><li>A discovery in the latest Google Messages beta shows the company could bring full RCS support to Wear OS devices.</li><li>Such support would let LTE and Wi-Fi smartwatches send RCS texts without relying on the connection between it and your phone.</li><li>Wear OS 5 recently started arriving for the two past-gen Pixel watches, but was cut off due to a crippling issue.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google might look to give its Wear OS software a much-needed upgrade for its messaging experience.</p><p>A look into the recent Google Messages beta (v20240926), lines of code suggests Wear OS could pick up full RCS messaging support. The discovery was made by known X tipster AssembleDebug in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/wear-os-standalone-rcs-messages-apk-teardown-3486475/">Android Authority</a>. Several newly added strings of code in the beta beginning with "bugle.enable_wear" mention new "standalone" support.</p><p>The post states this "standalone" addition regards RCS, RCS settings, and voice messaging.</p><p>Unfortunately, the initial discovery is extremely light on sufficient information. The tipster couldn&apos;t uncover the look of the RCS settings on Wear OS nor could they test this support. Google is likely still deep in development for tying Wear OS-ready watches to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a> servers through the Messages app.</p><p>Speaking of the RCS servers, this is exactly the issue, as noted by the publication. Wear OS devices "can" send RCS texts, but this relies on its connection with your phone — even LTE models. However, if Google proceeds with its development of proper RCS on smartwatches, users could send and receive such texts without relying on their phones.</p>

<p>What&apos;s also unclear is how soon Wear OS users expect this RCS update. Wear OS 5 arrived on the Pixel Watch 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-5-september-2024-update">recently started rolling out</a> on the two past-gen devices in the series. The update includes bug fixes and a few new updates for Pixel Recorder functionality, a new grid-view app launcher, and upgraded camera controls. However, the update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-problems-force-pause">was shut down due to crippling issues</a> plaguing some users.</p><p>Concerning RCS, we may have to look forward to a future Android drop including something for Wear OS users to sift through.</p><p>RCS is a messaging standard Google has been pushing and incorporating across devices for a while now. The company has even urged its competitor, Apple, to do the same while citing the positives RCS brings. The standard keeps media quality high, ensures our group chats remain stable, and noteworthy E2EE (end-to-end encryption) to our conversations.</p><p>Apple also finally gave in and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-ios-18-adds-rcs-support-android">brought RCS support to the iPhone</a> via its iOS 18 update in September. While the patch brought its functionality, iPhone users communicating with Android still lack a crucial aspect: E2EE.</p>

<p>The Pixel Watch 3 comes in and makes good on what users felt Google could've gotten better with the Pixel Watch 2. Google upgraded this watch with a better battery that should take you a little more than a day. More importantly, Wear OS 5 packs loads of new features and a refreshed experience that (hopefully) continues.</p></p>

<h2 id="when-is-the-next-prime-day-2">When is the next Prime Day?</h2>
<p>The next Prime Day sale event — officially known as Big Deal Days — is set to kick off on October 8th and run through October 9th. Just like the July sale, you can expect hundreds of great deals on everything from tech to furniture and appliances, with the majority of discounts being exclusive to Prime members. </p>
<h2 id="what-meta-quest-deals-can-i-expect-during-big-deal-days-2">What Meta Quest deals can I expect during Big Deal Days?</h2>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S is still in its preorder period, and there was recently a significant price drop on the Quest 3, so it&apos;s hard to know if Amazon will discount the devices further once the sale goes live. Meta tends to do its own thing during Prime Day, but at the very least, you can expect many of the best Meta Quest accessories to receive major discounts during the sale. </p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-big-deal-days-2">Do I need to be a Prime member to shop during Big Deal Days?</h2>
<p>Yes, the majority of discounts featured during Big Deal Days will be exclusive to Prime members. If you haven&apos;t joined yet, the good news is that Amazon offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>30-day free trial</strong></a> so you can explore all of the benefits of a Prime membership for a month without paying a dime. After the trial period, you&apos;ll be billed $14.99 per month, so be sure to cancel before the trial is over if you don&apos;t want to pay. </p>

<hr>
<p>Epic Games is taking its crusade for third-party app stores to Google (again) and Samsung.</p><p>The latest lawsuit reportedly concerns Samsung&apos;s "Auto Blocker" feature on devices running One UI 6 and up. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/9/30/24256395/epic-sues-google-samsung-antitrust-auto-blocker">The Verge</a>, the feature is turned on by default on Galaxy devices, preventing users from downloading/installing "unauthorized" apps. This extends to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/epic-games-store-arriving-on-android-later-this-year">third-party app stores</a>, too, to which Epic states there is "no process" for an outside party to "authorize" itself.</p><p>Epic&apos;s CEO Tim Sweeney states, "the thing’s not designed to protect against malware, which would be a completely legitimate purpose. The thing’s designed to prevent competition."</p><p>The Verge contacted Samsung for confirmation about Auto Blocker&apos;s functions, which it neither confirmed nor denied. However, Samsung spokesperson Chris Langlois stated, "contrary to Epic Game’s assertions, Samsung actively fosters market competition, enhances consumer choice, and conducts its operations fairly."</p><p>The gaming company reportedly approached Samsung to create a "whitelisting" process for Auto Blocker. This would&apos;ve relieved the strenuous "21-step process" awaiting users looking to get around the automatic safety feature. Talks fell by the wayside and now Epic has delivered a draft of its 42-page lawsuit against Samsung <em>and </em>Google.</p><p>The latter is wrapped in this because of its alleged antitrust practices against third-party stores similar to Samsung. What&apos;s more, Epic purports that Samsung colluded with Google to create its Auto Blocker feature — but there&apos;s no proof.</p><p>Regardless, Google has denied such allegations. Its head of security for Android, Dave Kleidermacher stated, "Google did not request that Samsung create their Auto Blocker feature."</p><p>The publication reports that Epic is seeking a jury trial once again. Additionally, Sweeney states this fight, like its initial battle with Google, is for "all developers, not just Epic."</p>

<p>Epic&apos;s fight against Samsung regarding its anti-competitive "Auto Blocker" isn&apos;t new as the company&apos;s CEO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-games-is-protesting-samsungs-anticompetitive-practices-but-users-are-the-ones-losing">voiced his displeasure</a> over the summer. Sweeney played a similar tune to its earlier fight with Google stating in a tweet, "this change obstructs users from installing competing stores..."</p><p>Epic was able to parade around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-loses-antitrust-court-battle-against-epic">a victory against Google</a> in its antitrust case about the Play Store in December 2023. A jury unanimously agreed that Google&apos;s Play Store operated as a monopoly and employed antitrust practices against other developers. The start of that battle was the result of Epic adding its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-considered-acquiring-epic-games-due-fortnite-storefront-controversy">own payment system</a>, namely for purchasing V-Bucks for Fortnite.</p><p>During the hearing, it was stated that the Play Store was responsible for "95% of Android downloads." Seen as "dominance," Epic stated Google played rough with developers and smartphone makers who may have challenged them. The latter denied such theories, stating its stronghold benefits users.</p><p>As The Verge also noted today (Oct 2), this victory verdict for Epic in 2023 didn&apos;t involve "Unknown Sources" or third-party apps/stores. With this newfound lawsuit narrowing its scope for both Google and Samsung, Epic might find itself back in the courtroom.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is making Gemini Nano more accessible, a game-changing AI model built to run directly on devices, cutting out the need for an internet connection.</p><p>Before this expansion, Gemini Nano was only available for Google’s own apps. Originally launched on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> in December 2023, it later became available on Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series.</p><p>However, this exclusivity didn’t last long, as Google has recently extended access to Xiaomi devices, signaling a major step towards wider adoption.</p><p>Alongside its own apps, Google granted a select group of external partners early access to the on-device AI model, though their contributions are yet to be revealed.</p><p>Google has now made a significant move toward the broader adoption of Gemini Nano by allowing Android developers to experiment with the model through the AI Edge SDK via AICore on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series, as detailed in a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/10/gemini-nano-experimental-access-available-on-android.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>Currently, Google is allowing developers to experiment exclusively with text-to-text prompts. This opens up opportunities for exploring applications like rephrasing, smart replies, proofreading, and summarization within the Gemini Nano framework.</p><p>Future updates for Gemini Nano are expected to introduce support for various modalities, including images, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-nano-will-roll-out-to-pixel-8-users">expand compatibility to a broader range of devices</a>. Mishaal Rahman, writing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/what-phones-support-gemini-nano/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>, has pointed out potential candidates for this compatibility, including the Xiaomi 14T, devices from Motorola and Realme, as existing Nano-compatible devices from Samsung.</p><p>Although this experimental access allows developers to explore Gemini Nano, it’s important to note that it is strictly for development purposes and not meant for production environments. Developers can access Android AICore (Beta) by joining the AICore system through the Play Store.</p><p>This broader compatibility will enable developers to integrate Nano into their third-party apps, giving them a major AI boost. This could lead to a whole new wave of AI-powered apps hitting the Play Store.</p>

<hr>
<p>Disney has been priming users worldwide for a password-sharing crackdown on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a> streaming service, and that is now officially underway. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/paid-sharing-disney-explainer/" target="_blank">blog post</a> last week, the company outlined its plans to entice account sharers to pay their own way for the service. Part of that effort includes making it clear that, like Netflix, Disney Plus is only intended to work within one household.</p><p>"Your Disney+ subscription is meant to be used within your Household, which is a collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside there," Disney says in the post. </p><p>People outside your household "will need to sign up and pay for their own subscription or be added as an Extra Member to your account for an additional monthly fee to continue enjoying Disney+." </p><p>Many of the policies Disney is now rolling out were piloted in select markets around the world this summer. They&apos;re intended to increase Disney&apos;s streaming revenue, either by forcing password sharers into buying their own plan or pushing account owners to add a paid extra member. Disney&apos;s streaming arm lost money for years, but was profitable for the first time during Q3 2024, when an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2024/08/q3-fy24-earnings.pdf" target="_blank">earnings report</a> revealed that the company generated $47 million in revenue across Disney Plus, Hulu, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-watch-espn-plus-tv-phone-roku-online">ESPN Plus</a>. </p><p>Disney looks to keep that momentum going with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-paid-sharing-enforced-us-launch">the new Extra Member plans</a>, which are available for the Disney Plus Basic and Premium tiers. Subscribers can add a person outside of their household to their plan for an extra $6.99 for Basic plans or $9.99 for Premium plans. At the moment, you can only add one extra member to a plan, and extra members aren&apos;t supported for the bundle that includes Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus. </p><p>The options are widely rolling out for subscribers in the U.S., Canada, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. If users don&apos;t want to add an extra member, they can port a user profile to a new Disney Plus account, as long as it&apos;s not a minor account or a Junior mode account. </p><p>Luckily, there are options for when you&apos;re traveling or relocating. If you get a warning that Disney Plus detects you&apos;re away from your household, you can tap "I&apos;m away from home" or "Update household" to keep watching. This will send a one-time password to the account owner&apos;s email for verification. It&apos;s unclear if any long-term restrictions will be put in place to prevent password sharing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a>, like Netflix&apos;s requirements, which make you connect to a home Wi-Fi network every month. </p>
<h2 id="how-the-new-password-sharing-policies-hurt-families-2">How the new password-sharing policies hurt families</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="XRSDcCBmjPYZU23zJH2oqP" name="Disney-Plus-Hulu-hero.jpg" alt="Disney Plus and Hulu icons side by side on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XRSDcCBmjPYZU23zJH2oqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Disney and Netflix&apos;s actions in the password-sharing crackdown represent a departure from how the services industry has typically treated family plans. Most subscription services, like Apple iCloud Plus or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one" target="_blank">Google One Premium</a>, give you a set number of accounts you can share purchases or benefits with. Steam Families, which lets you share games and media purchased on Steam, works the same way. </p><p>Apple, Google, and Valve let you share content with a set number of accounts, no matter where they&apos;re located. Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">streaming services</a> are throwing this conventional notion of family sharing out the window. Disney and Netflix call their plans for the "household," but they&apos;re really for the property or residence. Families and households take a variety of forms, and members aren&apos;t always living in the same location.</p><p>Netflix and Disney don&apos;t care about that. In fact, they would prefer if multiple family members had to pay for their services. They&apos;ve neared the peak of their revenue streams and want more. If most families already have a Netflix or Disney Plus subscription, how do these companies continue to grow? The answer is: try to break those families up. </p><p>Take me, for example. I live in Arizona, and the rest of my family lives on the U.S. east coast. Most of my family lives together most of the time, but some of my siblings are in college. I was in school not too long ago. It seems crazy for myself (especially when I was still a full-time student), my siblings, and my parents to all have separate subscriptions. This is just my immediate family I&apos;m talking about. </p><p>But that&apos;s exactly what Disney and Netflix want. As a consumer, my first response to these policies is simple: who are Disney and Netflix to tell me where and how I can use the subscription I&apos;m paying for? Especially when prices continue to go up year after year.</p><p>It&apos;s pushing me, and many others, to ditch streamers altogether. I&apos;m only subscribed to one streaming service, Paramount Plus. I love it, but I&apos;ve been completely disenfranchised by the others. In a way, Disney and Netflix&apos;s crackdowns have worked; I don&apos;t share accounts for their services anymore, but now I don&apos;t use them at all.  </p>
<h2 id="these-moves-only-do-one-thing-push-people-toward-piracy-again-2">These moves only do one thing: push people toward piracy again</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.50%;"><img id="fikXNA3gkgeZeuyAz359XW" name="netflix-spotify-curb-piracy-hero.jpg" alt="Netflix TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fikXNA3gkgeZeuyAz359XW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="532" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The elephant in the room here is piracy. Yes, piracy is illegal, and you really shouldn&apos;t do it. But piracy was rampant in the 1990s and early 2000s before digital music stores like iTunes started popping up. Sites like Napster were ubiquitous for sharing pirated content. The piracy seemed to stop when it was easy to buy media, either through individual online purchases or all-encompassing subscriptions. </p><p>When it&apos;s easy to pay for media legally, consumers have proven over decades that they&apos;ll certainly do it. However, the market has also learned the hard way that users will absolutely pirate content when companies and studios make it difficult to obtain licenses and stream content lawfully. </p><p>As we enter the late stage of the streaming wars, where account sharing is null, digital rights battles remove content from services on a monthly basis, and price hikes happen on a yearly basis, I&apos;m worried the media industry could be making things difficult enough that consumers resort to other ways of obtaining content. </p>

<ul><li>OnePlus China head Li Jie Louis showcases BOE's upcoming display, which will likely be used for the OnePlus 13.</li><li>The display will likely measure 6.82 inches and be curved on all sides.</li><li>The OnePlus 13 is also rumored to launch soon after this month's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 is revealed.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The OnePlus 13 is expected to launch later this year, and while leaks have been surfacing online, the company has shown off what will likely be the phone&apos;s display.</p><p>OnePlus China head Li Jie Louis <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7582893032/OzfthEWo2?pagetype=profilefeed">has teased</a> a new BOE display, which is believed to be the company&apos;s BOE X2 screen. In his recent Weibo post (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/09/front-side-of-oneplus-13-possibly-shown-by-boe.html">Android Headlines</a>), the representative shared and image and more details about the quad micro curved display and what we can expect from it (and likely the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.07%;"><img id="Wh8grZUqniyxeaS88oVGWE" name="OnePlus-13-BOE-X2-display.jpg" alt="OnePlus 13's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wh8grZUqniyxeaS88oVGWE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="690" height="518" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Li Jie Louis/ via Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It will presumably be slightly curved on all sides, which isn&apos;t that easy to comprehend through the shared image of the panel. Otherwise, it looks like a conventional centered punch-hole display at first glance.</p><p>The curved display also means we might expect a near-bezel-less display, which also seems to be the case with the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-magnetic-charging-leaked-camera-module">OPPO Find X8</a> series from OnePlus&apos; sibling company—although that phone will seemingly have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-series-to-sport-narrow-bezels">flat screen</a>.</p>
<p>Android Headlines further notes that the curved display will measure 6.82 inches diagonally and have a 2K resolution. Users should also remember that the previous iteration of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> display was also sourced by BOE, and it turned out to be outstanding in terms of brightness and streaming HDR content.</p><p>Qualcomm&apos;s upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a> chipset will likely power the OnePlus 13, with the chip set to launch later this month at the Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii. As rumored, we are expecting the OnePlus 13 to launch sooner this year, starting with the Chinese market, probably right after the flagship chipset release.</p><p>Speaking of, the upcoming chipset has been spotted in multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-hits-benchmark-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4">benchmark test leaks</a> over the past few weeks. It also includes a OnePlus handset, presumably the OnePlus 13, and the single-core and multi-core results turned out to be promising.</p>

<p>But when it comes to charging my daily driver phones, I&apos;m starting to rely on wireless charging stands more and more. It&apos;s just convenient to use a wireless charger, and while the downside is that you don&apos;t get much in the way of speeds — they don&apos;t exceed 15W — that&apos;s more than adequate when using iPhones and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-was-wrong-about-the-pixel-9-pro-xl">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p><p>I used UGREEN&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-100w-2-in-1-desktop-charger-review">Nexode 100W MagSafe charging stand</a> in the past, but I switched over to Satechi&apos;s offerings earlier in the year, and they&apos;ve been phenomenal. Satechi makes some of the best charging accessories and hubs, and I use the brand&apos;s products throughout the house.</p><p>When Satechi announced it was coming out with Qi2 chargers, I was obviously interested. There are two products in the series — a 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand that can be used to charge your iPhone, Apple Watch, and earbuds at the same time, and a 2-in-1 stand that charges the iPhone and earbuds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k3SF9GezfrdKNSSQavdtsa" name="satechi-qi2-charging-stand-11.jpg" alt="Satechi Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand back view with iPhone 16 charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k3SF9GezfrdKNSSQavdtsa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both charging stands are made out of metal, and they do a great job powering up all of my Apple products. The rubber feet at the bottom ensure the stands don&apos;t move around on a desk, and the build quality is easily the best of any charging stand I used up to this point.</p>

<p>What I like the most about either charger is that they&apos;re ideal for travel; they fold down flat, and that makes them easy to carry on the road. While I haven&apos;t gotten back to traveling just yet, the 3-in-1 charging stand combined with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-pro-gan-chargers-launch">Nexode Pro 160W GaN charger</a> would be the ideal combination to use on the go.</p>

<p>The 3-in-1 wireless charging stand in particular is great; it comes with a bundled 45W charger with travel plugs for the EU and U.K., and it charges my iPhone 16 Pro Max at 15W alongside my smartwatch. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aEUT9ESjXM429HXDpM2YxZ" name="satechi-qi2-charging-stand-7.jpg" alt="Satechi Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand with smartwatch charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aEUT9ESjXM429HXDpM2YxZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, the ability to charge my Apple Watch along with my phone is a big deal; I usually have to lug a cable around just for the smartwatch, and not having to do that is a relief. While I don&apos;t wear earbuds regularly — my go-to choice is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze MM-500</a> — I used the stand to charge earbuds I&apos;m testing, and there were no issues in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mLdxSn65LUHXeLGtMqWdwX" name="satechi-qi2-charging-stand-6.jpg" alt="iPhone 16 and iPhone 15 charging on the Satechi Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mLdxSn65LUHXeLGtMqWdwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like other charging stands, you can use StandBy Mode on the iPhone 16 to view the clock while the device is charging, or set up a digital photo frame. Both stands charged my iPhone 16 Pro Max at 15W, and there were no issues with overheating.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S4anKnfH5KzGbFKcmrKH9X" name="satechi-qi2-charging-stand-4.jpg" alt="Satechi Qi2 Wireless Charging Stands with magnetic connections" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S4anKnfH5KzGbFKcmrKH9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Qi2 standard is interesting because it uses 15W as standard, and all chargers need to have magnets to ensure a strong seal with phones. While Satechi&apos;s wireless charging stands are aimed for use with iPhones, I routinely charge my Pixel 9 Pro XL with it, and it does just as good a job, albeit limited to 12W as Google doesn&apos;t offer Qi2 on its devices.</p>
<p>I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thinborne.com/collections/pixel-9-pro-xl-case">Thinborne&apos;s excellent case</a> with my Pixel 9 Pro XL, and the case has built-in magnets that create a good seal with Satechi&apos;s charging stand. You&apos;ll ideally need to use a case with your Android phone; all the devices I tested without a MagSafe case just slid down the stand and weren&apos;t able to secure a connection. </p><p>On that note, Android devices still don&apos;t have Qi2 yet — that should change in 2025 —  and we should see additional products in this category once the likes of Samsung and Chinese manufacturers integrate the standard. </p>

<p>The 3-in-1 charging station is available for $129, with the 2-in-1 option going for $79. Of the two, I&apos;d recommend getting the 3-in-1 option; the Apple Watch charging puck is a big differentiator, and it&apos;s just convenient to charge three devices at once. If you don&apos;t use the Apple Watch and just want a charging stand instead, the 2-in-1 option is a good value. </p><p>Satechi didn&apos;t leave anything out here, and if you need a reliable Qi2 wireless charging stand, these should be at the top of your list. </p>
