According to reports, there will be two variants, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/oneplus-turbo">Android Headlines</a> has now published images of the lower-powered model.</p><p>The device shown is said to carry the codename "Prado" and follows a familiar design language seen on recent OnePlus phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-12">OnePlus 15</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/no-limits-the-oneplus-15r-empowers-android-users-with-flagship-performance-huge-battery">OnePlus 15R</a>. It features a rectangular camera module in the top-left corner housing dual cameras. The phone appears to have a glossy back with a blue-greenish finish, though it's unclear whether the material is plastic or glass.</p><h2 id="this-new-oneplus-phone-is-built-around-a-massive-battery-2">This new OnePlus phone is built around a massive battery</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AMDv7uUETBPC57jbG8gkdL" name="oneplus-turbo-1" alt="Leaked images of OnePlus Turbo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AMDv7uUETBPC57jbG8gkdL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e2riSrKtePmqBNXDG5pNdL" name="oneplus-turbo-2" alt="Leaked images of OnePlus Turbo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2riSrKtePmqBNXDG5pNdL.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Unsurprisingly, the phone looks noticeably thick, which makes sense given the massive 9,000mAh battery inside — larger than what you'll find in some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/holiday-walmart-android-deals-last-chance-2025">Android tablets</a>. Despite its size, the design remains fairly minimal, especially when compared to more aggressive-looking gaming phones from brands like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic/redmagic-just-dropped-a-gaming-phone-with-a-literal-water-cooler-inside">RedMagic</a>.</p><p>As for specifications, this variant is said to pack the full 9,000mAh battery along with support for 80W fast charging. On the front, you're looking at a 6.8-inch 1.5K display with a 144Hz refresh rate. Powering the device is the Snapdragon 7s Gen 4 chipset, paired with 8GB of RAM, while the higher-end variant could come with the more powerful Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, as previously rumored.</p><p>Android Headlines also suggests that OnePlus plans to launch the phone outside China, potentially under the Nord branding, though it may skip a U.S. release altogether. Considering no Nord-branded phones have launched in the U.S. in recent years, that seems plausible.</p><p>As for timing, OnePlus is reportedly targeting a Q1 2026 launch, which means we could see the device debut around MWC 2026 in March.

You can always make a new account and set up forwarding, so that emails sent to your old account land in your new inbox, but there is currently no easy way to change your Gmail username itself. That finally looks set to change.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/PixelHubUpdates/4453">Google Pixel Hub on Telegram</a>, a recently updated Google Account <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/19870?dark=0&sjid=13129471057818824497-NA&hl=hi#zippy">support page</a> states that: "If you'd like, you can change your Google Account email address that ends in gmail.com to a new email address that ends in gmail.com."</p><p>The feature appears to be in early rollout, and oddly enough, the support page currently only shows up in Hindi, which suggests Google may have jumped the gun on publishing the information before the feature is officially live.</p><p>Once the update rolls out fully, Gmail users will reportedly be able to switch to a new @gmail.com username while keeping everything intact. That includes access to all account data, emails, messages, photos, and connected Google services.</p><p>Better yet, Google will let users continue using both the old and new Gmail addresses for signing in, sending emails, and receiving messages.

Users will reportedly be able to choose a new Gmail username only once every 12 months. You will also only be allowed to change it three times after the original address, meaning a total of four possible Gmail usernames can be linked to a single Google Account.</p><p>Once available, the process to change your Gmail username will be fairly straightforward. You will need to head to the Personal info section of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://myaccount.google.com/google-account-email">My Google Account</a>, where you will find the option labeled Change Google Account Email Address. From there, you should be able to enter the new @gmail.com username you want to use.</p><p>The feature has not begun rolling out publicly yet, but the support page being updated this early almost always means a launch is imminent.

The company's foldable smartphone that turns into a 10-inch tablet is turning heads. However, like all foldable phones, durability has always been a major concern.</p><p>With a device that folds not once but twice, the concern only grows louder. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@JerryRigEverything">YouTuber JerryRigEverything</a> has now put the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-release-date">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> through his infamous durability test, and unfortunately for Samsung, the results were far from good.</p><p>In the video, Zack begins by demonstrating the phone's built-in sensors that detect incorrect folding. Just like we experienced in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-hands-on">hands-on time with the device</a>, the Galaxy Z TriFold vibrates and displays a warning message if you attempt to fold it the wrong way.</p><p>The test then kicks off with the scratch test. The outer display scratches at level 6 on the Mohs scale, the same result as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, with deeper grooves appearing at level 7. The inner flexible panel, however, is a completely different story. Because it uses a plastic-based folding screen, it scratches at level 2 and Zack notes the inner foldable screen can be easily and permanently damaged by fingernails, keys, or coins.</p><h2 id="galaxy-z-trifold-struggles-when-pushed-to-its-limits-2">Galaxy Z TriFold struggles when pushed to its limits</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0p_LmbcqEV4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Unfolded, the Galaxy Z TriFold is just 3.9mm thick at its thinnest point. But that incredibly thin frame leaves almost no room for structural reinforcement, and this becomes very clear during the bend test.</p><p>When pressure is applied in the opposite direction, the Galaxy Z TriFold snaps almost immediately. The frame buckles, the hinges shift out of alignment, and the device is permanently destroyed on camera. This officially makes it the first Samsung foldable to fail JerryRigEverything's structural bend test.</p><p>Zack then proceeds with a teardown of the device. Inside the phone are three individual batteries spread across its three folding segments, combining to a total capacity of 5,600 mAh. The teardown also reveals no thermal paste or specialized cooling hardware, suggesting Samsung is relying entirely on the thin aluminum frame for heat dissipation.</p><p>While the results are disappointing, they're not entirely unexpected for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts">trifolding phone</a>. With so many components packed into an incredibly slim chassis, there's little room left to reinforce structural rigidity.</p><p>That said, Samsung does claim that the hinge mechanism is tested to withstand up to 200,000 folds, which roughly totals to about five years if unfolded 100 times daily, so as long as you're careful with how you use and fold the device, you should be perfectly fine.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The XR market is a strange beast. I distinctly remember walking into the HTC Vive booth at MWC 2015 in Berlin and walking out as I'd just seen magic for the first time. We've seen the market make some pretty seismic shifts since then, and while 2020 was the last fundamental shift with the release of the Oculus Quest 2, 2026 may just be the most pivotal year yet for the industry.</p><p>That's because 2026 will be the year we see the first true XR glasses make their debut. Sure, we've seen plenty of cool face computers from Meta, RayNeo, and even Snapchat make impressive strides in smart glasses design, but I think it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-unveils-the-future-of-xr-new-features-for-galaxy-xr-and-upcoming-smartglasses-teased">the partnership between Xreal and Google</a> that's going to really showcase the next evolution in XR we've been craving.</p><p>In short, I think Xreal's Project Aura will be the holy grail people have been asking for, bridging the gap between immersive (but bulky) VR headsets and lightweight (but limiting) smart glasses. Android Central editor Michael Hicks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tried-google-samsung-ai-glasses-prototypes-before-android-show-xr-edition-heres-what-i-learned">got to try them in early December</a>, and his impressions offered me the hope I've been longing to see.</p><h2 id="aura-farming-2">Aura farming</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2233px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mpzwD6hGFTyofSbqWTpXdi" name="project-aura-tease" alt="Project Aura glasses teased" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mpzwD6hGFTyofSbqWTpXdi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2233" height="1256" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal Project Aura is going to totally revolutionize XR headsets as we know them when it launches in 2026. We don't have a price or a specific release date yet, but I'm pretty confident they'll launch at a lower price than Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr" target="_blank">Galaxy XR</a>, and I fully expect to see them on shelves before summertime.</p><p>Project Aura is special because it's truly the perfect combination of XR tech into one device. If you've used a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> glasses before, you'll understand how well they work and how comfortable they are to wear for long periods. Now, imagine those glasses with a substantially wider field of view and Android XR built in, and you'll understand why this is such a big deal.</p><p>There's been a lot of upselling of smart glasses by many outlets over the years, claiming that the latest pair "replaces the Apple Vision Pro" or some such similar nonsense. That's simply not been the case until now because smart glasses, no matter how good they have been, do not normally come with a proper operating system. Even ones that do are usually rudimentary and clunky.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn" name="samsung-galaxy-xr-floating-windows-chrome-official" alt="Three floating windows in an Android XR mixed reality environment with Chrome in the middle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hY49GwQinBftKNAfqgetnn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But Aura is powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, the same operating system that powers the $1800 Galaxy XR. No compromises, no silly limitations. This is the smart glasses dream that's been promised for so long, and it's coming in a form factor that won't feel weird or embarrassing to wear in public.</p><p>And I can already see the massive shift Aura is causing in the industry. Meta has already hired two of Apple's lead designers and restructured its Reality Labs division to focus on making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reality-labs-budget-2026-quest-4">Quest 4 as light and agile as possible</a>. Meta isn't even trying to compete with Android XR's vision right now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reportedly-scraps-horizon-os-partners-to-focus-on-the-quest">because it wants to focus</a> on making the best first-party hardware possible, and to me, that means making a Quest 4 that's more like a pair of smart glasses than what we currently think of as a VR headset.</p><p>We won't be seeing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a> in 2026, but the competition Meta will face from Google and its Android XR partners will ripple through the industry, as we saw when the Quest 2 launched in late 2020.</p><h2 id="letting-off-some-steam-2">Letting off some Steam</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YYhHjrsCYPFecRPcehw5R4" name="steam-frame-pcgamer-gameplay" alt="PC Gamer's own Tim Clark takes the Steam Frame for a spin in standalone mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YYhHjrsCYPFecRPcehw5R4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PCGamer)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So where does that leave current VR headsets? Trucking right along, really. VR headsets will remain the best way to play VR games until the Quest 4 rolls around and potentially changes that paradigm, but until then, two options will be the best choice for VR gamers.</p><p>The Quest 3 and 3S have solidified themselves as the best way to play VR games today, and the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/steam-frame-steam-deck-meta-quest-3">Steam Frame</a> headset from Valve is about to evolve the industry in yet another direction. Steam Frame, like the Meta Quest, is a fully functioning VR console that's meant to be played anywhere. It's a Steam Deck for your face, and it'll likely mark the first time we can officially play Half-Life: Alyx without a PC.</p><p>That's all made possible by Valve's brilliant engineering, which translates software and hardware architectures to make it possible to play Windows VR games on a Snapdragon-powered headset. It's the evolution of the technology that enabled the Steam Deck's Linux-based OS to play Windows games, and I fully expect it to blow people's minds when it lands in early 2026.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ib4A3btSQEZQCwhzVdyVWc" name="steam-frame-pcgamer-removable-compute-unit" alt="The removable compute unit of the Steam Frame" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ib4A3btSQEZQCwhzVdyVWc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PCGamer)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That, of course, leaves Meta in another very weird position. While the Quest is the de facto standalone VR headset and will remain with the largest library of bespoke and exclusive VR games for years to come, Valve's new entry will be the first viable alternative since the original Oculus Quest launched in 2019.</p><p>Sure, HTC and Pico have offered some level of competition, but those companies faced significant hurdles in delivering a Quest-grade VR console that Valve won't. The biggest stumbling block for future Steam Frame owners is that Valve isn't making any new VR games. They're fully focused on making it easy for developers to make games for the Frame, and that seems to be taking up all of the company's attention for the time being.</p><p>It's going to be an extremely exciting year, with two massive shifts happening at once, and it's going to set the stage for years to come!</p> ]]></dc:content>

That builds upon the excellence that Xreal One delivered with its dedicated X1 chip that provides spatial tracking for any device it's plugged into, a first for any pair of XR glasses and a key differentiator between Xreal's products and any other on the market.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QEU5Xs8NSYTNdwSfZsnMsB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-gesture-controls" alt="A photo of the author doing a two-handed pinch-to-zoom gesture while wearing the Samsung Galaxy XR headset." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QEU5Xs8NSYTNdwSfZsnMsB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Samsung Galaxy XR</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Galaxy XR </a>is Samsung's first VR headset in years, and it's the first product to launch with Android XR, a brand new version of Android built for the next era of spatial computing devices. While the price will certainly keep some people away, there's no denying how good these displays look and how polished the Android XR experience looks, especially compared to Meta's software. It's got a few bugs that need squashing (and will be as the platform matures), but the fact that you can install any Android app or game on it without any nonsense or modding is a massive win for Samsung and Google.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-new-single-player-vr-game-marvel-s-deadpool-vr"><span>Best new single-player VR game: Marvel's Deadpool VR</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Dw9ZwhaRiWST43qGDuUxRG" name="Marvels-Deadpool-VR-key-art" alt="Deadpool's upper torso with the crown of his head open and little cartoon figures of Deadpool and foes fighting around his shoulders, with the logo "Marvel's Deadpool VR" next to him." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dw9ZwhaRiWST43qGDuUxRG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Twisted Pixel / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Every year, Meta's official Oculus Studios developers drop a major release, and this year's blockbuster release is none other than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/marvels-deadpool-vr-hands-on">Marvel's Deadpool VR</a>. The game comes from Twisted Pixel Games and debuts an original Deadpool story with a star-studded cast that includes Neil Patrick Harris, John Leguizamo, Brina Palencia, and more.</p><p>But don't just rely on the big names to sell you on it, because the game puts you in every situation Deadpool might find himself in, with arms flying, swords clashing, bullets spraying, and more. We can't decide if the levels themselves or the bosses are a bigger spectacle, but either way, you'll have an amazing time embodying Deadpool like never before. Plus, you'll never forget the first time you look down and find your arms missing. It's a real mind job! Grab it for 20% off until Jan 4.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OnfkhaSyeKU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow</p><p>Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow is the first Thief game in over a decade and serves as a proper sequel to the original PC stealth classics. The jump to VR-only means this still looks and feels like a Thief game, but the immersive nature of physically moving around transforms the gameplay in a meaningful way.</p><p>You play as a new protagonist, but the special part is that the mechanical eye you find at the beginning of the game allows Garrett, his original voice actor, to guide you through the story. You'll sneak around in proper Thief fashion, climbing walls, scaling buildings, hiding in the shadows, taking out guards, and even sabotaging environments, all while stealing as much loot as you can find in each level. It's a stealth gamer's dream and a real treat for Meta Quest gamers!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-new-multi-player-vr-game-demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked"><span>Best new multi-player VR game: Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="8sn4MbQT5hXLXD46TstD5n" name="demeo-x-d-and-d-mixed-reality-gameplay" alt="Fighting battles in mixed reality in Demeo X Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked for the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8sn4MbQT5hXLXD46TstD5n.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="426" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When the original Demeo launched on the Oculus Quest in May 2021, I immediately wanted a D&D-licensed and expanded version of the game. That's exactly what Demeo x D&D: Battlemarked is. The game uses the familiar turn-based strategy RPG roots of both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/demeo-hands-on">Demeo and Dungeons & Dragons</a>, combining two powerful IPs into one impressively complete package that's easy as pie to play with friends.</p><p>To make that even better, it now only supports cross-platform play between Meta Quest, Steam, and PlayStation, but VR players can seamlessly play with non-VR players without hassle. Now that's a D&D night done right, and it makes this tabletop strategy game our multiplayer game of the year!</p><p><strong>Runner-up: </strong>Forefront</p><p>Forefront can quickly be summed up as "Battlefield VR." With support for 32 players, it's one of the most complete VR multiplayer experiences available, and we're not surprised since it comes from the developers of Breachers, a previous VR multiplayer GOTY. As you might expect from a Battlefield-like game, you won't just be running around shooting other players with guns.</p><p>You'll be piloting jet skis, boats, jeeps, ATVs, helicopters, tanks, and more. And since it's in VR, communication with your team isn't just limited to voice. You can use full body language to plan attacks and feel more like you're on the battlefield than ever before.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I could also see Google creating a Gemini equivalent to Apple's Workout Buddy, synced to your Fitbit training plan; it would give you real-time, personalized feedback and advice during an activity.</p><h2 id="next-generation-hardware-2">Next-generation hardware</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="753wRPDvAPADLF554pLHz6" name="snapdragon-wear-01.jpg" alt="A Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear chip inside of a smartwatch with a bokeh background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/753wRPDvAPADLF554pLHz6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of my big hopes for 2025 was a powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a> SoC with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-is-risc-v">RISC-V architecture</a>, based on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">interview with a Qualcomm VP</a> where he mentioned their goal of making "AI-driven" hardware with a "week's worth of battery life" and the ability to support years of updates.</p><p>Instead, the Gen-2 chip we got was a more incremental upgrade, focused on improved efficiency and satellite connectivity. It's perfectly functional, but not especially fast, even for everyday app and menu loading. Samsung's 3nm Exynos W1000 is more advanced for everyday performance, but I wouldn't count on it for next-gen AI capabilities, either.</p><p>The sooner we get a true next-generation smartwatch chip with the neural processing for powerful on-watch AI, the happier I'll be. Maybe Google could even make a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/upcoming-pixel-watches-could-play-it-safe-and-i-dont-like-it">Tensor chip</a> with stronger neural performance, as one leak suggested.

It didn't share other details, except for its internal name "Galaxy Watch 9 Ultra." Whatever it's called, Samsung needs to make the Ultra 2 <em>much</em> more exciting to justify the $650 price tag, now that cheaper Galaxy Watches have stolen its look.</p><p>For one, I'd demand a battery boost: The 590mAh capacity hasn't changed since the Watch 5 Pro, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> lasts nearly twice as long. For another, LTE alone isn't that exciting when the Apple Watch Ultra 3 has 5G and satellite connectivity. If its MicroLED tech isn't ready for a smartwatch, Samsung still needs to give the Ultra 2 display <em>something</em> to stand out, like a higher PPI ratio.</p><p>Ultra watches are meant for the outdoors, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> never really delivered the training software necessary to attract athletes; anyone willing to spend $650 would spend even more on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>. Samsung started off with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-running-coach-galaxy-watch-8-is-cool-idea-held-back-by-hardware-and-execution">Running Coach</a> this year, but it needs to do more to keep pace with Apple and Google/ Fitbit, instead of relying on third-party fitness tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-announces-ifit-partnership-with-galaxy-watch-integration-and-six-month-demo">iFit</a>.</p><h2 id="upgrade-the-pixel-watch-5-to-match-the-new-fitbit-coach-2">Upgrade the Pixel Watch 5 to match the new Fitbit Coach</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ReQt7HNf2JKsWow7hoJ4fN" name="Fitbit-Premium-Health-Coach-Today-tab" alt="A photo of the Google Pixel Watch 4 sitting next to a Pixel 9a open to the Fitbit app, showing the Fitbit Premium Health Coach preview with the Today tab open; it shows new widgets and insights." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ReQt7HNf2JKsWow7hoJ4fN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We already know the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/fitbit-personal-health-coach-preview-hands-on">Fitbit Personal Health Coach</a> will launch in 2026 with AI-generated coaching and health insights. But the Wear OS Fitbit app is still quite basic, unable to import most workouts (besides running) from Gemini's training plans. You have to log things like gym reps manually.</p><p>If lightweight <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> can sync workout plans from the Connect app and automatically track exercise reps, I'd assume Google can do the same with more powerful Snapdragon hardware! It's just a matter of implementing Fitbit Coach's plans and insights directly in Wear OS 7.</p><p>I've also waited for years for Google to offer a Google Maps course creation tool, where you build a route, export it as a GPX file to your Pixel Watch, and then follow it during a run, hike, or bike activity. The Galaxy Watch Ultra can import GPX files from other apps; Google could one-up Samsung by actually letting you create them.</p><h2 id="a-oneplus-watch-4-with-its-own-software-surprises-2">A OnePlus Watch 4 with its own software surprises</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TCgSwHtMYzc5evRGzgoX7" name="oneplus-watch-3-fitness-rings" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with fitness rings on the screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TCgSwHtMYzc5evRGzgoX7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For OnePlus, 2025 was all about hardware upgrades. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">Compared to the Watch 2</a>, the Watch 3 added a titanium bezel, a working crown, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">denser silicone-carbon battery</a>, a larger and brighter display, an upgraded coprocessor with better background task performance, and two new health sensors. It essentially caught up with other premium smartwatches.</p><p>Ignoring my Wear OS pessimism and assuming a OnePlus Watch 4 is coming in a couple of months, I don't need more hardware upgrades, really. I just want to see if OnePlus's spin on Wear OS 6 has a standout feature, compared to Google's Material 3 Expressive and watch face theming, or Samsung's phone-like multi-info Tiles.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company’s Pixel Watch 4 outshone what it means to be a great smartwatch.</p><p>For a second year in a row, the Oura Ring 4 takes the win for best smart ring, and how can you deny that?? It truly is the best smart ring out there, and with added features, your quality of life can be improved so much more.</p><p>Read on ahead to learn what our colleagues have to say about the best Android smartwatch of the year, but of course also about smart glasses, and the best smart ring!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smartwatch-google-pixel-watch-4"><span>Best smartwatch: Google Pixel Watch 4</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1651px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="K7DK3Weevo23e9nAfkQdWa" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Moonstone-stretch-band-official-lifestyle-1" alt="The Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K7DK3Weevo23e9nAfkQdWa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1651" height="929" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch 4 dominated the staff vote, with only a few Galaxy Watch 8 or Garmin picks. People are impressed with how many upgrades Google packed into this thing: the classy domed display, the significant battery boost paired with top-tier charging speeds, the accurate and efficient dual-band GPS, the satellite SOS, and the Material 3 Expressive UI redesign that feels much more Pixel-like.</p><p>Having reviewed and loved the Pixel Watch 4 myself, I could go on! But the main point is that, four generations in, Google is still focused on innovation and upgrades, while more established brands like Apple and Samsung have fallen into comfortable rhythms and rarely make such <em>dramatic</em> changes year over year. Plus, the Pixel Watch 4 experience should keep improving as Google upgrades the Gemini assistant experience and Fitbit AI coaching.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-smart-ring-oura-ring-4"><span>Best smart ring: Oura Ring 4</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="kVqcyBEzxFJTCpBhDGLPDX" name="Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-07" alt="Oura Ring 4 Ceramic in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kVqcyBEzxFJTCpBhDGLPDX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4021" height="2261" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oura continues to dominate the smart ring category, and while the Oura Ring 4 launched in the latter half of 2024, the company has not slowed down, launching massive updates to the hardware and software. The new Oura Ring Ceramic is a beautiful piece of hardware for those of you who want a more classy-looking wearable, and the newly revamped Oura app adds touches of Apple’s Liquid Glass UI design while invoking a calmer overall design to really hone in on the wellness aspect of the product.</p><p>Oura also leaned into AI this year with the launch of the Advisor, an AI-powered chatbot that helps you understand your metrics and can chat with you about your stats.

Fresh styles are paired with excellent camera upgrades that both boost resolution to 3K and deliver substantially better video stabilization. Not only that, but the glasses feature double the battery life of the original release, plus new features like conversation focus, better microphones, and even better speakers with Dolby Atmos Surround support for an amazing audio experience. Oh, and don't forget the fact that Meta updates these basically every month with a new feature, and you get a pair of AI glasses that can't be beat.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you have been thinking about upgrading your Google storage or trying out the company's AI features, this could be a good time to do it.</p><p>Google shared details of the offer in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/2003573036818342260">post on X</a>, highlighting the discount on its top-tier Google AI Pro plan. While the post focuses on the premium tier, the company is also offering the same 50% discount on its more basic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> plans, including the entry-level 100GB option.</p><p>Under this promotion, the basic 100GB Google One plan is discounted to $10 for the entire year, down from its usual $20 price. The 2TB storage-only plan is also available at half price, dropping to $50 annually instead of the regular $100.</p><p>These plans are ideal if you primarily want extra cloud storage for services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-drive-update-makes-navigating-pdfs-and-files-effortless">Google Drive</a>, Gmail, and Google Photos, but they do not include access to Google's full suite of AI features.</p><h2 id="google-one-is-cheaper-right-now-but-only-for-some-2">Google One is cheaper right now, but only for some</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Cmp5dXiSM6rmM8MFqjHNGX" name="Google-One-AI-plans" alt="A Pixel 9a sitting next to an Android figurine showing the Google One AI Pro and AI Ultra plans." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cmp5dXiSM6rmM8MFqjHNGX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you are looking for storage plus AI tools, Google is also discounting its Google AI Pro plan by 50%. The annual price of this tier is now $100, down from $200. Along with 2TB of shared storage across Google services, the AI Pro plan unlocks a more complete set of AI features.</p><p>Subscribers to Google AI Pro get higher usage limits for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 3 Pro</a>, access to the latest Veo models, and additional AI tools such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-antigravitys-rate-limits-are-changing-amid-incredible-demand">Antigravity</a> and Gemini CLI. The plan also includes access to Google's new Google Home Premium Standard plan at no extra cost.</p><p>Until now, free access to Google One benefits was mostly limited to Pixel phone owners and students. If you don't fall into either category and have been curious about Google One or Google's AI offerings, this promotion makes it significantly easier to try them out without paying full price.</p><p>It is worth noting that this deal is only available to new users. However, there is a workaround if you really want to take advantage of the discount.</p><p>You can sign up using a new Google account and then add your existing email addresses to the Google One family plan. Since family sharing is supported on these plans, you can still access the storage and AI features at half the usual cost.</p><p>You can claim the new Google One promotions <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://one.google.com/ai-nye">using this link</a>. It is worth noting that these offers are typically time-sensitive and will likely be available only until around New Year's Eve.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This update focuses primarily on stability rather than adding new functionality.</p><p>As per the official changelog, Android 16 QPR3 Beta 1.1 fixes an issue that caused some apps to crash immediately on startup (Issue <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/470144317">#470144317</a>, Issue <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/470214834">#470214834</a>). Google lists this as a change addressing problems where certain apps would fail to launch correctly.</p><p>The new build bumps the version number to CP11.251114.007, up from CP11.251114.006, and comes in at roughly 58 MB in size. It is available for a wide range of Pixel devices, starting from the Pixel 6 series and extending all the way up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">latest Pixel 10 lineup</a>.

Google also added the ability to swap the back and recent buttons when using three-button navigation.</p><p>Another standout change introduced with QPR3 Beta 1 was improved flashlight controls. Instead of a simple on-or-off toggle, the system now lets you adjust the brightness level of the flashlight, similar to iPhones.</p><p>If you want to try out the latest Android 16 beta, make sure your Pixel is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">enrolled in the Android Beta Program</a>.

Recently, Pixel users on the Android 16 QPR3 beta reported a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-cameras-are-shivering-after-the-latest-android-16-qpr3-beta">jittery camera issue</a>, while many Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 users have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/that-infuriating-pixel-10-pixel-9-speakerphone-issue-wont-see-a-fix-anytime-soon-if-ever">complained about speakerphone problems</a>.</p><p>Now, another issue affecting some Google Pixel owners has surfaced, and this time it is stopping certain photos from being saved on the device.</p><p>Many users on Reddit have started reporting that pictures they took using their phones went "missing" and are not appearing in the Photos app (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-missing-photos-3627620/">Android Authority</a>). A user named <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1on6z0t/missing_photos_in_pixel/">Blazgamer initially reported</a> that their photos disappeared after receiving a notification saying that a few photos were being processed in the background.</p><p>Similarly, another user, portmafia9719, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1pts8yn/is_there_even_a_way_to_recover_my_photos_they_are/">reported</a> a related issue where their device got stuck in a backup and processing loop, after which some photos were gone and could not be found. The user reported that these missing files didn't show up in the gallery, trash, or anywhere else on the device, and instead seem to have gotten "lost" during processing.</p><h2 id="this-pixel-bug-can-cause-photos-to-vanish-entirely-2">This Pixel bug can cause photos to vanish entirely</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qsgmVmw78rNhCi8dvuastD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-camera-viewfinder-01" alt="Using a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL to take a photo of a stone fish fountain" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qsgmVmw78rNhCi8dvuastD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some users theorize that the issue occurs when you take a large number of photos in a very short period of time. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1pts8yn/comment/nvjzxyv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">One explanation</a> suggests that when the camera app gets stuck and does not complete post-processing, it eventually clears everything from memory and fails to write the files to storage.</p><p>However, there is currently no way to verify this.

I personally have not faced this issue on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 10 Pro</a> so far, but several users claim they have lost photos due to this bug.</p><p>We have reached out to Google for a comment on the issue. If more users continue to report this problem, the company may take action and release a fix. But for now, there is no fix for this issue out there.

With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-remix-images-google-messages">the new Remix feature in Google Messages</a>, users can find Nano Banana image editing and generation features right in their conversations. Although the feature is opt-in, Remix in Google Messages is publicly displayed throughout the app, complete with a banana emoji signifying Nano Banana.</p><p>After the Remix in Google Messages feature launched in November, it was not received well by Android fans, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1ouiguh/remix_makes_sending_photos_to_friends_even_more/" target="_blank">many criticizing Remix on Reddit</a>. By December 2025, Google responded to the criticism in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/thread/392321302/update-on-messages-remix-feature-we-re-working-on-it" target="_blank">support post</a>.</p><p>"Thank you for sharing your feedback about the Remix feature in Messages. We hear you," wrote a Google community manager in the post. <br>Our team is actively working on improvements and refining the feature to make it smoother, more user-friendly, and enjoyable for everyone. Stay tuned for updates!"</p><p>Now, Google is toning down the look of Remix in version 20251212_00_RC01 of the Google Messages app beta, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/20/google-messages-nano-banana-remix/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. After opening an image in full-screen view, the pill-shaped Remix button with a banana emoji is now completely removed. Instead, there's a general circle button for Remix that lives next to the reaction and comment buttons in Messages. This circular button has a sparkle emoji, instead of a banana emoji, to denote the AI-powered features.</p><a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/20/google-messages-nano-banana-remix/" target="_blank"><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1518px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.68%;"><img id="kwqe2MVPpdUna6pkmHVSuj" name="Google-Messages-Remix-Update-9to5Google" alt="The Remix button in the Google Messages app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kwqe2MVPpdUna6pkmHVSuj.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1518" height="906" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The old button for Remix in Google Messages (left) beside the new button (right), as reported by 9to5Google.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></a><p>Holding down an image in a Google Messages conversation still reveals a pill-shaped Remix icon, but it's smaller. Additionally, the banana emoji is replaced with an image icon featuring an AI sparkle. The Remix in Messages feature still works as expected, but the visual cues are less busy with the redesigned buttons.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Google Messages users will appreciate the redesigned Remix interface. Critics of the feature complained that there is no way to disable Remix in Messages completely, and this visual change doesn't address that part of the issue. For now, Google Messages users will be saying goodbye to the Nano Banana emoji.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Billboard is a staple of the music industry, and the publication has been tracking the top-selling albums each week since 1940. Of course, the way we consume music has undergone multiple significant changes since then. Most recently, music streaming has completely taken over the industry, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.riaa.com/growth-in-paid-subscription-streaming-drives-mid-year-2025-us-recorded-music-revenues-to-new-high-reports-riaa/" target="_blank">Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)</a> reporting streaming accounts for 84% of recorded music revenue in the U.S.</p><p>Since 2005, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube">YouTube</a> has been one of the biggest music streamers, especially for  music videos. The platform began contributing to Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart in 2013, and started influencing the Billboard Hot 200 albums chart in 2019. In other words, YouTube has impacted at least one Billboard chart for more than a decade, but that's all changing next month.</p><p>Starting on Jan. 16, 2026, YouTube will stop reporting streaming data to Billboard. YouTube streams will no longer influence Billboard's top singles or albums charts, which instantly changes how the most popular songs on YouTube perform on the leaderboards. Whether you're a casual YouTube streamer or a die-hard music love, this change is going to affect you one way or another.</p><h2 id="why-youtube-won-t-report-to-billboard-next-year-2">Why YouTube won't report to Billboard next year</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8" name="youtube-android-central" alt="Android Central's YouTube homepage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VgX6kso9EqHUMJuNkZZXm8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In 2025, tracking the performance of albums and songs is a complicated effort. Music streams, album purchases, and everything in between need to be accounted for. Charts like Billboard use "album units" to gauge a song or album's relative success. One complete album sale equals an album unit, but multiple individual song purchases, paid song streams, or free and ad-supported song streams can add up to equal an album unit.</p><p>YouTube takes exception with that last part of Billboard's album unit calculation — free or ad-supported streams and paid streams aren't counted equally. If you stream a song on Spotify with a subscription, it'll be worth more than a free YouTube stream. Specifically, here's how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/billboard-charts-add-more-weight-on-demand-streaming-2026/" target="_blank">Billboard</a> currently calculates an album unit for its charts:</p><div><blockquote><p>Currently, each album consumption unit equals one album sale, 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album.</p><p>Billboard</p></blockquote></div><p>YouTube has had "extensive discussions" with Billboard about its calculations, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-billboard-chart-update/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. Billboard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/billboard-charts-add-more-weight-on-demand-streaming-2026/" target="_blank">announced</a> plans to add more weight to both paid and free streams earlier this month, which will take effect starting with Billboard charts dated Jan. 17, 2026. Thereafter, an album unit will equal 2,500 ad-supported streams or 1,000 paid or subscription on-demand streams.</p><p>"The change means that it will take 33.3% fewer ad-supported on-demand streams of songs from an album, and 20% fewer paid/subscription on-demand streams of songs from an album, to equal an album unit," according to Billboard.</p><p>So, while Billboard is narrowing the gap between paid and ad-supported streams starting next month, it hasn't met YouTube's demand. The Google-owned streaming platform wants full value parity between ad-supported and paid streams. Billboard isn't budging, at least for now, and thus YouTube is pulling its data from Billboard charts one day before the new streaming values take effect.</p><div><blockquote><p>Billboard uses an outdated formula that weights subscription-supported streams higher than ad-supported... We’re simply asking that every stream is counted fairly and equally, whether it is subscription-based or ad-supported—because every fan matters and every play should count.</p><p>YouTube</p></blockquote></div><p>In YouTube's blog post, authored by global head of music Lyor Cohen, the company also pointed out that YouTube's music streaming data includes a mix of paid and ad-supported streams. Some stream with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">the ad-free YouTube Premium subscription plan</a>, while other stream with the ad-supported free version of YouTube.</p><p>A spokesperson for Billboard said in a statement that "there are so many ways a fan can support an artist they love, and each has a specific place in the music ecosystem."</p><p>"Billboard strives to measure that activity appropriately; balanced by various factors including consumer access, revenue analysis, data validation and industry guidance," the spokesperson for Billboard continued. "It is our hope that YouTube reconsiders and joins Billboard in recognizing the reach and popularity of artists on all music platforms and in celebrating their achievements through the power of fans and how they interact with the music that they love."</p><p>Right now, it appears that both YouTube and Billboard recognize their mutualistic relationship in the music streaming industry, and left the door open for YouTube data returning to the charts. However, neither Billboard nor YouTube sounds ready to concede on the hard stances they've taken on album unit consumption weighting.</p><h2 id="what-it-means-for-youtube-users-and-the-music-industry-2">What it means for YouTube users and the music industry</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-youtube-app.jpg" alt="The YouTube app listing on the Google Play Store, running on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For users, there will be an impact to the way you consume music on YouTube, with the severity depending on how much you care about supporting your favorite artists. If you want your top songs or albums to help an artist climb the Billboard Hot 100 or Hot 200 charts, you probably shouldn't stream on YouTube after Jan. 16, 2025.</p><p>Additionally, if you follow Billboard charts, expect overall streaming numbers to diminish immediately following the change, as music videos get billions of streams on YouTube. With those streams soon to be no longer factored into Billboard charts, the number of album units calculated overall will almost certainly be lower than usual. Songs, albums, and artists that earn more streams on YouTube than other platforms may see a considerable charting hit compared to others.</p><p>There's also a wider industry concern that music releases on YouTube could be deprioritized by artists and publishers if they are not making an impact on the Billboard charts, which are crucial for gauging an album or song's success. This sentiment is shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/youtube-to-pull-music-data-from-billboards-charts-because-it-doesnt-like-its-ranking-formula/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>, and if this turns out to be the case, it could directly affect people who stream music via YouTube.</p><p>My take on YouTube's decision to pull out of Billboard charts is that with this move, everyone loses. Billboard's data becomes less accurate as it misses out data from a key platform that represents billions of streams. YouTube gives die-hard music fans less of a reason to stream on its platform, and potentially strains its relationship with artists and publishers. And users could see fewer songs uploaded to YouTube if publishers don't find the platform as attractive.</p><p>YouTube's hard stance on counting ad-supported and paid streams equally is the wrong one. It leaves no room for compromise and would require Billboard to rework its entire notion of an album unit's worth. Instead, the two companies should work together to find a middle ground, because everyone wins when YouTube contributes to Billboard charts.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The strings were spotted within the Media Router framework and include multiple references to Cast, suggesting Google is actively developing casting support for in-car Android experiences.</p><p>That said, the report notes that the strings are fairly generic, so it's possible Google is not directly adding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/android-tv/apple-tv-android-app-adds-google-cast-support">Cast support to Android</a> Auto just yet.

Chances are, you won't find much variety. Even if you ask people what brand they prefer, the answer is almost certainly only "Apple" or "Samsung."</p><p>Unlike the rest of the world, the U.S. smartphone market has experienced substantial stagnation, effectively giving power to two main brands. While smartphone market share reports will tell you that brands like Motorola and Google now sport notably increased shares of the pie, it's the mindshare that hasn't changed much.</p><p>But things could finally start looking up in 2026 if the potential deal between TikTok and American investors pans out in the New Year, and it could set a precedent that enables more companies to properly compete in North America as a whole.</p><h2 id="the-clock-counts-down-2">The clock counts down</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iYp25mxcTDbEQWRud7ondm" name="tiktok-download-no-iphone-tiktok-logo" alt="Demonstrating the many ways to download TikTok on an Android phone while an iPhone sits face down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iYp25mxcTDbEQWRud7ondm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you haven't heard the news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/report-bytedance-creating-new-tiktok-us-version-government-concerns">TikTok's U.S. division</a> might finally see the 80% divestiture required by U.S. law to continue operating in the country. As we saw with the Huawei debacle, any action like this taken by the U.S. government will almost certainly see Canada follow suit, affecting nearly the entire North American market.</p><p>While TikTok is obviously an app and not a smartphone manufacturer, the actions taken by TikTok and its investors could set a precedent for Chinese smartphone manufacturers to follow. OnePlus already has its own US corporation for sales and support, and it would be a dream come true to see this kind of practice roll out more widely.</p><p>Mainly, I want to see brands like OnePlus, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Honor make inroads in the U.S. through tactics like this. Obviously, OnePlus phones are already officially sold in North America, though devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 15</a> are only sold unlocked through Amazon, Best Buy, and OnePlus' own website.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi" name="Best of 2025" alt="OnePlus phone launches 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Creating new U.S.-based companies could finally give North American customers the variety we've needed for so long. We saw something similar happen with Honor back in 2020 when Huawei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-sheds-honor-brand-attempt-save-it">sold the company off</a>, allowing the brand to continue to make phones and still use Google services.</p><p>Since then, Honor has become one of the best smartphone brands and even offers seven years of updates on its latest flagships, the same amount as Google and Samsung offer on their best phones.</p><p>But realistically, this type of transition won't happen overnight, and while I'd love to see major progress throughout 2026, I think it'll take a bit longer for things to get better.</p><h2 id="stick-to-the-status-quo-2">Stick to the status quo</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BKzZgQjzDX32QuyKAN7tGQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BKzZgQjzDX32QuyKAN7tGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Until then, I fully expect the status quo to continue in North America, minus a few exciting exceptions. Motorola could very well be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorolas-ces-teaser-package-hints-at-a-moto-fold">making a book-style foldable</a> to compete with the Galaxy Z Fold series, offering North American customers one more alternative.</p><p>To date, only the Pixel Fold has attempted to challenge Samsung's dominance, and Google hasn't exactly delivered a truly excellent product yet. Surprisingly, even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold">Galaxy TriFold</a> is coming to the U.S. in 2026, marking a significant milestone in foldable phones.</p><p>There's also a glimmer of hope for flicker-sensitive users now that Apple and Google both started work on alternatives to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>. To date, only Motorola and OnePlus offer proper alternatives to headache-inducing OLEDs in the North American smartphone market, another side effect of the stagnation here.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9vhqHQ98fBwT5iEWZ8drMa" name="e-ink-phones-fairphone-6" alt="Three E Ink Phones and the Fairphone 6 on a tea tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9vhqHQ98fBwT5iEWZ8drMa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And there's also the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-sustainable-repairable-fairphone-6-is-now-available-in-the-us-for-usd899">Fairphone 6</a> and several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-e-ink-android-phone-is-the-kindle-phone-ive-always-wanted">really cool minimalist phones</a> that aim to challenge our dependence on Google and our addiction to smartphones, in general. I'm loving this trend of minimalist and E Ink phones that provide good alternatives to the ultrabright, flashy, and addictive, as they allow users to participate in modern society while avoiding the pitfalls.</p><p>I don't see these types of phones making it to carrier shelves in 2026, but mind share, awareness, and reasonable prices might just help get them into more hands next year as companies like Bigme and Boox continue to launch more products. I don't see 2026 as being a revolutionary year for the North American smartphone market, but the groundwork has been laid for big moves to take place in the next 12 months, at the least.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google very specifically focused on the "everyman" angle for the phone this year, and that comes through in the marketing and the user experience.</p><p>This is a dead-simple experience that's uber-friendly for ex-iPhone users to adjust to, and it comes with plenty of friendly hints and tutorials that help you learn what a superior mobile OS should feel like.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-value-phone-cmf-phone-2-pro"><span>Best value phone: CMF Phone 2 Pro</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="ZLHpAW3rgyTKPqv4x254uW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZLHpAW3rgyTKPqv4x254uW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6276" height="2690" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a sea of middling budget phones, Nothing’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF Phone 2 Pro</a> shines like a bright light. There isn’t anything as good if you just need a reliable phone that costs around $250, and the software is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best you’ll see in this category. Nothing essentially distilled the best parts of its high-end offerings into the CMF Phone 2 Pro, and the result is a budget phone you’ll actually want to use.</p><p>No, this is a budget phone that’s actually fun. The software obviously plays a big part in this; Nothing OS is uniquely different from every other Android interface, and the bold design and clean UI pair really well with the hardware.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uPmSt4JEmxH9vhB6DMzcZ7" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-review-6" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 face down with the pen on top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPmSt4JEmxH9vhB6DMzcZ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Runner-up: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-review">Moto G Stylus 2025</a></p><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 is a good alternative that brings a rugged design to this category. It isn’t as fast or doesn’t have cameras as good as the CMF Phone 2 Pro, but it lasts just as long, and the MIL-STD-810H rating means it can take a beating. It even gets a 3.5mm jack, and while you don’t get more than two software updates, Motorola is doing a better job with its UI in general, so there are no problems as such in this area.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-camera-phone-google-pixel-10-pro"><span>Best camera phone: Google Pixel 10 Pro</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UDqxRFAWemzGGPEATnbeGD" name="Pixel-10-Pro-all-hues" alt="Pixel 10 Pro in all shades" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UDqxRFAWemzGGPEATnbeGD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's Pixel phones are practically a shoo-in for "best camera" in any given year.

From a Gemini-powered assistant that teaches you the rules of photography in real time across any scenario, to a locally processed AI-enhanced zoom, the Pixel 10 Pro is a powerful tool in anyone's pocket.

But, if you live in one of the countries where it's sold, there's simply no better smartphone camera on earth. Oppo leverages its partnership with Hasselblad brilliantly on this phone, resulting in the best selfies, portrait shots, and even zoomed-in shots from its telephoto camera. Power users can also snap up an external telephoto lens that delivers DSLR-level zoom, completing the picture of it as the ultimate smartphone camera experience.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-foldable-phone-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7"><span>Best foldable phone: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4917px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L9Qphtkffet32e9BYXYMYT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-10" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L9Qphtkffet32e9BYXYMYT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4917" height="2766" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Is this really a surprise?

IDC forecasts nearly 30% year-over-year growth for foldables in 2026, with Apple capturing roughly 22% of unit share and over a third of market value thanks to a price point near $2,400.

If they succeed, smart glasses could become the next big wearable trend.</p><h2 id="wearables-get-helpful-not-noisy-2">Wearables get “helpful, not noisy” </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="owttN5qAUWQSMxnLyoQYWG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-8" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/owttN5qAUWQSMxnLyoQYWG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wearables are evolving from notification hubs to health companions. Screen-free devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura</a> and Whoop have captured consumer attention by focusing on deep biometrics such as sleep, recovery, and readiness. Expect more rings and bands that prioritize wellness insights over constant alerts, along with medical-adjacent features like ECG and blood pressure monitoring. Traditional smartwatches will lean harder into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a> and safety features to justify their premium positioning.</p><h2 id="pc-growth-slows-2">PC growth slows </h2><p>Following a strong refresh cycle in 2025, PC growth is expected to cool in 2026. DIY builders face an especially challenging year as DRAM shortages drive up component costs. Windows on ARM products could also see a mild boost as second-generation products hit shelves, leading to further discounts on the prior generation. Plus, Nvidia is rumoured to launch a chip in late 2026, which should help the entire category.</p><h2 id="who-wins-in-2026-2">Who wins in 2026? </h2><p>Apple is well-positioned to dominate headlines and margins. Its foldable iPhone will validate the category and put pressure on Android vendors, while its tight control over hardware and supply chains will help it weather DRAM-related shocks better than most PC makers. A mainstream-priced Mac is expected to launch early in 2026, which will also put a lot of pressure on the Windows PC makers.</p><p>However, Samsung isn't far behind. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> will reinforce its leadership in foldables, and its smartphone strength and scale will continue, allowing the company to steal share from smaller Android smartphone players. The strength in smartphones often translates into wearable success since Samsung is great at bundling products, and with the upcoming XR glasses, Samsung is poised to play a major role in the smart glasses market.</p><p>When it comes to chipsets that will back these smartphones, Qualcomm remains the silent powerhouse. Its chips power nearly every premium Android flagship and dominate XR hardware. The upcoming Snapdragon X2 Elite will bring major CPU and GPU gains to PCs, along with an 80-TOPS NPU for AI workloads. Expect thin, sleek designs and perhaps even gaming-focused laptops built around this platform.</p><p>That said, Android XR looks promising, but Google still needs to prove it can deliver polished software and seamless Gemini integration at scale. Similarly, rumors of Android PCs persist, but Google’s track record in this space is weak. Even with Qualcomm’s hardware muscle, it’s unclear why consumers would choose Android over Windows or Mac.</p><h2 id="not-everyone-wins-2">Not everyone wins</h2><p>Consumers will feel the pinch as prices rise across categories. Memory shortages will lead to fewer upgrades at the same price points, smaller discounts on older models, and aggressive de-specing across devices. If you know you’ll need a phone or PC in 2026, buying early could save you money.</p><p>Smaller vendors face an even harsher reality. In tight supply cycles, memory suppliers prioritize top brands, leaving smaller and local players with little leverage. Some may exit the market entirely as BOM costs make devices unviable.</p><h2 id="how-to-navigate-2026-2">How to navigate 2026 </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vkQHj79sJVhEomysckUmgc" name="Huawei Mate X7" alt="Huawei Mate X7 hands-on testing in Dubai on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vkQHj79sJVhEomysckUmgc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re eyeing a foldable, consider waiting until Apple’s launch later in the year, as pricing and trade-in dynamics will shift.

AI will become ambient across phones, glasses, wearables, and PCs, but supply shocks and rising costs will test both brands and buyers. Foldables and smart glasses will dominate headlines, PC growth will slow, and smaller vendors will fight for survival. For consumers, timing purchases strategically will matter more than ever.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Early 5-year forecasts were aggressive, with double-digit growth and fast bites into market share. However, the predictions tempered as shipments softened from the initial peaks, and the foldable market’s unit share never exceeded 1.6% of total smartphones.</p><p>As the year ends, foldables are expected to grow by just 10% YoY in 2025, as per IDC’s latest forecast, a growth lower than the record figures observed in the initial years of the technology. Still, the form factor refuses to stay down, and the tide is turning in favor of foldables.</p><p>Although the first foldable phones launched with book-style designs, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip models</a> quickly became the dominant form factor — driven by their lower price points and, perhaps, the nostalgia of flip feature phones. It wasn’t until 2025 that fold models captured the lead with 53% of market share in the category.</p><p>Android brands, led by Samsung, Honor, Oppo, and Google, leveraged their latest foldable models, determined to challenge the $1,000+ premium segment long dominated by Apple, which lacked a foldable offering.</p><h2 id="how-new-engineering-just-eliminated-the-foldables-biggest-flaw-2">How new engineering just eliminated the foldables’ biggest flaw</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7ctSG2tqh3hWMzAVmcHWg" name="Pixel 10 Pro Fold" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ctSG2tqh3hWMzAVmcHWg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, incremental breakthroughs in design and durability began redefining the innovation game, giving foldables a stronger edge. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-honor-magic-v5" target="_blank">the Honor Magic V5 </a>is the thinnest foldable on the market, with a folded thickness of 8.8mm and an unfolded thickness of 4.1mm.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-comparison">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> measures 8.9mm when folded and 4.2mm when unfolded. Compare this to the 17.1mm/7.6mm original<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-fold-review"> Galaxy Fold </a>launched in 2019 and to the 12.1mm/5.6mm<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review"> Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> launched in 2024. Even if compared to a non-foldable in Galaxy line-up, it beats Samsung’s thinnest S25 Edge in its unfolded form.</p><p>In terms of durability, the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-early-battery-impressions"> Galaxy Z Fold 7 promises to withstand up to 500,000 folds</a> thanks to enhanced materials and a hinge design, while the Galaxy Z Fold 6 could only handle 200,000 folds. This means a 10-year durability for an average user for the latest version.</p><p>These comparisons show that the consumers’ biggest concern — bulkiness — is no longer a limiting factor. Foldables are slimmer, far more durable, and built to last, making them worth the premium price.</p><h2 id="the-bold-new-form-factor-igniting-global-demand-2">The bold new form factor igniting global demand</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="offCcKLQ2hJztExaULVaFQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/offCcKLQ2hJztExaULVaFQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The comeback narrative doesn’t stop there.

It is the first trifold phone powered by Android and backed by Samsung, the leading name in the foldable category. With its global reach and strong brand power, Samsung is positioned to bring trifold technology to mainstream users faster than Huawei.</p><p>Lacking Android and Google services, Huawei faces entry barriers in markets outside China and, hence, targets China primarily with its Mate XT and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-vs-huawei-mate-xts">Mate XTs</a> trifolds. Despite this setback, together, both models captured a 3.6% unit share of the foldable market in the first three quarters of 2025, while selling over 740,000 units and generating a massive $2B in revenue since their launch. These shares and figures are incredible, given that both models are priced and sold at a hefty $2,500.</p><h2 id="the-2026-turning-point-what-happens-when-apple-finally-enters-the-arena-2">The 2026 turning point: What happens when Apple finally enters the arena?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HmPVR9kvVmKqtX9Lj4zTqf" name="iphone-air-fold-mock-render" alt="Mockup of iPhone Fold based on iPhone Air" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmPVR9kvVmKqtX9Lj4zTqf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As trifold foldables captivate consumers, the real turning point looms in 2026: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/the-iphone-air-doesnt-matter-its-just-a-test">Apple finally steps into the foldable arena</a>, forecasted to gain a 22% unit share and 34% value share of the foldables market in its first year, according to IDC.</p><p>Apple’s ability to sell on a scale to a loyal customer base will certainly translate into healthier growth for the entire foldable space.

A new leak suggests OnePlus is working on a phone with a massive 9,000 mAh battery.</p><p>According to leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/yabhishekhd/">Abhishek Yadav on X</a> (now deleted), OnePlus is developing a smartphone with the codename "Volkswagen." While it is unclear which lineup this upcoming smartphone will fall under, whether the Nord series or something entirely new, the leaker has shared some key specifications of the device.</p><p>The phone is said to feature a dual-camera setup on the back and a sub-6-inch OLED display. Similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-china-launch-official">OnePlus 15</a> and OnePlus 15R, it will reportedly support up to a 165Hz refresh rate.

That said, the standout specification here is not the display or chipset, but the battery capacity.</p><p>According to the leak, the upcoming OnePlus smartphone will pack a huge 9,000 mAh battery with support for up to 80W wired charging. That is more battery capacity than two base models of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> phones combined. If you thought the OnePlus 15R already pushed boundaries with its 7,400 mAh cell, this device could take things even further.</p><p>It appears OnePlus has cracked a battery innovation that many other smartphone brands have yet to figure out, given its recent focus on unusually large batteries. It remains to be seen when, or if, this phone will launch, but our guess is that it could be introduced sometime in Q1 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I don't have any issues with that, and obviously, Android platform releases also go out to Google's devices the moment they're available.</p><p>My issue is with the broader Android ecosystem. Most brands still do a pathetic job with software updates (looking at you, Xiaomi and Motorola), and Google needs to step in and set the terms a little better in these situations. As it stands, there's just no reason for most phone manufacturers to bother with updates, and I want to see that change.</p><p>I'll admit this is getting better with flagships; most brands now deliver updates within a few months of the stable build, and most high-end phones will get at least four platform updates (unless you're using an ASUS phone). But with phone hardware getting much better over the last 18 months, these devices are designed to last the better part of a decade, and the software is more often than not the limiting factor.</p><h2 id="ui-tweaks-a-2">UI tweaks: A</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5009px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="NAbPcBeMTYdT2xqHJr9kFA" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NAbPcBeMTYdT2xqHJr9kFA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5009" height="2821" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like what Google is doing with the Pixel's UI.

As someone who tests a <em>lot</em> of Android phones, there's no consistency or originality when it comes to most interfaces, with most Chinese brands now emulating the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">Liquid Glass design of iOS 26</a>.</p><p>In that context, it's great to see Google have a solid vision for the software and deliver it coherently. I would like the interface to make its way to other Android brands, but I know that's just wishful thinking; after talking to most phone brands, it's clear that they have their own ideology when it comes to the UI.</p><h2 id="ai-everywhere-b-2">AI everywhere: B</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wWeFPGNm5zJHAVajEvLwjG" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-magic-cue-google-messages" alt="A Magic Cue calendar chip in Google Messages on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wWeFPGNm5zJHAVajEvLwjG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most phone brands have AI-assisted features just because it is the buzzword de jour.

The company previously said it would unveil "new AI-driven customer experiences," and as the event approaches, it is becoming clear what one of those innovations will be: Gemini integration in a refrigerator.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-to-unveil-ai-vision-built-with-google-gemini-at-ces-2026">new blog post</a>, Samsung announced it will showcase its latest kitchen appliance lineup at CES 2026.

With Gemini built into the fridge, the company claims it will be able to recognize an even wider range of food items.</p><p>Samsung adds that the new Bespoke AI Refrigerator Family Hub will also recognize processed foods without separate registration, detect user-labeled items, and add foods stored in personal containers directly to the food list.</p><p>Alongside the AI refrigerator, Samsung is also planning to showcase a new Bespoke AI Wine Cellar with integrated Gemini. According to the company, when users store or remove wine bottles, a camera positioned at the top of the unit will recognize labels and track and update the SmartThings AI Wine Manager in real-time.</p><p>The system will also be able to differentiate between specific shelves and compartments where each bottle is placed, making it easier to check locations without searching manually. Users will also be able to look up wine information and receive pairing suggestions based on the bottles in their collection.</p><p>While we are hoping to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-release-date">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> or at least a sneak peek at the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S26 series</a>, the integration of Gemini into refrigerators is certainly interesting. Whether this will prove genuinely useful remains to be seen, but we will find out once we go hands on with these devices during our live coverage from CES 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There is a constant onslaught of new releases, software updates, and industry changes that are shifting and evolving. While the market for Chromebooks and tablets isn't as volatile as smartphones or wearables, 2025 surprised me in a few ways.</p><p>I guess that's to say that I'm thankful that I'm able to look back and review <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/looking-at-the-chromebook-and-tablet-markets-in-2025">what my thoughts were</a> at this time last year. Both Chromebooks and tablets were in a completely different place than they are today, and as 2025 comes to a close, it's time to reflect on how things played out over the past 12 months.</p><h2 id="a-rollercoaster-of-a-year-for-chromebooks-and-chromeos-2">A rollercoaster of a year for Chromebooks and ChromeOS</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5077px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RhNKmxQWajtiPx3YBM8dxc" name="android-rewind-home-page-on-chromebook" alt="Android Rewind on Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RhNKmxQWajtiPx3YBM8dxc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5077" height="2856" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For much of the year, things were fairly quiet with Chromebooks. Really, the first half of the year was more "ho-hum" than I expected, with new Chromebook releases being quite iterative. It wasn't entirely unexpected, as Samsung and Lenovo ended 2024 with a bang thanks to the former's return to the platform after a hiatus, and the latter bringing us another great hybrid option.</p><p>Fundamentally, there weren't many drastic changes made to ChromeOS, as Google shifted its focus to better implementing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> into the system. Little did I know that bigger plans were on the horizon for both the hardware and the software.</p><h2 id="flagship-arm-chips-bring-x86-power-without-sacrificing-battery-life-2">Flagship ARM chips bring x86 power without sacrificing battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="j2J7TyN7RUhn9VL5fHMT9o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-mediatek-kompanio-ultra-sticker" alt="MediaTek Kompanio Ultra logo on Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j2J7TyN7RUhn9VL5fHMT9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The major shift didn't really begin until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on">Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14</a> was revealed in June, offering the "dream" Chromebook with excellent performance and incredible battery life. Lenovo certainly delivered, thanks to the MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910, an ARM chip that goes toe-to-toe with some of the best traditional x86 chips found in Chromebooks.</p><p>Not only does this make for a very snappy Chromebook, but the Kompanio Ultra allowed Google to implement even more on-device Gemini functionality. Up to this point, a few AI tasks could be handled locally, but many still relied on cloud processing, potentially slowing your workflow. That's now changed, as you're now able to perform tasks like editing images with Gemini on your Chromebook.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="DmDoGvHo4WipPbR3c7TJin" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-18" alt="Smart Grouping showcase during Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DmDoGvHo4WipPbR3c7TJin.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It wouldn't be until September that we would see the Kompanio Ultra arrive in another option, as Acer picked up the mantle with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-makes-a-splash-at-ifa-2025-with-the-chromebook-plus-spin-514-and-new-chromeboxes">Chromebook Plus Spin 514</a>. It offers the same level of performance as Lenovo's Chromebook, but has the benefit of sporting a convertible design, whereas the Lenovo sticks to a traditional laptop design.</p><p>Just as impressive, if not more so, is the battery life for these new Chromebooks. Both the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 and Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 are rated to last for up to 17 hours on a single charge. This is a far cry from the 8-10 hours we're used to seeing on many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a> that rely on x86 processors.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-all-sunshine-and-rainbows-in-the-chromebook-world-2">It's not all sunshine and rainbows in the Chromebook world</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vJioWTjQPFy3DjMMzGk8tZ" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-27.jpg" alt="microSD card sticking out of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vJioWTjQPFy3DjMMzGk8tZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it was awesome to see the Kompanio Ultra set a new standard for what Chromebooks should be capable of, only two OEMs are bringing these to the masses.

However, I was frustrated by OEMs' unwillingness to release Chromebooks with higher storage configurations. Some have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card slots</a>, which is great (in theory), but not always reliable.</p><p>I hoped we'd see at least one Chromebook with 1TB of storage, but we didn't even get one with 512GB.

So it's not entirely inconceivable that your brand-new 128GB Chromebook really only has around 100GB of usable space, which simply isn't enough for a daily computing device.</p><p>The other problem is that a memory shortage is already driving up the prices of RAM and storage.

One thing libraries still haven't figured out how to consistently make available to communities at large is digital content. There are plenty of digital libraries available online, but concerns about piracy and proper compensation for media rights holders make the experience complicated. It's a problem Anna's Archive, self-described as "the largest truly open library in human history," is trying to solve.</p><p>In an absolutely stunning twist, Anna's Archive announced it backed up almost all of the music available on Spotify. The Dec. 20 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://annas-archive.org/blog/backing-up-spotify.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> reveals Anna's Archive "discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale," and the team "saw a role for us here to build a music archive primarily aimed at preservation." The data backup contains 86 million music files, which Anna's Archive says represents 99.6% of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify">Spotify</a> listens.</p><p>Anna's Archive began in 2022 as a torrent aggregator and search engine for primarily text-based files stored across LibGen, Sci-Hub, Z-Lib, and other torrents. It emerged in response to U.S. government efforts to shut down Z-Library. The group, made up on anonymous contributors, now wants to create something similar for music.</p><p>Understandably, Spotify isn't happy with the reports of Anna's Archive scraping its music files, with the company calling out the use of "illicit tactics" to bypass <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-drm-android-apps">DRM</a> and copyright protections. A ton of questions remain, like whether Spotify or regulators will attempt to take legal actions against Anna's Archive, or if a "free" database of Spotify songs will be made available for the average listener.</p><p>The massive music backup, unlike anything we've ever seen before, is going to force companies, regulators, and users to answer the following question: what separates preservation from piracy?</p><h2 id="what-anna-s-archive-managed-to-back-up-2">What Anna's Archive managed to back up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="t9wAivbKyuqhceHsoKZMfB" name="Spotify" alt="Spotify icon on Find X9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t9wAivbKyuqhceHsoKZMfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4072" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anna's Archive said it chose to back up Spotify tracks based on the company's own popularity metric. There are a ton of songs on Spotify that get virtually zero listens. For perspective, the archive estimates the top three songs on Spotify were streamed more than the bottom 20 to 100 million songs combined. In all, the backup includes metadata from 256 million tracks and audio files for 86 million songs.</p><p>Spotify defines its popularity metric as "a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular." It's calculated by an algorithm that's "based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are."</p><p>Using this categorization, Anna's Archive backed up the 86 million most-popular songs, which accounts for 37% of Spotify's entire catalog. However, it also makes up 99.6% of listens. In other words, while the archive backed up less than half of Spotify songs, it covers almost all of the tracks people actually listen to.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="SxVePJthiStuJ4aLAuMiuT" name="Annas-Archive-Spotify-Archive" alt="The popularity distribution for music files archived by Anna's Archive from Spotify." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SxVePJthiStuJ4aLAuMiuT.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anna's Archive)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Anna's Archive backed up Spotify metadata for 99.9% of tracks, making it the largest music metadata archive in the world, it stopped at only 37% of Spotify music files due to storage constraints. The 86 million archived songs represent 300TB of storage, and the rest would've required 700TB of additional storage "for minor benefit," according to the blog post.</p><p>The music files are formatted in OGG Vorbis at 160kbps for songs with a popularity metric greater than zero. Songs with a popularity of zero were re-encoded in OGG Vorbis at 75kbps. Anna's Archive added metadata to the audio files, including "including title, url, ISRC, UPC, album art, and replaygain information." Audio files typically contain no metadata of their own, so this is significant.</p><h2 id="spotify-says-this-is-just-scraping-using-illicit-tactics-2">Spotify says this is just scraping using 'illicit tactics'</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5095px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="G5PpFQXAKCzqifgyUbWDpB" name="Spotify" alt="Spotify Premium Platinum plan details in India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G5PpFQXAKCzqifgyUbWDpB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5095" height="2870" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We have to point out that Anna's Archive backup is illegal for a variety of reasons.

By definition, the Anna's Archive music backup is piracy.</p><p>Spotify seems to agree, as it made statements to both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-annas-archive-3627023/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/worlds-largest-shadow-library-brags-it-scraped-300tb-of-spotify-music-metadata/" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a> commenting on the Anna's Archive release.</p><p>"An investigation into unauthorized access identified that a third party scraped public metadata and used illicit tactics to circumvent DRM to access some of the platform’s audio files," Spotify told Android Authority. "We are actively investigating the incident."</p><p>Notably, Spotify doesn't confirm the scope of the Anna's Archive backup, only saying that "some" of the site's audio files were accessed. In a separate statement, Spotify said it is taking action to prevent something like this from happening again.</p><p>"We've implemented new safeguards for these types of anti-copyright attacks and are actively monitoring for suspicious behavior," a Spotify spokesperson told Ars Technica. "Since day one, we have stood with the artist community against piracy, and we are actively working with our industry partners to protect creators and defend their rights."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XDtnK264C4iAnNGKy7pd2S" name="spotify-pixel-4xl-lifestyle.jpeg" alt="Spotify on the Pixel 4 XL." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XDtnK264C4iAnNGKy7pd2S.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Anna's Archive cites altruistic motivations as their reasons for trying to "preserve" Spotify's music catalog, there are major concerns for artists, record labels, and streaming services. The backup could create ways for listeners to stream music without paying for it, hurting the music industry. As it is currently released, it would be difficult for the average listener to find or stream individual songs within the 300TB backup, but that could change.</p><p>"For now this is a torrents-only archive aimed at preservation, but if there is enough interest, we could add downloading of individual files to Anna’s Archive," the archive's blog post notes. "Please let us know if you’d like this."</p><p>It's currently unclear what, if any, legal action could be taken against Anna's Archive as a result of this move. Theoretically, the archive's decentralized network structure prevents it from being shuttered completely. However, when it comes to music, there's a lot of money on the line — giving rights holders and regulators incentive to protect copyrighted material.</p><p>In September 2025, the Internet Archive settled a lawsuit claiming it served as an "illegal record store" for 4,000 songs (via Reuters). As a reminder, Anna's Archive just backed up 86 million.</p><h2 id="is-this-preservation-or-piracy-2">Is this preservation or piracy? </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1999px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="N8YDEEixyqyFevodQ3Ni8L" name="Spotify-hero-android.jpg" alt="Spotify logo on an Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8YDEEixyqyFevodQ3Ni8L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1999" height="1124" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a music enjoyer and someone who closely follows the industry, I see both sides here. There is a valid argument to be made for the need to preserve digital media.</p><p>On a high level, songs can quickly become "lost media" without preservation — lost media is usually defined as "any type of media thought to no longer exist in any format, or for which no copies can be located, partial or otherwise." The idea of music becoming lost media is terrifying, and if archival can prevent that from happening, a preservation angle starts to make sense.</p><p>Just this month, Taylor Swift replaced the original versions of two songs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-reputation-lyric-changes-explained-1235483070/" target="_blank">with new recordings with altered lyrics</a>. Without physical media or digital archives, those original recordings could disappear forever.</p><p>Another reason I buy the altruistic goal of the Anna's Archive backup is the quality of the songs scraped. At 160kbps, the highest-quality songs are very low-quality, making them less appealing to listeners. These music files are lower-quality than 256kbps AAC and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tech-talk-what-is-lossless-audio">far worse than any lossless format</a>. The archive could've backed up fewer songs at higher quality, but it didn't, which tells me this really was about preservation.</p><p>Here's the problem: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-shouldnt-steal-ebooks-unless-you-have-good-lawyers">from a legal perspective, it doesn't matter</a>. This is piracy according to U.S. copyright law. I can't tell you whether Anna's Archive is correct on a moral or ethical basis, but I can tell you its actions are illegal. And if the songs stripped from Spotify are made easily available for consumers as an alternative to paying for music, it could do irreparable harm to the music industry.</p><p>Android Central does not condone the sharing or distribution of copyrighted material.

Last week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-gemini-now-integrates-seamlessly-with-notebooklm-for-improved-project-management">Gemini gained direct NotebookLM integration</a> that allows users to pull their notebooks and sources into a Gemini conversation. Other recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-now-turns-your-source-material-into-tables-ready-for-google-sheets" target="_blank">improvements include Data Tables</a>, which are a quick way to visualize information and export it to Google Sheets. Now, Google is officially confirming that NotebookLM runs on the latest and best Gemini models.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/NotebookLM/status/2002115447425282449" target="_blank">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), the NotebookLM account revealed that "NotebookLM is officially built on Gemini 3." Google calls Gemini 3 its "most intelligent model," adding that the change "brings significant improvements to NotebookLM's reasoning and multimodal understanding."</p><p>The switch to Gemini 3 was a highly-requested feature that came up "3x more than anything else," according to Google. Previously, NotebookLM was based on the Gemini 2.5 Flash mode. To use the latest Gemini 3 Flash and Pro models, NotebookLM users needed to switch to the Gemini app. Gemini 3 now powers the AI features within the NotebookLM app, including the chatbot, making it easier to access straight from user projects.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Checking your holiday wishlists, there's one request that's coming up 3x more than anything else... 🥁NotebookLM is OFFICIALLY built on Gemini 3!Google's most intelligent model, this brings significant improvements to NotebookLM's reasoning and multimodal understanding.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/2002115447425282449">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>It's not clear whether NotebookLM is using Gemini 3 Pro or Gemini 3 Flash, the quicker and lightweight AI model just announced last week. Historically, NotebookLM has included the Flash versions of new Gemini models, so Gemini 3 Flash is a safe bet.</p><p>If the studying and learning app is indeed powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-flash-googles-lightweight-ai-model-stuns-with-raw-speed-in-ai-mode-and-more">Gemini 3 Flash</a>, it would be a major upgrade. This model delivers "frontier intelligence built for speed at a fraction of the cost" and outperforms Gemini 2.5 Pro, according to Google. However, Google says NotebookLM now possesses better multimodal reasoning and understanding, which could point to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-pro-googles-new-ai-model-aims-to-redefine-multimodal-understanding">Gemini 3 Pro</a> working behind the scenes.</p><p>Either way, a fast and powerful Gemini 3 model is now powering the AI features in your NotebookLM projects. You can try it now in the app, although there isn't a model picker or badge showing the change, as is typical for NotebookLM. The latest model switch continues a busy month for NotebookLM updates, which also included <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-starts-rolling-out-chat-history-but-only-on-the-web">chat history support on mobile and the web</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company stated that Magic Cue will leverage relevant information from all of your apps when you're calling or texting. Magic Cue can pull from Gmail, Calendar, Screenshots, Messages, and others. For example, if you're texting someone and they ask for a screenshot, Magic Cue would see it and suggest opening Google Photos.</p><p>If someone wants to know what time your flight leaves or arrives, Magic Cue would grab those details from Gmail for you and have them ready in your clipboard to paste.</p><p>Since Magic Cue is so intimately involved in your business, Google says users don't have to enable it if they don't want to. However, if you do, you have full control over your data with options to delete any. Google offered comfort to users by saying their data is processed "securely and privately" with Gemini.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to its sources, the Exynos 2600 does not feature an "integrated" modem. It's because of this reason that the report claims the phones could sport an external modem, but that could rip their efficiency.</p><p>Nothing is confirmed yet, as these are rumors, but the publication explained how consumers <em>could </em>get a less power-efficient Galaxy S26.</p><p>The publication states that, in an integrated design, Samsung could save on wiring and space, facilitating a chip that demands less power and runs cooler. However, if the phones (and chip) separate the modem into its own area, then "lower power efficiency and higher heat generation" are a possibility. The post highlights an industry member who speculates that the "number of functions inside the AP increased" within the Exynos 2600, causing Samsung to "remove the modem to secure space."</p><p>Still, this source still offered caution about the potential "performance-to-power" capability of the new flagship series, should this less-efficient phone rumor prove true.</p><h2 id="there-are-concerns-2">There are concerns</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hJL2Juqhxjc8Fb7foWDEMY" name="exynos-2600-main-1" alt="Exynos 2600 chipset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hJL2Juqhxjc8Fb7foWDEMY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-exynos-2600-official">Exynos 2600 launched</a> on December 19 after Samsung teased its upcoming debut earlier this month. This SoC is the first 2nm process product of its kind, rocking low-power CPU cores and a new CPU layout that should produce higher performance levels and better efficiency. Getting into specifics, the Exynos 2600 boasts a 39% CPU upgrade with double the GPU capability.</p><p>What's more exciting is that Samsung equipped the Exynos 2600 with an HPB design (Heat Path Block). The HPB is said to help solve those heating concerns that previously plagued quite a few of Samsung's custom chips.</p><p>Everything combined is what we should keep our eyes on with these "less-efficient" Galaxy S26 rumors. Android Authority speculated something similar, stating that Samsung could've packed enough upgrades into the SoC to offset any issues that might arise from a separated modem. If that happens, then consumers might not notice a difference.

This phone launched back in July 2024, so naturally, I expected that all the major flagships of 2025 would follow suit. Oddly enough, things did not play out that way.</p><p>See, phone makers struggled with Qi2 adoption, and what we did end up seeing, at least at the beginning of the year, was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25" target="_blank">the Galaxy S25 series</a>, which both require magnetic cases to support magnetic charging, and only the latter technically supports the Qi2 spec. My guess is that they couldn't figure out how to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">redesign the devices' internals</a> to accommodate magnets without disrupting other features.</p><p>For instance, we discovered that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultras-s-pen-gets-wonky-with-magnetic-accessories-on">S Pen does not work well with magnets</a>.

All Pixel 10 models support magnetic Qi2 — dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a> by Google — natively, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>. Google's Pixelsnap adoption spurred another wave of Qi2 accessories to hit the shelves, including some really cool first-party offerings from Google itself.</p><p>The Qi2 accessory market is bigger than ever, with almost every single name brand adding support for it in their new products.

There's no point in having the feature if your phone doesn't support it properly. Now that Google has moved towards magnetic Qi2, I'm hoping the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">S26 series</a> and other Android flagships of 2026 will do the same.</p><h2 id="i-had-such-high-hopes-for-bluetooth-auracast-2">I had such high hopes for Bluetooth Auracast</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="vRWD3UZkitrSbW2bPQbNKi" name="audio-sharing-via-bluetooth-auracast-google-pixel-10-pro-lifestyle" alt="Audio sharing via Bluetooth Auracast on a Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vRWD3UZkitrSbW2bPQbNKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2916" height="1640" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I truly thought that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast</a> would finally become mainstream in 2025. And yet, here we are. Yes, many smartphones support the feature now, but it's usually buried deep within the phone's settings and ends up going unused.</p><p>Another big issue with Bluetooth Auracast is that audio accessory brands haven't prioritized it as much in 2025. While bigger, more expensive brands such as Marshall and Sony have added Bluetooth to their latest releases, most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">headphones</a> don't support it (yet).</p><p>I admire smaller companies like EarFun that have gone the extra mile and added Auracast support to their 2025 launches.

I honestly expected everyone and their grandmother to be making full use of Auracast broadcasts.</p><p>Bluetooth Auracast requires users to go deep into their audio device settings and enable Bluetooth LE. Then, you have to set up a password and share your broadcast with the public. It gets even more complicated when your connected Bluetooth accessory does not show you how to switch to the LE mode.

As it stands, the audio sharing feature is very convoluted. It won't be popular unless the feature is user-friendly.

The original poster (OP), DizzyCaregiver4126, states that after installing the update, "the camera behaves normally at first, but when switching to 50MP mode, the image suddenly becomes very blurry and out of focus." The user notes that this issue did not occur before, but the update has caused it to happen "consistently."</p><p>The OP states that they're encountering this issue with their Pixel 8 Pro. Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1ppxzpr/comment/nurvq9w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">another user</a> snapped a screenshot of their blurry camera, saying their device experiences a "fluttery quiver" when trying to focus at 1x and 2x.</p><p>Devices aren't reportedly struggling when zooming in at .5x and 10x ranges.</p><p>More users have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1ppxzpr/comment/nv6dijq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">chimed in on</a> the Reddit thread, adding that this issue is occurring when using their Pixel's 50MP camera. One report says that they can alleviate the issue by swapping to their 12MP lens, but that's not entirely ideal for every situation. Even the original poster says that the issue occurs with the 50MP lens. The problem is also (kind of) solved by tapping your display to manually focus, but it quickly goes blurry.</p><p>The publication hopped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/469938426">into the IssueTracker</a> and noted that Google is aware of the issues.

This issue was outside of Google's Android 16 test environment, as the Camera API's EIS (electronic image stabilization) was having a difficult time. Users reported that, while attempting to record, their device's camera was incredibly shaky. This happened noticeably at 5x and 2x zooms.</p><p>The issue here is that EIS is intended to smooth those movements, so they don't appear in the final product.

Every single company announced a multitude of news and products, and Android Central had an incredible year covering the technology you use daily. <br><br>We saw great strides in how companies have evolved AI, and many companies launched new products that could be the future. We took the time to reflect on the year and think about what we want 2026 to look like.<br><br>This end-of-year special is split up into three sections. For the first time this year, Android Central's staff decided to give out report cards. We looked at what we wrote at the end of 2024 and asked ourselves: Did companies meet our expectations for 2025? Were they able to fulfil some of our predictions?</p><p>We also took the time to think about 2026. What do we hope to see, what kind of launches do we want, what do we expect of the companies we cover every single day? Surprisingly, this has turned into a fun experiment. At the end of 2026, will these companies meet our expectations?</p><p>Along with this, we want to show our appreciation towards those companies that released stellar products. Our team has put a lot of effort into voting and narrowing down our winners of this past year into several categories, so we hope you enjoy it.</p><p>Congratulations to all the winners!

It sports a fairly lightweight design that's easy to wear, a wide range of fitness features like Training Effect, Garmin Coach, and Recovery Time displays, and all-systems GNSS for optimal tracking accuracy.</p><p>While you can go even cheaper with the Forerunner 55, the 165 comes with a better heart rate sensor, HRV data, blood oxygen data, and the aforementioned GNSS system. It also comes with a cool toggleable display that can switch back and forth from AMOLED and MIP modes.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.99" data-dimension48="$249.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0CT3SGHXL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1599px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="aAeAbTE78C6rGwUtc58g6Z" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-black" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aAeAbTE78C6rGwUtc58g6Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1599" height="1599" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Garmin Forerunner 165:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0CT3SGHXL" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.99" data-dimension48="$249.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$249.99</del> <strong>$199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The affordable Garmin Forerunner 165 is currently $50 off as the holidays approach, marking a 20% discount and bringing the price down to just $200. While it isn't the cheapest of Garmin's lineup, it's probably about as cheap as we'd recommend going for anyone who wants a robust portfolio of running, cycling, and other workout programs.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Forerunner-Smartwatch-Colorful-Training/dp/B0CT3SGHXL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$249.99" data-dimension48="$249.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin smartwatch</a> for under $200 that has a wide range of running and exercise programs, sensors, and additional capabilities; you like being able to switch between the dim MIP display and a bright, hyper-functional AMOLED-style display; you want something with a sporty design that isn't too bulky.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're already a serious athlete who is entrenched in more premium fitness watches, and you'd rather not go with the best affordable Garmin watch; you'd consider upgrading to many of Garmin's more expensive options for advanced feature sets; you need a watch with more than 4GB of music storage.</p><p>The Garmin Forerunner 165 fits well into the company's lineup as an affordable, entry-level point into the smartwatch world. It features the hyper-accurate GNSS tracking, several programs for running, cycling, and more, and a long battery life that's suitable for longer-term outdoor adventures. Even with the low price tag, it still offers about 19 hours of battery with GPS tracking on, or 11 days in smartwatch mode. Our tests revealed the GNSS systems to be as accurate as they claimed, and we love the daily suggested workouts, race-adaptive training, and Garmin Coach features.</p><p>As for sensors, the Forerunner 165 includes an accelerometer, an altimeter, the Elevate v4 HRM heart rate system, Sp02, and a Pulse Ox sensor. Additionally, it sports a compass and an ambient light, as well as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and 4GB of onboard music storage.</p><p>To be sure, the 165 is a big step up for Garmin from past iterations, especially because of its accuracy in both GPS tracking and health monitoring systems, and $50 off doesn't hurt either.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google took 2025 to change the way you think about AI on your phone, and the company is doing a good job of making you care. They’re just... not there yet.

Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series has changed that, and the new Redmi Note 15 Pro and 15 Pro+ 5G take it further with strong durability and longer-lasting batteries.</p><p>On the outside, the Note 15 Pro models look similar to their predecessors. The phones are still big, flat, and clearly Redmi. What’s new is Xiaomi’s focus on durability. Now, both phones have IP66, IP68, IP69, and IP69K ratings, plus SGS-certified drop resistance and Gorilla Glass Victus 2. This is a big step up from the Redmi Note 14 series, which had good protection but not at this level.</p><p>So what do all those ratings mean for you? These phones can handle high-pressure, high-temperature water jets. You still get Gorilla Glass Victus 2 like on the Redmi Note 14 Pro series, but the Note 15 Pro’s “Titan Structure” means the phones pack "a high-strength motherboard, a reinforced mid-frame with high thermal conductivity, and shock-absorbing enhancements across seven key components for exceptional structural durability."</p><h2 id="silicon-carbon-is-the-new-battery-standard-2">Silicon-carbon is the new battery standard</h2><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-14-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 14 Pro+</a> already had a big battery, but the Note 15 Pro+ goes further with a 6,500mAh silicon-carbon battery in a slim body. The standard Note 15 Pro offers even more, with a 6,580mAh battery.</p><p>This is a big jump from the 5,110mAh battery in earlier models. The Pro+ supports 100W HyperCharge, and Xiaomi claims the battery will stay usable for six years, but actual results may vary depending on how you use it.</p><p>The processing power has also improved. The Note 14 Pro+ used the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, but the Note 15 Pro+ now uses the Snapdragon 7s Gen 4.</p><p>For the standard Pro model, Redmi replaced the Note 14’s Dimensity 7300-Ultra with the newer Dimensity 7400-Ultra. To prevent overheating during gaming, the Pro+ uses a new Xiaomi IceLoop system with a stainless steel loop pump.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:84.15%;"><img id="XWVMdCNsHqxPvnu8HFYRAk" name="Redmi-Note-15-Pro-series-1" alt="Silver and brown rear panels of the Redmi Note 15 Pro and Pro Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XWVMdCNsHqxPvnu8HFYRAk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3016" height="2538" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="offline-calling-is-a-standout-feature-2">Offline calling is a standout feature</h2><p>There is also a new feature not found on the Note 14 or most other phones in this price range: Xiaomi Offline Communication.</p><p>Both Note 15 models have a special chip that lets you make voice calls over long distances without network coverage. If you hike, camp, or worry about losing signal in emergencies, this feature is a strong reason to upgrade. This feature requires a SIM card and a logged-in Xiaomi account to operate.</p><p>The Note 15 Pro+ keeps its quad-curved look, now called a Liquid Display, while the standard Pro has a flat screen that many users prefer. Both screens reach up to 3,200 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>The main camera is still 200MP, but the Note 15 series now includes more advanced AI features like Google Gemini and AI Erase Pro out of the box.</p><p>The Redmi Note 15 Pro will be available in Titanium, Glacier Blue, Mist Purple, and Black at a starting price of €399/£349. The Pro+ will come in Mocha Brown, Glacier Blue, and Black, starting at €499/£429. Preorders for both models will start in January 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="end-of-year-report-card-c-2">End of year report card: C</h2><p>In 2024, I took a look at some exciting consumer audio technologies and what I really wanted to see in 2025. Some things I didn’t see coming, like Spotify finally offering lossless audio streaming! I’m <em><strong>still</strong></em> shocked that it actually happened. Some things, like Auracast, saw some growth, but widespread adoption still left me a bit underwhelmed, given the technology’s powerful potential.</p><p>So, let’s take a look at what I saw in the consumer audio market in 2025 and grade how well manufacturers met the expectations I had at the end of 2024.</p><h2 id="these-things-were-mostly-misses-in-2025-2">These things were mostly misses in 2025</h2><p>I began my 2024 end-of-year look-ahead with two quality-of-life features that are “must-haves”: offline voice control and live translation. Samsung was at the top of my list for both features in 2024, and sadly, not many others have put earbuds on the market with on-device voice controls.</p><p>To recap, on-device voice controls shouldn’t be confused with connecting to an AI agent like Google Assistant/Gemini, Alexa, or Siri. On-device voice controls let you interact with basic earbud features without using a wake word or an internet connection through your phone. They were a game-changer during my time with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>.</p><p>Yes, there are devices with head gesture controls in the wild, but outside of Apple’s AirPods lineup or Sony’s Linkbuds Fit, they’re a rare find when it comes to earbuds you can fully use with your Android devices.</p><p>All is not lost, though! In December 2025, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/this-is-everything-in-google-translates-three-big-updates-rolling-out-for-android">expanded live translation capabilities</a> to almost any Bluetooth or pair of wired headphones via a beta update to the Translate app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wArqLbyY8wWWZQvq9ECQ2b" name="pixel-buds-pro-2-vs-galaxy-buds-3-pro-hero" alt="An image showing Galaxy Buds3 Pro vs Pixel Buds Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wArqLbyY8wWWZQvq9ECQ2b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google Pixel Buds Pro2 and Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have compelling live translate features </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In 2025, Google and Samsung finally baked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-and-gn-showcase-auracasts-potential-for-enhanced-hearing-accessibility">Auracast</a> support into some Galaxy and Pixel phones, giving you the ability to listen in on and stream audio to multiple Bluetooth LE headphones and earbuds that support Auracast. The problem is that the most significant promise of the technology, which is its use in stadiums, museums, and other public spaces, has yet to materialize.</p><p>There are select venues around the world, like the Sydney Opera House in Australia and the Marriott Theater in Chicago, Illinois, that have Auracast installations, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/ask-jerry-can-auracast-help-me">allowing hearing-challenged people</a> to get the full bandwidth of <em>musical sound</em> that traditional hearing aids don’t reproduce, but easily finding venues with Auracast support is like playing “Where’s Waldo?”</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2989px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Au4bqA9SCDYzByH5PpBxAH" name="EarFun-Clip-open-ear-earbuds-lifestyle-ear-shots-2" alt="EarFun Clip open-ear earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Au4bqA9SCDYzByH5PpBxAH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2989" height="1681" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Arguably, 2025 was the year that saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open earbud</a> designs come into their own and multiply like rabbits. It feels like almost everyone brought a pair of open earbuds to market.

Many of those same companies also put out more traditional open earbuds with transducers that sit over your ears instead of inside your ear canals, and they, too, saw improvements in overall sound quality. I no longer believe that open earbuds are useless when compared to just using traditional earbuds and their transparency modes.</p><h2 id="innovation-in-design-and-health-forward-hardware-2">Innovation in design and health-forward hardware</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TR6hSZhTmQtSCFhDuuAaY" name="Nothing-Headphone-1-7" alt="The Nothing Headphone 1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TR6hSZhTmQtSCFhDuuAaY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I miss the days when manufacturers took chances with their designs.

More affordable, high-quality active-listening “audiophile” gear reached the masses. Lossless audio saw wider adoption. Nothing brought their A game to the design table.

Ultimately, though, I had more fun with audio in 2025 than I had frustrations or disappointments.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Some skeptics warned that AI development would hit a "wall" this year. Others worried that companies like Google and Apple were overpromising, leaving them vulnerable to underdelivering.</p><p>I made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/2025-the-year-ai-finds-purpose-on-phones-smartwatches-tablets">a few predictions</a> at the end of last year, and most of them seem to have panned out. AI has arrived on operating systems in short order, and it's becoming more agentic and actionable. I was wrong about a few things, too — namely, Samsung shocked me by making it clear which Galaxy AI features run on- and off-device, allowing Galaxy users to disable online features with a single toggle.</p><p>Now that 2025 is nearing its conclusion, let's grade how the AI industry as a whole and some of its biggest companies fared.</p><h2 id="reviewing-my-predictions-for-ai-in-2025-2">Reviewing my predictions for AI in 2025</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8" name="google-gemini-lock-screen-widgets-iphone-16-pro-max" alt="Google Gemini lock screen widgets on iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Following the colossal failure of dedicated AI devices like the Humane AI Pin or Rabbit R1, I correctly predicted the industry would pivot and try to put AI directly into our mobile operating systems.</p><p>Google led the charge, adding Gemini <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-continues-pushing-out-google-assistant-in-a-steady-rebrand-effort">as a permanent Google Assistant replacement</a> across Android, Wear OS, and more. Microsoft's Copilot is the heart of Windows, and Apple is still trying (but failing) to make Apple Intelligence the architect of iOS and macOS.</p><p>That said,<strong> </strong>it's wild to me that Gemini Live's multimodal video and screen sharing <em>only</em> debuted in 2025, considering how quickly it's become an instrumental Android feature. At this point last year, multimodal Gemini Live video was only a prototype as Project Astra. Not only did Project Astra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-lives-video-streaming-screen-sharing-support-comes-to-pixel-9-series" target="_blank">go public on Pixel devices</a> as expected, but it also came to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users" target="_blank">basically every Android device</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-3" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google checked the multimodal box with Gemini Live, and the combination of audio, visual, and text-based inputs has become a common way to use AI. Agentic control developed a bit slower than I expected, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-gemini-agent-can-orchestrate-complex-tasks-on-your-behalf-in-the-gemini-app">Gemini Agent</a> and the agent-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-antigravitys-rate-limits-are-changing-amid-incredible-demand">Google Antigravity app</a> only materializing of late. OpenAI's AgentKit debuted similarly late in October. Alas, it's clear AI agents are the current goal for the biggest companies.</p><p>I was hopeful that we'd see more AI features built right into the OS, ideally using more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI</a>. That doesn't seem to have happened. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Nano</a> still handles some on-device processing for Pixels, and the same is true for Galaxy AI on Samsung phones, but growth is slower than I expected.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QtzggC8Tac4y3VobHhwTYd" name="Remix-Google-Messages" alt="Using the Remix feature in Google Messages on a Samsung phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QtzggC8Tac4y3VobHhwTYd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In late 2024, both the CEOs of Google and OpenAI pushed back on the idea that AI would hit a "wall." I didn't think progress would stall; rather, I thought companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google would all challenge each other to be better. That happened, with these companies trading places on leading AI benchmarks throughout 2025.</p><p>I also expected the lines between on-device and off-device processing would continue to blur. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/every-android-flagship-should-steal-this-ai-feature-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung proved me wrong</a> by adding a toggle that lets you choose whether to process AI data only on your device. I'm still waiting for other companies to follow suit, though.</p><h2 id="google-in-2025-a-2">Google in 2025: A</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3514px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8Choy7Jzqxrcy9apc2nrra" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Gemini-Raise-to-Talk" alt="Gemini Raise to Talk on the Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Choy7Jzqxrcy9apc2nrra.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3514" height="1977" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google had a major year for AI in 2025. The company seems to be finally firing on all cylinders, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ive-tested-gemini-3-and-it-proves-google-has-what-it-takes-to-win-the-ai-race">Gemini 3 is the culmination of that</a>. It hit milestone after milestone this year, growing Gemini's monthly active user count to nearly 350 million as of November.</p><p>The bigger moment for me was when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/hey-siri-wheres-apple-intelligence-gemini-is-now-the-top-free-app-on-ios">Gemini briefly became the number one free app</a> on the <em>iPhone </em>App Store. It's easy for Gemini to succeed on Google platforms where it's placed front and center. But on iOS, where users have to actively seek Gemini instead of convenient options like Apple Intelligence with ChatGPT integration? Gemini's success there is an outstanding sign of what's to come for Google.</p><p>Over 150 million accounts are subscribed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Pro</a>. It's monetizing the experience with advertising tests in AI Overviews and AI Mode in Google Search, and it's earning revenue from AI dev tools via Google Cloud.</p><p>In terms of features, Google released more than I can recap in this article. Some highlights include Gemini Live's video and screen-sharing support, the Google Antigravity AI-based IDE, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/tech-talk-what-the-heck-is-gemini-nano-banana">Nano Banana</a> image generator. I'll also tip my cap to Google for continuing to make tons of AI features available for free, including on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-for-homes-early-access-program-will-now-let-anyone-in-within-24-hours">discontinued smart home devices</a>.</p><p>Really, it's hard to pick apart Google's AI strategy this year, which is why I'm giving it an A grade. If I had to nitpick, I'd say I'm concerned Google isn't making brand partnerships — like Meta's integration with Garmin or OpenAI's deal with Disney — as these may prove important heading into 2026.</p><h2 id="openai-in-2025-b-2">OpenAI in 2025: B-</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="W2CK2WE8g9kEHTCzyBUj3P" name="chatgpt-kotor-ii-galaxy-z-fold-6" alt="ChatGPT Live Conversation transcript about KOTOR II on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W2CK2WE8g9kEHTCzyBUj3P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OpenAI feels like a company retooling and looking toward the future rather than aggressively building AI products <em>right now</em>. The company is making a handful of long-term bets that could make its 2026 look a lot better than the B- grade it's looking today. However, as it stands now, OpenAI's market share is being chipped away at by competitors, and its leading GPT-5.1 and now GPT-5.2 models are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard" target="_blank">struggling in benchmarks</a> and among users.</p><p>While ChatGPT still has a gigantic user base compared to the competition, at nearly 900 million monthly active users, its priorities feel questionable. ChatGPT <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/group-chats-in-chatgpt/" target="_blank">recently added group chats</a>, as if we needed another DM inbox. And there are signs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/signs-in-chatgpts-code-suggest-android-users-are-in-for-an-influx-of-ads">the ChatGPT app could be flooded with ads</a> based on early reports.</p><p>On the other hand, OpenAI is valued at $500 billion, giving it significant power. The company successfully restructured <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgv38py7ewo" target="_blank">to become a for-profit entity</a>, a bigger feat than any AI model or feature it could've released in 2025 (even if the departure from non-profit status feels questionable to outsiders).</p><p>OpenAI partnered with one of the greatest designers of our lifetime, Jony Ive, and has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/jony-ive-and-sam-altman-confirm-openai-finally-has-a-prototype-for-its-super-secret-ai-device-set-to-launch-in-less-than-2-years" target="_blank">a working prototype of</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/jony-ive-and-sam-altman-confirm-openai-finally-has-a-prototype-for-its-super-secret-ai-device-set-to-launch-in-less-than-2-years"> </a>its upcoming AI device. It made a deal with Disney that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/disney-hits-google-with-a-cease-and-desist-over-ai-copyright-claims">turned the Mickey Mouse brand against Google</a>, and in the process, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/disney-invests-usd1-billion-in-openai-to-put-mickey-mouse-inside-your-text-prompts" target="_blank">OpenAI received a $1 billion investment</a> from Disney. The fleecing makes Sora easily <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/openai-sora-video-generator-vs-google-veo-3">the best consumer-facing AI video-generation</a> product.</p><p>I'll state it plainly — if OpenAI uses its for-profit status to its advantage, builds a killer AI device with Ive, and Disney becomes Sora's ace, we could easily look back on 2025 as a great year for the company. For now, there simply aren't enough results to justify giving OpenAI more than a B- grade.</p><h2 id="the-rest-in-2025-c-2">The rest in 2025: C</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6oF22aDs6FXHcMDZjjiZ64" name="DeepSeek" alt="In-hand view of DeepSeek AI Assistant running on Nubia Z70 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6oF22aDs6FXHcMDZjjiZ64.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The grade "C" is supposedly average, and just about every other AI company not named Google or OpenAI was average in 2025.</p><p>The lone exception in my book is Meta, which earns a B grade. It's making the best face-worn multimodal AI technology with Meta smart glasses. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-garmin-integration-on-oakley-meta-vanguard-glasses-heres-good-bad-and-ugly">Garmin integration with Meta AI</a> is genuinely amazing.</p><p>The problem? Meta is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-needs-to-stop-the-ai-slop-before-it-kills-its-best-products">shoving AI everywhere its users don't want it</a>, and turned the Meta smart glasses companion app into an endless scroll feed for AI slop. The move is so bad that I'm tempted to give Meta an F grade for this alone, but I'll be fair and give it a B for how far Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses are ahead of the competition.</p><p>Apple and Samsung were strictly average in 2025, with neither releasing game-changing new features. Apple correctly avoided overpromising this year, which I give it credit for. The flip side is that it didn't release anything of note on the AI front, either. For Samsung, its best AI features can be traced back to Google.</p><p>On the AI model front, there were bright spots from unlikely candidates, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek</a>. But it faded into obscurity just as quickly as it became popular.</p><h2 id="final-verdict-2">Final verdict</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd" name="google-gemini-claude-chatgpt-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-google-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro on the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, ChatGPT on the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Claude on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qfhgRE4cbo6gDd98HUwdMd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If it came down to a coin toss, I'm inclined to lower AI's overall grade for 2025, regardless of how far the technology has come. That's why I'm only giving AI a B grade for the year, even though over a billion people are using platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot. The reason? We were sold a bill of goods that simply hasn't materialized.</p><p>The year 2025 is now coming to a close, and we haven't seen anything close to artificial general intelligence (AGI). We haven't cured cancer or eliminated poverty. All the while, AI is using more and more finite resources, leading to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-impacts-data-centers-water-data/" target="_blank">water drought concerns</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/dell/dell-commercial-pc-price-hike-ram">global RAM shortages</a>. Layoffs are mounting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-layoffs-hit-again-hundreds-in-android-and-pixel-teams-impacted">by the tens of thousands</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-admits-ai-might-be-moving-too-fast">even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman now says</a> he's "worried about the rate of change that's happening in the world right now."</p><p>So, yes, AI models and interfaces are more powerful than ever in 2025. But let's face it — few are truly excited by AI writing your emails or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-creating-tv-ads-with-ai-watch-the-first-one-for-ai-mode-in-search">generating a bad TV commercial</a>. We were sold a life-changing technology, and three years after ChatGPT debuted, it's clear AI is still far from fitting the bill. With this context, an overall B grade is the absolute highest I can give AI for 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, a new leak is challenging that, especially for the Plus model.</p><p>The prevailing leaks claim the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/leaked-cad-renders-give-first-look-at-samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-design">Galaxy S26 Plus will stick to the 6.7-inch display</a>, just like before. But a new leak from Tech Informer on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1277734824374438&id=100064137967491" target="_blank">Facebook</a> suggests Samsung could increase the Plus model’s screen to 6.9 inches, matching the Ultra’s size.</p><p>This leak offers more than just a bigger screen. Both the leaked image and recent reports now agree on a major change: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-accessories-leak">MagSafe support</a>, or more accurately, Qi2. This isn’t just about magnetic cases anymore — it looks like built-in magnetic arrays are coming.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:512px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="FqdqJvJeQ2rb3URhSG7ZgY" name="Galaxy-S26-leak" alt="leaked spec sheet of the Galaxy S26 lineup on Facebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FqdqJvJeQ2rb3URhSG7ZgY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="512" height="640" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tech Informer / Facebook)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="zoom-upgrade-mystery-2">Zoom upgrade mystery</h2><p>There’s also some confusion about the cameras. Earlier leaks said the base and Plus models would keep the 10MP 3x telephoto lens from the S25, but this new leak lists a 12MP 3x telephoto camera instead.</p><p>Is it a simple typo, or is Samsung finally upgrading the zoom hardware on its non-Ultra phones? Given that the 10MP sensor has been around for generations, a bump to 12MP would be long overdue.</p><p>The charging speeds on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phones</a> have felt stagnant for years. The base S26 is reportedly stuck at 25W, but the Ultra is getting a much-needed boost. The leaked image corroborates rumors of 60W wired charging for the S26 Ultra, jumping up from the 45W cap we’ve seen previously.</p><p>With a 5,000mAh cell and the efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 (or Exynos 2600, depending on where you live), Ultra users might finally stop worrying about battery life.</p><p>If this new leak is accurate, the Galaxy S26 Plus could be a surprise hit in 2026, giving users an Ultra-sized experience without the Ultra price. Still, the differences in camera specs and screen size mean we should wait for official details before getting too excited.</p><p>We expect Samsung to clear up the confusion at Unpacked early next year. Until then, keep your chargers handy, though hopefully, you won't need them as often.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And while Samsung has been making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> for over seven years now, the company appears to already be working on a new form factor that would directly compete with the foldable iPhone.</p><p>According to previous reports, Apple is taking a different approach with its foldable iPhone. While most foldable phones today are taller than they are wide, Apple's foldable iPhone is expected to feature a wider design, closer to a passport or book-like form factor. This would reportedly deliver a more tablet-like experience with a 4:3 aspect ratio that is easier to hold and better suited for video and content consumption.</p><p>Now, according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20251219000227">ET News</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/jukan05/status/2002734601735962945">@jukan05 on X</a>), Samsung has also started working on a Wide Fold with a wider form factor than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to counter Apple's foldable iPhone.</p><p>The report claims Samsung's Wide Fold will feature a 7.6-inch inner OLED display, nearly matching Apple's rumored 7.58-inch inner screen size.</p><h2 id="samsung-may-be-copying-apple-s-foldable-homework-2">Samsung may be copying Apple's foldable homework</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="CADi6sXzFaP6wVqNGAvNjb" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-screens-open.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 side-by-side with screens open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CADi6sXzFaP6wVqNGAvNjb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The inner foldable display is said to use a 4:3 aspect ratio, but the biggest difference will be the outer screen. It is expected to be a 5.4-inch panel that is wider than it is tall, unlike the tall 6.5-inch outer display on the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/color-me-shocked-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-is-an-absolute-beast-for-gaming">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><p>This is not something entirely new. In fact, both Oppo with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n2-review">Find N2</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everyone-was-wrong-about-the-og-pixel-fold">original Google Pixel Fold</a> used a similar form factor. It is not yet clear why both Apple and Samsung are moving in this direction, but the report suggests it offers a greater sense of stability for users.</p><p>Additionally, the report says Samsung plans to launch the Wide Fold "in the fall." The device will reportedly become another addition to Samsung's Galaxy Z-series lineup. This would mean Samsung could release three foldable phones in 2026, with the Wide Fold joining the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-seems-poised-to-bring-its-exynos-2600-to-the-galaxy-z-flip-8-per-reports">Galaxy Z Flip 8</a> and Galaxy Z Fold 8.</p><p>The report also adds that the Galaxy Z Fold 8 is expected to retain the same screen size and aspect ratio as the Galaxy Fold 7, so no major changes, in terms of design, are expected with that particular model.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Garmin beat Apple, Samsung, and others ... but here we are, two years later. Is Garmin still on top? I decided to run a more thorough test, with more brands and newer models, to find out.</p><p>Companies don't advertise step-count upgrades, but Google tried to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-wear-os-5-1-step-count-algorithm-accuracy-pixel-watch-3">improve its step-count algorithm</a>, then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/second-april-wear-os-5-1-update-resolves-bad-step-algorithm-issues">rolled it back</a> when it inflated step counts. I assume other fitness brands regularly change their step calculations as well; watches that did poorly two years ago might have improved, while the better models might have regressed.</p><p>To see if Garmin is still the step-count king, I charged 10 of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness watches</a> I own — one each from Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Google, OnePlus, Amazfit, COROS, Polar, Suunto, and Withings — and jammed them onto my skinny runner arms for two 5,000-step walking tests and one 5,000-step jogging test. As a control group, I manually logged steps on a counting app.</p><p>Since I couldn't fit more than five watches on my arms simultaneously, that meant 30,000 steps in one tiring day. But it gave me some fascinating data! These are the most (and least) reliable fitness watches for hitting your daily 10,000 steps.</p><h2 id="tests-1-2-step-count-while-walking-2">Tests 1 & 2: Step count while walking</h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Fitness watch model</p></th><th  ><p>Test 1 (5,000 actual steps)</p></th><th  ><p>Test 2 (5,000 actual steps)</p></th><th  ><p>Total difference from actual steps</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Amazfit Active 2</p></td><td  ><p>4,863 <strong>(-137)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4,936 <strong>(+64)</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>201 (#6)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Apple Watch Ultra 2</p></td><td  ><p>4,998 <strong>(-2)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5,014 <strong>(+14)</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>16 (#1)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>COROS APEX 4</p></td><td  ><p>5,077 <strong>(+77)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5,019 <strong>(+19)</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>96 (#5)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Garmin Forerunner 970</p></td><td  ><p>5,053 <strong>(+53)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4,993<strong> (-7)</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>60 (#3)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel Watch 4</p></td><td  ><p>4,980 <strong>(-20)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td><td  ><p><strong>N/A</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OnePlus Watch 2R</p></td><td  ><p>4,978 <strong>(-22)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5,037 <strong>(+37)</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>59 (#2)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Polar Vantage V3</p></td><td  ><p>4,967 <strong>(-33)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5,060 <strong>(+60)</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>93 (#4)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</p></td><td  ><p>4,749 <strong>(-251)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4,953 <strong>(-47)</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>298 (#8)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Suunto Race 2</p></td><td  ><p>3,081 <strong>(-1,919)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>3,191 <strong>(1,809)</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>3,728 (#10)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Withings ScanWatch 2</p></td><td  ><p>4,830 <strong>(-170)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4,908 <strong>(-92)</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>262 (#7)</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> undeniably had the most consistent and reliable results; its "high dynamic range gyroscope" lives up to the fancy name, whereas the old Series 7 I used in 2023 had more pedestrian results.</p><p>Otherwise, any watch that's within 100 steps after 10,000 is still quite good by my measure, which puts the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Garmin Forerunner 970</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Polar Vantage V3</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-4-fitness-test-and-first-impressions">COROS APEX 4</a> in a reliable tier.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="8yiHGR5i4piw5LQxnWxMHM" name="10,000-step-test-apple-watch-ultra-2-amazfit-active-2-oneplus-watch-2r" alt="A photo of the Amazfit Active 2, OnePlus Watch 2R, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 all strapped onto one arm." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8yiHGR5i4piw5LQxnWxMHM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The COROS APEX 4, while not perfect, did much better than the APEX 2 Pro in my 2023 test.

I gave the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a> a glowing review and have continued to enjoy using it months later. Both my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-battery-test">battery test</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-fitness-test">fitness test</a> showed significant improvements over the last generation. Wear OS 6 impressed me with its overhauled UI, and the new Fitbit app is promising — though that's more of a 2026 development.</p><p>While the main hardware launch gets an "<strong>A</strong>," I have to knock Google for a few other developments. First, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/googles-first-pixel-watch-gets-its-final-update-ending-official-support">Pixel Watch 1 didn't get Wear OS 6</a>, confirming that Galaxy Watches get at least one extra version update than Google's, if not two. This lessens Pixel Watches' long-term value.</p><p>The messy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-1-seems-to-have-come-with-multiple-bugs">Wear OS 5.1 update in March</a> proved that Google had some QC work to do, though later updates have been pain-free. My bigger complaint is about Google's Wear OS stewardship: Mobvoi fleeing the platform in 2025, after Fossil left in 2024, suggests the "open" platform isn't profitable enough for smaller, non-Android brands anymore.</p><p>We don't have Pixel Watch 4 sales numbers, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/pr/2025/sep/global-wearable-band-market-to-grow-9percent-as-smartwatches-and-health-tech-surge">Omdia</a>'s chart shows how Google's wearable profits since 2022 have peaked in every fourth quarter, and we can assume the Watch 4 will hit a new high, given its excellent hardware and positive user reviews thus far.</p><h2 id="samsung-in-2025-b-2">Samsung in 2025: B</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="owttN5qAUWQSMxnLyoQYWG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-8" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/owttN5qAUWQSMxnLyoQYWG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is consistently one of the top smartwatch brands worldwide, but its sales <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-smartwatch-global-drop-q1-2025-shipments">dipped dramatically in Q1 2025</a> and haven't fully recovered. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/pr/2025/dec/global-wearable-band-shipments-up-3percent-setting-stage-for-strong-holiday-season">Omnia</a> shows Samsung wearable sales climbed this fall, but Samsung still lost 2% market share, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/reports/smartwatch-shipment-forecast-by-brand-region-2025-november-update" target="_blank">Counterpoint</a> tracked a 5% market drop for Samsung smartwatches in the last quarter.</p><p>You can blame a few factors, like a lackluster Galaxy Watch 7 generation or Huawei stealing Samsung's international market share. It makes sense that Samsung took a big swing with the Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic designs, trying to recapture consumer interest, and reversing its falling trends might be a long-term project.</p><p>My colleague Brady loves how skinny and light his Watch 8 is, and says people shouldn't dismiss the squircle design as ugly until they see it in person. I also like my Classic's rotating bezel and scale border, but I'm more lukewarm on its bulky weight and smaller display. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Ultra (2025)</a> is barely worth mentioning, with the cheaper models stealing the Ultra's look, third button, and brighter display.</p><p>I appreciate Samsung's dogged determination to track as many health metrics as possible. On the fitness side, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-running-coach-galaxy-watch-8-is-cool-idea-held-back-by-hardware-and-execution">Running Coach</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-announces-ifit-partnership-with-galaxy-watch-integration-and-six-month-demo">new iFit video workouts</a> won't wow anyone.</p><p>I'm more enthusiastic about Samsung's spin-off of Wear OS 6, One UI 8 Watch, which offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-galaxy-watch-8-tiles-are-best-part-of-one-ui-8-watch" target="_blank">excellent Tiles</a> and the useful Now Bar alongside new watch faces and an efficiency boost.

Things started out strong with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>: Its battery life is unprecedented for a true smartwatch, it fixed several flaws in the last model (such as adding a functional crown), and it has a classy titanium look.</p><p>Yes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-pushes-open-sale-of-watch-3-after-meda-error">"Meda in China" typo</a> delayed its launch into April, but that was a nothingburger. And OnePlus followed up by launching a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-43mm-hands-on">Watch 3 43mm</a> in July, and while the signature battery life has shrunk, it still lasts two days, the same as the Pixel Watch 4 45mm.</p><p>The bigger issue concerns the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">Watch 2R</a>. OnePlus Watches are due to receive two OS updates, but these 2024 models are still stuck on Wear OS 4 — two versions behind the competition — delayed from OnePlus's promised Q3 2025 update window for Wear OS 5. I thought OnePlus would be better than Fossil and Mobvoi at promptly updating its watches, and I'm <em>concerned</em> that history is repeating itself.</p><p>Then we ended the year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-lite-announced-with-oppo-watch-s-design">OnePlus Watch Lite</a>, which I hoped would be a cheap Wear OS watch; instead, it'll use a proprietary OS, similar to the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-watch-review">OnePlus Watch</a>. This doesn't guarantee that OnePlus will abandon Wear OS for good, but it does feel like another warning sign.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It makes models like the $300 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">COROS Pace Pro</a> feel like a great value, because you get tools like offline maps and Strava Live Segments that only $600+ Garmin watches have.</p><p>It's no coincidence that COROS is the "fastest-growing watch brand year-over-year on Strava" in the app's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://contentful-assets.strava.com/Strava-Year-In-Sport-Trend-Report-2025-US.pdf">2025 end-of-year report</a>.

While our tester praised how "incredibly soft" it feels to wear, he's also noticed areas where the finish has been "scratched off" from wear and tear, and that the new finish makes it "noticeably thicker and a bit heavier" than the normal Ring 4.</p><p>Overall, Oura kept users happy with new features, made record-breaking profits, and weaponized patents to scuttle its biggest rival (Ultrahuman) and demand royalties from the rest.

If you're a TikTok user in the U.S. wondering what this means for the social app, you're in the right place.</p><p>The deal was announced internally by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/tiktok">TikTok</a> CEO Shou Chew in a memo obtained by multiple news outlets. The TikTok leader reportedly said there is "more work to be done" ahead of the closing date, although the preliminary deal has been signed. The new joint venture would pass partial ownership of TikTok's U.S. business to Oracle Corporation, Silver Lake, and MGX.</p><p>The new TikTok venture would see Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX hold 15% of the new company, with ByteDance keeping 19.9% ownership. Another 30.1% will reportedly be owned by affiliates of current ByteDance investors. The terms of the deal are said to create a seven-member board of directors for the new TikTok joint venture, with majority-American members.</p><p>Chew explained the terms of the deal in the reported memo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/deal-tiktok-us-investors-means-users/story?id=128551312" target="_blank">ABC News</a>):</p><div><blockquote><p>Pursuant to the Executive Order signed by U.S. President Donald J. Trump on September 25, 2025, the agreements specify that the U.S. joint venture will be majority owned by American investors, governed by a new seven-member majority-American board of directors, and subject to terms that protect Americans' data and U.S. national security.</p><p>TikTok CEO Shou Chew</p></blockquote></div><p>The new deal is the culmination of a lengthy process that included a congressional bill outlining the terms of the required sale of TikTok's U.S. business. If a deal was not reached, the law mandated a nationwide ban. However, the bill also gave U.S. President Donald Trump the power to guide and approve the terms of a sale. TikTok was briefly banned in the U.S., but Trump also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-avoids-a-us-ban-for-a-second-time-thanks-to-trumps-75-day-reprieve">signed multiple executive orders extending the sale-or-ban deadline</a>.</p><p>Now that a deal has been signed, here's what we know about how it will affect users.</p><h2 id="what-s-changing-for-tiktok-users-2">What's changing for TikTok users</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iYp25mxcTDbEQWRud7ondm" name="tiktok-download-no-iphone-tiktok-logo" alt="Demonstrating the many ways to download TikTok on an Android phone while an iPhone sits face down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iYp25mxcTDbEQWRud7ondm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the U.S. government's concerns with TikTok is how the platform's algorithm could be used to influence the public. TikTok is currently owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. As part of the sale, the joint venture will reportedly control the TikTok algorithm, quelling those concerns.</p><p>The new company will retrain "the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation," according to Chew's memo. Additionally, the joint venture will have "ultimate decision-making authority for reviewing and approving all content moderation and related policies within the United States."</p><p>In other words, if you're in the U.S., your TikTok feed may start to look different early next year — if the deal closes as expected.</p><p>The deal also mandates the storing of U.S. user data in a "trusted and secure cloud environment in the United States run by Oracle," according to the memo.</p><h2 id="what-comes-next-for-the-planned-tiktok-sale-2">What comes next for the planned TikTok sale</h2><p>The closing date for TikTok's sale is set to arrive next month, but in order for that to happen, a few questions will need to be answered.</p><p>Most importantly, experts say that China could block the deal from closing. In the past, U.S. President Trump said that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal, but this has not been officially confirmed by the Chinese government. Additionally, it remains to be seen whether the signed deal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-bill-to-ban-tiktok-signed-into-law">meets the conditions of the congressional bill banning TikTok</a>.</p><p>If everything moves forward as expected, TikTok users in the U.S. could start seeing a different algorithm next month.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/its-official-samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-launch">launched the Galaxy Z Trifold</a> on December 1, which is said to bring the power of "the most advanced foldable technologies" right into the palm of your hands.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TX8uHpF57iqEJFViw5CgEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Essentially, making the form factor more valid and widely available to the broader smartphone market. When Samsung launches a new device, the entire ecosystem follows, from Google optimizing Android for it to carriers that might be willing to subsidize it for consumers. This also means developers will start creating apps compatible with multi-window support on a larger scale. But it doesn't just end there.</p><p>Samsung's aim wasn't about adding another screen, but to experiment with whether a trifold could actually be a usable product. While it may not replace traditional slab phones anytime soon, it could double as a tablet and a productivity tool. This kind of shift in thought from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/poll-would-you-buy-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold">"Why would you want this?" to "Who is this actually made for?"</a> is a huge deal.

This included the affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Razr 2025</a> and the premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>, which ended up being my favorite [flip] phone of 2025.</p><p>Motorola also seems to have found its stride in design. It heightened its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">focus on CMF (Colors, Materials, and Finish) across its lineup</a> through its partnership with Pantone, offering vegan leather, Alcantara, and even wood on its phones, harkening back to the days of Moto Maker.</p><p>We even got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-edge-70-is-taking-a-shot-at-apple-and-samsung-with-a-massive-battery">a thin phone</a> to compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a>, proving that Motorola isn’t going to sit by and let Samsung and Apple have all the fun.</p><p>If anything, this has all improved Motorola’s reputation, transforming it from just a budget Android phone maker to one that can hang with the best of them.</p><h2 id="two-steps-forward-one-step-back-2">Two steps forward, one step back</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YViWyiguZSXDRNZmMBHRuj" name="motorola-edge-2025-green-looking-in-disbelief" alt="Looking in disbelief at a Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YViWyiguZSXDRNZmMBHRuj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite its impressive flagship and even midrange hardware like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-review">Moto G Stylus 2025</a>, there was a notable hole in its lineup: a flagship option for consumers who don’t want a foldable phone. Last year, I had hoped that Motorola would finally challenge the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung's Ultra phone</a> in 2025 with a follow-up to the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Edge Plus 2023</a>, but alas, we never got it.</p><p>We also got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-buds-loop-watch-fit-spotlight-details-launch">a new smartwatch</a>, but still no Wear OS or a true Moto 360 revival. That felt odd at a time when Android OEMs like OnePlus are proving they can make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">compelling devices</a> to strengthen their device ecosystems, something Motorola truly needs. Motorola introduced new tablets and its first laptop, but unfortunately, neither came to the U.S.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3843px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="SYyyUusGWkubo8cGCFbvcP" name="Moto-Watch-Fit-hands-on" alt="The Moto Watch Fit menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SYyyUusGWkubo8cGCFbvcP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3843" height="2162" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the software front, Motorola didn't move the needle very much. Hello UX is largely unoffensive, and there are some clever uses of AI like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/first-things-to-do-with-the-motorola-razr-2025-series">Look & Talk</a> and the ability to choose from a wide selection of AI models like Perplexity. However, the overall software/AI package still feels less mature and cohesive than Samsung’s One UI, and I often end up ignoring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> in favor of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>.</p><p>Motorola also continues to trail its rivals in software updates, offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-software-update-support">one of the shortest update promises for flagship phones</a> and less consistently than others. This ultimately reduces the overall value of its phones, since they'll lose support sooner than those of Samsung, OnePlus, or Pixel.</p><p>Ultimately, Motorola still lacks compelling software differentiators. While its camera software and algorithms have improved, there's little reason to buy a Razr over a Pixel or Samsung phone if you want great photos.</p><h2 id="motorola-is-getting-comfortable-2">Motorola is getting comfortable</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>… but hopefully not too comfortable.

And aside from some genuinely useful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a> features, there isn’t anything to tether us to its products.</p><h2 id="oneplus-b-2">OnePlus: B+</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2455px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BqzGoXiKPCZEGmGKJmtdoX" name="oneplus12r-logo-render.png" alt="OnePlus 12R logo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BqzGoXiKPCZEGmGKJmtdoX.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2455" height="1381" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's been an interesting year for OnePlus.

That, alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, showcased OnePlus's commitment to the higher-end segment, which should help increase its Total Addressable Market beyond the $300-$600 segment.</p><p>OnePlus furthered this with the launch of its second flagship in one year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a>, which boasts the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> and offsets the power-hungry chip with a massive 7,300mAh battery.

It’s clear OnePlus was not going to let Samsung rule the Android tablet market unchecked.</p><p>This is all tied together by OnePlus' impressive software, from OxygenOS 15 to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-hands-on">OxygenOS 16</a>, both of which improved performance and introduced a host of AI features that feel well implemented.</p><h2 id="missed-opportunities-2">Missed opportunities</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GTr2YUbdcBZZuZSWjTnB7b" name="oneplus-15-unboxing-01" alt="Unboxing the OnePlus 15 with the included charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GTr2YUbdcBZZuZSWjTnB7b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, OnePlus continues to hinder itself in one of its biggest markets. The company has all but abandoned the mid-range market by increasing the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/no-limits-the-oneplus-15r-empowers-android-users-with-flagship-performance-huge-battery">OnePlus 15R</a> and ditching the Nord series in the U.S. The biggest problem with this strategy is that it limits the reach of its phones, especially given the already few avenues to buy them.</p><p>Last year, I noted how OnePlus was hurting itself by not making its devices available through carrier channels in the U.S. While this isn't as big a problem in other regions, carriers largely control the U.S. smartphone market, and not playing by their rules means fewer eyes on your phones. As it stands, the company's market share is negligible, and I feel like the OnePlus 13 and 15 could have been bigger hits.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XvocrkJ9NQrCe4fwFr3Pq4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvocrkJ9NQrCe4fwFr3Pq4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the lack of a foldable didn't go unnoticed. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a> was an impressively thin phone that gave us hope for an equally impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-oneplus-open-as-good-as-i-remember">OnePlus Open</a> successor. Unfortunately, OnePlus stayed out of the foldable race altogether.</p><p>On the one hand, it makes sense given OnePlus's lack of carrier presence to help offset the exorbitant foldable prices. However, the OnePlus Open was so well received that it felt odd not to see OnePlus tap its OPPO partnership to bring a new device to the U.S. to give Google and Samsung a proper challenge.</p><p>OnePlus has proven that it has the tools to create an amazing range of devices. I just wish it had showcased that more in 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's always a mix of fun, wishes, and actual expectations.</p><p>Usually, nobody circles back to see how these crystal ball predictions turned out. This is exactly what I'm going to do!</p><p>I made four big predictions last December about how the mobile tech market would move during 2025. I based these on a little bit of insider knowledge, some common sense, and current trends. Let's take a look at how things have fared.</p><h2 id="foldables-were-all-the-rage-in-2025-2">Foldables were all the rage in 2025</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oXYnF9FoswnR2ANM367cHQ" name="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z TriFold hands-on testing at Dubai Mall on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXYnF9FoswnR2ANM367cHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, I said that one of the biggest trends in 2025 may<em> </em>be the rise of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>.</p><p>"<em>Manufacturers are pushing the boundaries of smartphone design, offering devices that seamlessly transition between phone and tablet modes. These devices are becoming more affordable and reliable, making them a compelling option for consumers seeking a versatile mobile experience</em>."</p><p>And that's pretty much what happened. We not only saw "budget" foldables improve with offerings from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review" target="_blank">Motorola</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-review" target="_blank">Samsung</a>, but also the dawn of phones that fold twice; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/first-official-look-at-samsung-trifold-phone">tri-folding phones</a> are here and aren't going away.</p><p>One thing I expected but didn't see was a significant rise in popularity. The foldable market is sustainable, with companies selling enough products to continue designing, developing, and manufacturing them, but it didn't surge in a big way. With more models available, there are more of them in consumer hands, but you won't see as many people using them as I thought.</p><h2 id="the-year-of-ai-2">The year of AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="M2w3snBRHo5K8r5kvVos96" name="Gemini-3" alt="The Google Gemini 3 promotional image." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M2w3snBRHo5K8r5kvVos96.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, I said that "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini"><em>Artificial intelligence</em></a><em> (AI) is rapidly integrating into various aspects of mobile technology.

Tech like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5g-redcap-explained">RedCap</a> was promoted as a way to enhance your smartwatch, but if it did, we didn't notice.

Unfortunately, things went in the opposite direction.</p><p>Yes, Google is part of initiatives like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-carbon-capture-initiative-a-savior-or-a-smokescreen" target="_blank">carbon-emission schemes</a>, but the company is also wasting billions of gallons of water to power its AI data centers. Throw Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle (should I continue?) into the mix, and we're not trying to heal the planet; we're rapidly destroying it.</p><p>This can't continue. Burying carbon dioxide in canisters under Indiana isn't going to fix it, nor is buying carbon credits or recycling fishing nets. Tech giants have let their thirst for AI run amok, and soon, we'll pay the price.</p><p>If you're a tech enthusiast, 2025 turned out to be a very interesting year. It brought plenty of cool and innovative products like tri-folding phones or AI that comes closer to actually being intelligent. It might not have been everything I had imagined it would or give us that one thing we really wanted, but all in all, it was a pretty good year.</p><p>As long as you don't need clean water.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After several years of only minor camera changes in the Z Fold series, a new rumor suggests the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8">Galaxy Z Fold 8</a> will get two major sensor upgrades that could help it match Samsung’s top non-foldable phones.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-fold-8/" target="_blank">GalaxyClub</a>, Samsung will keep the 200MP main camera from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. Keeping this sensor shows confidence, but the real news is about the other cameras.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 8 is tipped to get a big upgrade to its ultrawide camera, moving from a 12MP sensor to a 50MP one. This higher resolution should mean clearer wide photos and more options for cropping.</p><p>Samsung is also saidto be upgrading the telephoto camera. The change from a 10MP to a 12MP sensor might seem small, but with the same 3x optical zoom, it should produce sharper zoomed images.</p><h2 id="selfies-stay-the-same-2">Selfies stay the same</h2><p>However, not all cameras could see upgrades. The report says the front-facing cameras will likely stay the same. This isn’t surprising, since Samsung tends to be careful with front camera changes, and it shows the company is focusing on the cameras people use most.</p><p>This shift highlights Samsung’s changing priorities. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Foldable phones</a> are now mainstream and expensive, so buyers expect them to match regular phones in camera quality.</p><p>None of this is official yet, and things could change before launch. Still, if Samsung follows its usual schedule and releases in 2026, the Galaxy Z Fold 8 could be the first Fold that doesn’t make buyers settle for less in photography.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, though, the rivalry between Xreal and Viture has shifted from product features to a legal battle.</p><p>Viture, known for its user-friendly AR glasses, now faces a potential sales freeze in several European markets after a German granted a temporary preliminary injunction based on rival Xreal patents. The Science and Technology Innovation Board Daily <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://api3.cls.cn/c/2234287" target="_blank">reports</a> that "the products involved in the lawsuit have lost their legal sales qualifications in the German market."

This patent, owned by Xreal, covers an augmented reality device and its optical system. It's important to note that this injunction is not a final ruling, nor is it confirmation of a patent breach.</p><p>The injunction states that Eden Future is temporarily barred from offering, marketing, importing, or selling the affected products in Germany. According to the source, the injunction may also affect Viture Pro, Luma, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vitures-new-luma-glasses-are-incredible-and-this-viture-prime-day-sale-is-impossible-to-resist">Luma Pro</a> in nine EU countries, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, and Belgium.

The patent being cited is newly issued and has not yet passed the opposition period. It is already covered by an earlier patent, and we have formally filed an opposition against it. The opposing party is attempting to exploit a procedural timing gap, and we have also filed an appeal in relation to the preliminary injunction.</em></p><p><em>At present, there is only a temporary preliminary injunction in Germany that relates solely to VITURE Pro. However, VITURE Pro has already sold out in Germany and remains listed in other European countries. The preliminary injunction does not apply to any other European markets. Furthermore, our product does not infringe upon the cited patent in any way.</em></p><p><em>All of our products remain fully available and online across Europe. No listings have been removed. We welcome verification of any listings at any time. VITURE will continue to firmly safeguard our legal rights and will actively challenge any unfair, misleading, or incorrect allegations. In addition, we have initiated legal action in China in response to the dissemination of false rumors. During this period, our products continue to perform strongly and maintain leading positions in multiple European markets.</em></p><p><em>We understand that their market position may be under pressure; however, we strongly oppose this act of unfair competition.
