<hr>
<p>Qualcomm is hosting its annual Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii and Chinese OEM Xiaomi announced important news concerning its next flagship.</p><p>During <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/0e5zpV0NS50">the keynote</a>, the SVP and president of Xiaomi, Adam Zeng, arrived on stage to discuss what consumers can expect in the future. The major highlight of Zeng's onstage presence was that the Xiaomi 15 series will feature Qualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. Zeng states the phones will be "the first" devices to rock the new chip "globally."</p><p>The company SVP added that the user experience "is the most important." Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite will be paired with Xiaomi's HyperCore. Zeng states this technology covers four areas: performance, graphics, networking, and security.</p><p>Together, Zeng says consumers grabbing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a> will experience "full-frame performance" during intensive games. Both HyperCore and the Snapdragon 8 Elite are said to drop the phone's power consumption by 29.7%. Moreover, the Xiaomi 15 series may stay cooler as peak internal temperatures are "three degrees lower" (Celsius) compared to Qualcomm's previous gen.</p><p>Lastly, Zeng announced that the Xiaomi 15 series will launch "at the end of October." Xiaomi's William Lu added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/content/dam/qcomm-martech/dm-assets/images/company/news-media/media-center/press-kits/snapdragon-summit-2024/day-1/documents/PartnerQuoteSheet.pdf">in separate statement</a> that the 8 Elite will usher in "a new era of on-device generative AI with the support of on-device multi-modal generative AI applications." </p><p>Other news from Xiaomi during the keynote touted its continued presence in the #3 spot of the top smartphone brands globally. What's more, the Chinese OEM reportedly accounts for 22.1% of "total shipments" in 2024.</p>

<p>Qualcomm announced its newest SoC, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">the Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> during its Summit 2024 event in Maui. The chip is built off the 3nm, TSMC process with two prime cores, clocking out at 4.32GHz prime cores. The chip's internal structure continues with six 3.53GHz performance cores and 5.3Gbps LPDDR5X memory.</p><p>Qualcomm states the Snapdragon 8 Elite reaches a 45% boost in single and multi-core performance over its predecessor. Additionally, the chip should deliver a 44% increase in phone efficiency. AI was the name of the game for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">the SD 8 Gen 3</a> and that continues today. With 45% "better performance per watt," the 8 Elite should fall seamlessly in line with Google's Gemini for snappy on-device usage.</p>

The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7, our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatch</a> that money can buy today, just scored a whopping 18% discount at Amazon, knocking the price down to its lowest point EVER. No fine print, no strings attached — just good old-fashioned savings. </p><p>We&apos;ll have to hold off for a few more weeks to see most of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">Black Friday discounts</a> go live, but in the meantime, this deal is quite the treat. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> is our favorite smartwatch on the market right now, not because it's the most powerful, but because it balances innovative features and premium specs with a price tag that's accessible for most folks. Buy the 40mm watch from Amazon today and you'll get even more bang for your buck, as the retailer is currently carving a historic 18% off for a limited time.</p>
<p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-watch7-aluminum-smartwatch-40mm-bt-cream/6585114.p">Best Buy - $259.99</a> | <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Galaxy-Watch7-40mm-Cream-Bluetooth/6214656451">Walmart - $244.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1YNVD88" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="301bfea2-0edc-4feb-9b6f-ec6e2d07abf2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299.99" data-dimension48="$299.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>If you&apos;re familiar with past <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Samsung watches</a>, you&apos;ll notice that the Galaxy Watch 7 is more about careful refinement than reinventing the wheel. While the Watch 7 retains the vibrant, scratch-resistant AMOLED display, most of the watch&apos;s upgrades can be found under the hood. You get a snappy Exynos processer for smooth app performance, plus 40 hours of battery life, 13 heart rate LEDs for super-accurate monitoring, and a ton of new Galaxy AI software features. There&apos;s also 32GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, and the four years of guaranteed OS updates means you could be using this watch through 2028 before it starts to feel even remotely dated. </p><p>Like we already mentioned, the Galaxy Watch 7 doesn&apos;t look that different from its predecessor, so it probably won&apos;t be particularly impressive in the style department (although using replacement <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">Galaxy Watch 7 bands</a> can help). We were also disappointed to see that Samsung got rid of the Wireless Power Share feature that let you juice up your smartwatch using another device. </p><p>In the grand scheme of things, these flaws are pretty minor, so if you were hoping to find a great smartwatch at a discount before the holiday madness begins, don&apos;t let this early Black Friday deal from Amazon pass you by. </p>

<hr>
<p>Honor is set to unveil the Magic 7 series in China on October 30, but it isn&apos;t waiting until then to showcase the phone&apos;s AI features. The Chinese manufacturer took to the stage at Qualcomm&apos;s annual summit in Hawaii to announce Autopilot AI, and on-device AI agent that can be used to automate mundane tasks.</p><p>Honor says the on-device AI can assist with "travel planning, ticket booking, calendar scheduling, notification management, cross-app file transfer," and it also has the ability to get rid of unwanted subscriptions. It sounds similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">Large Action Model (LAM)</a> Motorola showed off at Lenovo Tech World 2024, but that was just a proof of concept, and Honor&apos;s Autopilot AI will actually be available on the company&apos;s next flagship series. All of that sounds great, but I&apos;ll wait until I get my hands on the Magic 7 to see how it actually holds up in real-world testing.</p><p>It&apos;s clear that Honor wants AI to be a key talking point on its phones; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-magicos-80-with-android-14-and-a-generous-serving-of-ai">MagicOS 8.0</a> introduced the Magic Portal last year, delivering intent-based AI use cases. While its usability was limited, Honor teamed up with Google to bring a slate of new features to its devices later in the year, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-hands-on">Magic V3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-battery-life">Magic 6 Pro</a> continue to be great in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1913px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.39%;"><img id="owr5Ew97kcwvHsEStSziN7" name="magic-7-2.jpg" alt="Honor's Magic 7 on-device AI showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/owr5Ew97kcwvHsEStSziN7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1913" height="964" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The on-device AI agent will debut in MagicOS 9.0, which is what the Magic 7 series will run out of the box. In addition to an AI assistant, Honor is bringing generative AI to gaming, noting that its on-device AI rendering engine will reduce the load on the GPU, delivering better image fidelity and thermals.</p><p>With Qualcomm highlighting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> at its summit, Honor becomes one of the first brands to confirm the use of the next-gen platform on its devices. With the Magic 7 series set to debut on October 30, we don&apos;t have to wait too long to know more about what these devices bring to the table.</p>

<p>Google's latest flagship has been out for several months now, and with the Black Friday sales approaching, many folks are on the hunt for the best Pixel 9 deals. Whether you want the base model Pixel 9 or the beastly Pixel 9 Pro XL, you've come to the right place: I built this guide so you know exactly where to look when the Black Friday sales go live.</p><p>There aren't too many deals available just yet, but I expect that to change dramatically in the coming weeks. If you're looking for more than just a new smartphone this holiday season, I also recommend taking a look at our guide to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2024-early-discounts-and-how-to-prepare">best Black Friday Pixel deals</a>, where I share more discounts on smartwatches, tablets, and more. Now enough chatter, let's get on with the deals.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-deals"><span>Google Pixel 9 deals</span></h3>
<p>The base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> starts at $799 for the 128GB version and $899 for the 256GB phone. Both configurations boast 12GB of RAM straight out of the box, plus you'll enjoy the efficiency of the new Tensor G4 chipset alongside an improved 4,700mAh battery and loads of AI-powered software features. </p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-pro-deals"><span>Google Pixel 9 Pro deals</span></h3>
<p>For the first time ever, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> is the same size as the base model Google Pixel 9 — but fear not, things still look quite different under the hood. The Google Pixel 9 Pro boasts the Tensor G4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, plus you get an improved 42 MP front camera system and a telephoto lens (another first for Google devices). The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 for the 128GB version, and there's also a more-expensive 1TB version if you need additional storage.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-deals"><span>Google Pixel 9 Pro XL deals</span></h3>
<p>Probably the most surprising smartphone announced during Made by Google 2024, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL picks up where Google left off with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-xl-review">Pixel 4 XL</a> years ago. It's essentially a bigger version of the Pixel 9 Pro, with a 6.8-inch LTPO display, 16GB of RAM, and a slightly larger battery. The XL phone starts at $1,099 for the 128GB version, or you could go up to 1TB to get more storage.</p>

<ul><li>Google is pushing an update to Workspace customers that includes Gemini-backed summaries for unread conversations.</li><li>A "summarize" button will appear when hovering over conversations and interacting with it produces a bulleted list of "important" information.</li><li>Earlier in October, Google Chat picked up video messaging, an extension of its earlier voice messages update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an update for its Chat app that&apos;ll tell you everything you need to know <em>before </em>opening a thread.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/10/gemini-summaries-google-chat.html">Workspace post</a>, Google highlighted the beginning of its "Gemini in Chat" update that brings AI-backed summaries to busy conversations. The company states users will soon find a bulleted list of "important" points from an unread chat thread in the app. Google states the feature may help users "focus" and find what&apos;s important before tackling other tasks.</p><p>Users opening Chat&apos;s "Home" page on the web will find Gemini&apos;s typical starry "summarize" button when hovering over an unread conversation. Clicking it will expand the single line like a drop-down menu. From there, users will see a "Summary" banner with the key points Gemini feels are important. Google states this is intended to be a "synopsis" of the conversation.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini&apos;s</a> chat summaries are rolling out for mobile users, too. However, to surface them, users on mobile must long-press an unread chat thread. Gemini&apos;s summaries will appear automatically above the app&apos;s typical list of thread options.</p><p>Of course, Google includes its typical AI tagline that it could "get things wrong." Users may want to hop in and check things out just to be safe. Additionally, the post states users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10079371">can turn this off</a> if they don&apos;t want Gemini going through for synopsis purposes.</p><p>The update is rolling out for web, Android, and iOS users today (Oct 21) on rapid and scheduled release domains. Google Workspace customers with the following add-ons are eligible: Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, Education Premium, and AI & Messaging.</p>

<p>Google&apos;s been upgrading Chat throughout 2024, with its most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-gets-video-messages-feature">hitting users earlier in October</a>. The update brought video messaging similar to what you&apos;d experience in WhatsApp. Google gives users a way to record three-minute-long videos in the Chat app. These video messages can be sent in direct messages (one-on-one), group DMs, and spaces.</p><p>What&apos;s more, this update is essentially an add-on to Google&apos;s earlier update from March <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-voice-messages-mobile-rollout">added voice messages to Chat</a>. Users can tap the microphone icon to begin recording their voice instead of typing a text in a DM or group DM. Unfortunately, voice messages are restricted to Enterprise customers.</p>

<ul><li>The latest beta version of WhatsApp has a new Chat memory feature for Meta AI.</li><li>It allows the chatbot to save users' preferences and personal details in order to give users a more personalized response.</li><li>The feature is seen testing in beta and is likely to debut soon in future updates.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Meta AI integration is widely popular as Meta owns quite a few notable apps, such as Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, that integrate its chatbot. With WhatsApp, it looks like a new feature for Meta AI is in development, which has been spotted in the latest beta version of the app.</p><p>According to folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-24-22-9-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>, the WhatsApp beta for Android (version <strong>2.24.22.9</strong>, appears to have a new feature under development that adds Chat memory for Meta AI. The new feature aims to make the chatbot's experience more personalized.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:772px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:77.72%;"><img id="pBBrT6TbCjP2hAAbM5SDAb" name="whatsapp-meta-ai-chatbot-new-feature.jpg" alt="Chat memory for Meta AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pBBrT6TbCjP2hAAbM5SDAb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="772" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WABetaInfo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In what appears to be a future update, Meta AI will be able to automatically remember some details shared with the chatbot. Utilizing the chat memory, users can get more relevant and customized responses when chatting with Meta AI. </p><p>Users can access this setting by opening the Meta AI chat, tapping the profile at the top, and tapping the new "Memory" tab right under the Notifications and Media visibility sections. WABetaInfo further notes that Meta AI can retain many users' details, such as their diet preferences, birthdays, allergies, books, and what kind of podcasts they like.</p>
<p>The chatbot's responses after the update will be based on the details stored in the Meta AI. Despite storing all such data, users are believed to have full control over the data they choose to share with the chatbot. This data can also be deleted at any time, which users need to be aware of whenever they want to share their personal preferences. </p><p>Having a more personal chatbot based on your interests could make Meta AI more useful than getting more generic responses. The latest feature is currently in the works since it is in beta and can be downloaded through the Google Play Beta Program. General users will be able to see the update once the rollout begins, which should likely be sooner rather than later.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors state the Pixel 9a's dimensions could arrive as: 154.7 x 73.2 x 8.9mm.</li><li>Speculation states the Pixel 9a's display could rise from the Pixel 8a's 6.1-inch display to 6.2 or 6.3 inches.</li><li>A host of alleged Pixel 9a renders surfaced recently, suggesting the phone could forgo an iconic aspect of the Pixel lineup.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new leak claims to have narrowed down the dimensions of the upcoming budget Pixel from Google.</p><p>The leaks stem from known X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks/status/1847298428906127770">OnLeaks</a>, who states they&apos;ve received "updated data" about the Pixel 9a&apos;s dimensions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/10/google-pixel-9a-dimensions.html">Android Headlines</a>). According to the rumors, the next A-series Pixel could sport the following measurements: 154.7 x 73.2 x 8.9mm. The tipster adds that the final measurement rises to "9.4mm" when the rear camera housing is accounted for.</p><p>These measurements suggest a slightly higher (taller) and wider device than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a&apos;s</a> 152.1 x 72.7 x 8.9mm measurements.</p><p>Rumors about the device&apos;s display remain relatively uncertain. However, the publication theorizes that the slight changes in the Pixel 9a&apos;s dimensions could produce a small display increase. The publication speculates the Pixel 9a could greet users with a 6.2 to 6.3-inch display, which would put it up against the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 9</a>. </p><p>Moreover, as the publication adds, the A-series Pixel often boasts larger bezels than the flagship line. With that in mind, this slight dimension change may not matter much. The Pixel 9a could end up featuring <em>even more </em>noticeable bezels than we may want.</p><p>This is speculation at this point, so take this in with caution.</p>

<p>There&apos;s still some time before a Pixel 9a reveal, but that&apos;s not stopping a slew of renderings from surfacing. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/supposed-pixel-9a-render-camera-bump-change">alleged imagery</a> suggests the Pixel 9a will mirror the flagship Pixel 9 series&apos; design but with one major change: a lack of a camera visor. Rumors claim the phone will drop the massive camera bump in favor of an array flush to the rear panel.</p><p>Google stood by its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">large and proud camera bump</a> on the Pixel 9 in August. However, the company cited consumer interest in photography as the catalyst for the bump. Google&apos;s Director of Design for Pixel phones, Claude Zellweger said that an interest in wanting sharper, clearer photos requires beefier sensors and lenses — thus the big bump.</p><p>How this rumored change affects the Pixel 9a&apos;s camera performance remains to be seen.</p><p>In other news, the Pixel 9a is rumored to grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9a-modem-tensor-g4-rumored-changes">strange Tensor G4 change</a>.

We&apos;ve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-7a-tensor-g2-alleged-packaging">seen this happen</a> with the Pixel 7a, so it seems history is repeating itself.</p><p>The Pixel 9a is rumored to debut in Q2 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon 8 Elite, a 3nm TSMC-made SoC, at its annual summit on Monday.</li><li>It has two 4.32GHz prime cores and six 3.53GHz performance cores, along with 5.3Gbps LPDDR5X memory.</li><li>Qualcomm promises its new Oryon CPU offers a 45% single- and multi-core performance boost with a 44% efficiency boost over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3.</li><li>Its GPU and NPU performance have also improved by 40% and 45%, respectively.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If you find Qualcomm's naming scheme for its chips confusing, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is named to make things obvious: This is its fastest system-on-a-chip (SoC) yet, built to make flagship Android phones more powerful than ever.</p><p>Announced at the Qualcomm Summit 2024 in Maui, the Snapdragon 8 Elite is the first to use a custom Oryon CPU instead of the usual ARM Cortex cores. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, it won't have any low-clocked efficiency chips, either: its six performance cores hit 3.53GHz, which is faster than the 3.3GHz Cortex-X4 found in the last-gen SoC. And its two prime cores will hit a blazing 4.32GHz.</p><p>As you'd expect, this leads to a 45% boost in single- and multi-core performance over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it's 44% more efficient at hitting the same top benchmarks. We'll have to see how the Snapdragon 8 Elite does for low-power efficiency, but Qualcomm implied during a media session that its performance cores would have no trouble on that front.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg" name="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-8-Elite-clock-speeds-memory" alt="A graphic showing the Snapdragon 8 Elite's 2 power cores (4.32GHz) and six performance cores (3.53GHz), plus the SoC's cache (24MB L2) and memory (5.3GHz LPDDR5x)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2QamvjFt5wCjPRjWr5hbkg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Qualcomm emphasizes the Snapdragon 8 Elite's AI boosts over the last generation as well: a 45% faster NPU and 45% better performance per watt. It'll enable popular LMMs like Llama and Gemini to integrate "directly" onto phones for speedy multi-modal AI generation.</p>

<p>Qualcomm promises that these AI enhancements will help specifically for better 5G connectivity. The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x80-mwc-2024">Snapdragon X80</a> pairs with the AI Suite Gen 3 that's meant to improve power handling, coverage, latency, QoS, mmWave beam management, and GNSS location, with a specific 30% location accuracy boost "even in parking structures."</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite jumps to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/now-available-new-version-of-the-bluetooth-core-specification/">Bluetooth 6.0</a>, which was only announced this September and offers some key upgrades to security and "distance awareness." And it directly integrates Ultra Wideband for precision finding and digital key tech.</p><p>Qualcomm didn't specify which Adreno GPU will be in the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but it did promise a 40% performance speed boost, 40% power savings, and 35% increased ray tracing performance. It has three GPU slices clocked at 1.1GHz and 12MB graphics memory.</p>

<p>As for other subtle changes, the Snapdragon 8 Elite supports QHD+ resolution up to 240Hz refresh rates, which could offer some incredibly smooth gaming experiences to go with the graphics boost. And we could begin to see 320MP camera sensors for the first time.</p><p>Even though everyone assumed the Snapdragon 8 Elite would be called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-4">Snapdragon 8 Gen 4</a>, Qualcomm decided to give it the same "Elite" moniker as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/qualcomm-is-betting-its-future-on-ai-and-google-could-benefit-the-most">Snapdragon X Elite</a> that it built for PCs.</p><p>Aside from saying it "deserves a new name" because of its custom CPU, Qualcomm wouldn't clarify whether future "Elite" SoCs would keep the "Gen X" label or if non-Elite Snapdragon flagship chips with Arm cores would continue, saying it wouldn't talk about its future roadmap.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, MediaTek revealed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400 SoC</a> with one 3.62GHz Cortex core, three 3.3GHz performance cores, and four 2.4GHz efficiency cores, all built on the same TSMC N3E process.</p><p>Compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-9300-launch">Dimensity 9300</a>, its performance gap—35% and 28% faster single- and multi-core performance with 40% better efficiency, plus 41% improved GPU power—isn't that far off from the gains Qualcomm got with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, even though the clock speeds have a significant gap.</p><p>MediaTek says the Dimensity 9400 hit 3,055/9,600 for a Geekbench 6.2 test or 2.8 million for AnTuTu. Qualcomm says the Snapdragon 8 Elite hits 3,222 / 10,444 on Geekbench 6.3 or 3 million for AnTuTu.</p><p>Qualcomm wins the benchmark battle, and it does so with its own Oryon cores instead of paying for Arm's. But you might be surprised that the gap isn't <em>wider</em>, given just how high the 8 Elite clock speed is. We'll have to get ahold of phones using both chips and see how they perform in the real world before we can judge for certain.</p>

How in the world could Meta possibly deliver a headset that's $200 cheaper without sacrificing the Quest 3's power, color mixed reality vision, new controllers with advanced haptic feedback, and all the improvements to the Quest ecosystem that have happened over the next year?</p><p>Somehow, they've done it. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> is a triumph in nearly every way, from its highly polished onboarding presentation to the excellent mixed reality content that's been developed over the past year. It feels like a palpable upgrade from the Quest 2 and even sports some design and UX improvements over the more expensive Quest 3.</p><p>Obviously, there have to be <em>some</em> concessions to get to a $299 price point but there are surprisingly few. The biggest is the display stack, as it uses the same lenses and display from the Quest 2 but still features plenty of visual upgrades and tweaks. That includes a next-generation processor, improved rendering and processing, and much more. If you're looking for a next-gen VR headset upgrade from a Quest 2 at an affordable price, you've found it.</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S retails for $299 and includes 128GB of storage, while the Meta Quest 3S with 256GB of storage retails for $399. Both models come in a white colorway and come with a pair of Quest 3 touch controllers, a preinstalled cloth head strap, and a preinstalled cloth facial interface.</p><p>Every Meta Quest 3S comes with a free copy of Batman Arkham Shadow and 3 months of the Meta Quest Plus subscription service until April 2025.</p><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-3s-accessories-that-transfer-from-quest-2-and-3">Meta Quest 2 accessories work on a Quest 3S</a>, so you can keep some of those around instead of having to buy new ones. Likewise, most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories" target="_blank">best Quest 3 accessories</a> work on a Quest 3S, with the exception of the facial interface, which has a new design.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="dvZWqvmaCxLUBUcrdbA7AN" name="Wearing a Meta Quest 3S" alt="Wearing a Meta Quest 3S with the default cloth strap" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dvZWqvmaCxLUBUcrdbA7AN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta has learned a thing or two about headset comfort over the past few years, but that doesn't mean the Quest 3S is perfect. It's only a gram lighter than the Quest 3, which was a few grams heavier than the Quest 2. All of this, despite still shipping with a cloth strap that I find generally uncomfortable, although it's fine for short play sessions.</p><p>The biggest problem with the cloth strap is that it rests on the top of my ears and irritates my skin rather quickly. Meta is using the same Y-shaped top strap design it launched with the Quest 3, which means it better allocates weight across the head but still doesn't work anywhere near as well as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/bobovr-m3-pro-review-meta-quest-3-headstrap">BoboVR M3 Pro</a> head strap does, for instance.</p><p>Beyond that, though, the Quest 3S is just as comfortable as the Quest 3 out of the box and maybe even more so thanks to the new facial interface design. The new, more padded, and supple face pad that was preinstalled on the headset feels wonderful. Historically, I couldn't wait to swap out the facial interface with a third-party one, but I've been pleasantly surprised by how comfortable this one is.</p><p>The headset is also 20mm slimmer than the Quest 2, so it has a weight distribution closer to your face. Quest 3 is an additional 10mm slimmer than Quest 3S.</p>

<p>However there are still three main reasons to choose a good third-party facial interface replacement once reputable companies release them. First is hygiene. The cloth is nice and soft but also absorbs sweat. Grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Orzero-Compatible-Anti-Sweat-Waterproof-Accessories/dp/B0DJ6LX4V7/">$12 pair of silicone covers</a> for now, especially if you sweat a lot or share the headset with other people.</p><p>The second reason to replace the stock facial interface is because of lens fog. I haven't had issues with it during the review period because it's been cool and dry here, but as soon as the humidity ramps up again in half a year I'll need something more breathable. For now, Meta makes an excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-Breathable-Facial-Interface-Increases/dp/B09MJS71W4/">breathable facial interface</a> with semi-transparent sides. I used this one at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Quest 3S hands-on</a> event and loved it.</p><p>Third, if you use glasses, some third-party facial interfaces have built-in glasses spacing adjustments. The default Meta Quest 3 facial interface includes a way to adjust for glasses, but the one on the Quest 3S doesn't. You'll need to use the glasses spacer in the box to do this which doesn't offer as many spacing options as the Quest 3 method.</p>

<p>That said, the new interface design makes it <em>far</em> easier to swap out the facial interface than any other Quest headset to date. This has been improved with every generation, so it's good to see it continue to happen.</p><p>But even if you don't swap out any of these modular parts right away, I think short play sessions will be comfortable enough. Thankfully, all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest 3 accessories</a> work on the Quest 3S, except for the replacement of the facial interface. You'll need one specifically made for the Quest 3S.</p><p>Keep in mind that the Quest 3S does not have a 3.5mm audio jack, so if you want to use headphones instead of the excellent built-in speakers on the Quest 3S arms, I recommend picking up a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/PRISMXR-Low-Latency-Connection-Compatible-Playstation/dp/B0CDH3SMDW/" target="_blank">PrismXR Vega T1 earbuds</a>. Regular Bluetooth earbuds or headphones won't work in VR because Bluetooth's latency is too high. This can actually make you feel sick because of an odd disconnect between what your brain hears and what it sees.</p>

<p>In my testing, I've found that the Quest 3S has the best battery life of any modern Quest headset. On average, I got around two and a half hours of use from a single charge, with more power-hungry games like Batman Arkham Shadow bringing that down to around 2 hours.</p><p>I'd say if you were planning to just use the Quest 3S with the default head strap and facial interface, this is more than enough time before any kind of fatigue sets in. Grabbing a new head strap with built-in battery like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOBOVR-M3-Pro-Accessories-Compatible/dp/B0CJLG9SBR/">BoboVR M3 Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/KIWI-design-Boost-Battery-Compatible/dp/B0D6W88TCN/">Kiwi Design H4</a> will add several hours of battery life and significantly better comfort overall, making it a worthwhile $50 upgrade.</p>

<p>If you directly compare the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S, this section holds the only real differences you'll notice. The Meta Quest 3S uses the same display and Fresnel lenses as the Meta Quest 2, so if you've only ever used a Quest 1 or Quest 2, you probably won't be particularly disappointed in the Quest 3S's display or lenses.</p><p>All in all, they're fine and suit a $299 headset rather well. As with all Fresnel lenses, there's a small "sweet spot" right in the middle of each lens where you'll get the clearest view. Anything outside of this circle gets blurrier the closer you look to the edges.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The Meta Quest 3S uses the same lenses and display as the Quest 2, foregoing most next-generation upgrades from the more expensive Quest 3.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The 90-degree FoV on the Quest 3S's lenses feels a bit constricting compared to the substantially wider 110-degree FoV of the Quest 3. This difference cannot be understated, and it all melds together to show just how superior the lenses on the Quest 3 are.</p>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S's lenses also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-adjust-eye-distance-ipd-oculus-quest-2">adjust the same way as the Quest 2</a>, so if you're coming from a Quest 2 you'll know exactly what to do. The only difference is that there's no 1/2/3 preset number in the middle of the lenses that changes as you adjust the spacing. Meta says it cut this mechanism to keep the manufacturing cost of the headset as low as possible, allowing it to hit that $299 price point.</p><p>That being said, if you have an interpupillary distance (IPD) over 72mm you're probably going to find the Meta Quest 3S uncomfortable. If you find yourself in this boat, a 3D printed IPD expander <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4627924">like this one</a> will push the lenses out a bit and help.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>If you plan to work in VR or use it for a lot of text-based applications, it makes more sense to spend the extra money on a Quest 3.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Like the lenses, the display on the Meta Quest 3S is the same as the one on the Quest 2. It gets plenty bright, but the contrast is fairly low, the colors are a bit on the dull side, and the resolution is noticeably lower than the Quest 3's panels.</p><p>As far as clarity is concerned, I'd say the resolution difference between Quest 3 and Quest 3S is similar to playing games at 1440p vs 1080p. The Quest 3S isn't as sharp, and fine detail gets a bit lost, but it's not offensively lower resolution.</p><p>If there's any one area where the resolution and lenses make a big difference, it's for folks who want to work in VR. If that's going to be a big part of your headset usage, stick with the Quest 3.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-quest-3s-controllers-and-hand-tracking"><span>Meta Quest 3S: Controllers and hand tracking</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NhxMWMZ7ttTYBw5L27srRT" name="Meta-Quest-3S-hands-on-controllers-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Meta Quest 3S controllers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NhxMWMZ7ttTYBw5L27srRT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S and Quest 3 use identical controllers. These new controllers ditch the LED ring and tighten up some ergonomics for a much smaller profile than the Quest 2's controllers. Tracking is still done with LEDs, though, which are situated around the controller face and handles.</p><p>Tracking is enhanced through better camera positioning around the headset—particularly the lower side-mounted cameras, which can see better along the sides and below the headset than on the Quest 2—and Meta's Horizon OS, which fills in any visual tracking gaps with gyro sensor data from inside the controller and an AI algorithm that predicts hand position based on arm and shoulder movements.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Meta Quest 3S uses the same advanced controllers as the Quest 3 and are powered by a single AA battery.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Each controller is powered by a single AA battery. Based on my extended usage of the Quest 3 over the past year, you'll only need to swap them out once <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-long-quest-3-controller-battery-lasts">every two months </a>or so, depending on how often you play. I recommend picking up these cheap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Rechargeable-Batteries-8-Pack-Pre-charged/dp/B00CWNMV4G/">Amazon Basics rechargeable AA batteries</a> for a few bucks so you can keep reusing them.</p><p>Each controller has a battery door that can be swapped out for any number of excellent controller accessories, like these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/amvr-quest-3-controller-grips-review">AMVR controller grips</a>, which add grip and help balance the controllers better with a handy hand strap.</p><p>Quest 3S also supports what's called Inside-Out Body Tracking, which only a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-body-tracking" target="_blank">handful of games currently support</a>. However, developers may start to use it more now that another Quest headset supports the feature. With this, in-game character movements will feel more realistic as the headset can properly align the virtual character's torso, shoulders, and arms with your actual movements in real life.</p>

<p>Meta Quest 3S has also been outfitted with two IR illuminators on the front, positioned on the outside of each triple camera array on the front. This is a new feature for any Quest headset and allows the Quest 3S to see completely in the dark, provided you're in a small enough room.</p><p>I tested different rooms at night with the lights off, and while tracking didn't work at all in my living room, it worked perfectly in any bedroom I tried it in. Essentially, as long as the Quest 3S can see walls, it will be able to track spatial movement in the dark.</p>

<p>Likewise, hand tracking is better than ever—particularly in low light—than with any Quest headset to date. While I found daytime tracking performance and accuracy to be essentially identical to the more expensive Quest 3, Quest 3S can also track hands in the dark.</p><p>That should help significantly in some dimly lit rooms when playing hand-tracked games or during casual entertainment when you're just using your hands to navigate the UI.</p>

<p>While you'll notice the controller differences and slimmer profile of the headset when unboxing it, nothing prepares you for the color mixed reality vision until you've tried it. It's not as clear as an Apple Vision Pro or even the Meta Quest 3 because of the lenses, but it's beyond just a generational upgrade from the Quest 2. If anything, it's like going from a 1950s black-and-white TV to a color HDTV.</p><p>The Meta Quest 3S uses the same 4MP dual front-facing cameras as the Quest 3 and tends to look even brighter thanks to the lenses. Yes, Fresnel lenses aren't as crisp as the pancake lenses on Quest 3, but they allow more light in from the display giving it a distinctly brighter look.</p><p>Because the lenses aren't as sharp and the display's resolution is lower, it's a bit harder to read text on a phone while wearing the headset, but this isn't a common mixed reality use case, anyway.</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S doesn't include a depth sensor like the Quest 3 has, but that doesn't seem to affect its mixed reality performance in my testing. As you can see in the video above, the Quest 3S is a little slower at mapping than the Quest 3 but not inordinately so.</p><p>It took the Quest 3S roughly nine seconds longer to map my living room, but some of that time was because I ran into an early bug where hand tracking in some UI elements felt laggy. Realistically, it probably only took the Quest 3S around seven seconds longer to do the actual mapping, which is impressive given that it just uses cameras to do the work.</p>

It's a <strong>substantial upgrade</strong> from all prior Meta Quest headsets which required you to perform an awkward and extremely unreliable double-tap on the side of the headset.</p>

<p>Because the VR gaming industry is relatively small compared to traditional consoles, the Meta Quest 3S's closest competition is made up of Meta headsets. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-2" target="_blank">Quest 3S replaces the Quest 2</a> as the new standard in affordable VR. Its processor is 100% more powerful than the Quest 2, enabling it to play far richer and more detailed games and render impressive color mixed reality in your room.</p><p>It's an easy recommendation to upgrade from a Quest 2 because of the price, but the full next-generation upgrade can be found in the Meta Quest 3. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-vs-quest-3">Compared to the Quest 3S</a>, the Meta Quest 3 sports next-generation lenses with a 20-degree wider field of view (FoV), significantly enhanced clarity, a higher resolution display, and better contrast and colors than the Quest 3S. Surprisingly, Quest 3 doesn't include IR illuminators, so it can't play in the dark like Quest 3S.</p><p>If you're a PCVR-only player, it would also make more sense to get a Quest 3 because of the enhanced clarity brought about by the lenses and display.

<p><strong>You should buy if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best of virtual reality and mixed reality but don't want to spend $500 on a Quest 3.</li><li>You want to play Quest 3-exclusive games and apps.</li><li>You're new to VR and don't want to invest a lot in case you don't like it.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You plan to work in VR. The lenses and display make it difficult to read fine text in this setting.</li><li>You don't like Fresnel lenses.</li></ul>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S is a triumph in every regard. It's an unbelievable bargain at $299, yet it still exhibits the best mixed reality and virtual reality gaming available today. The only real compromises are the lenses and display, which are worse than the Quest 3 but not detrimentally so. If I had to compare the experience to more traditional gaming specs, I'd say it's similar to the difference between a 1080p and 4K setup.</p><p>Otherwise, the Meta Quest 3S is everything you need in a VR and mixed-reality headset today. It not only offers the highest-quality standalone VR games available—including the incredible <em>free</em> pack-in Batman Arkham Shadow—but it also connects to any PC and can play PCVR games completely wirelessly. It's a win-win-win for anyone looking to get into VR or upgrade from an older headset.</p><p>There are certainly reasons to choose a Quest 3 over a Quest 3S, but for most people, the price point and overall value of the Quest 3S make it a must-buy console this Holiday season.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google&apos;s latest major Android OS update is reportedly more of a hindrance than a help for a few past-gen devices.</p><p>Users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1g8cucs/pixel_6_bricked_after_enabling_private_space/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">took to Reddit</a> over the weekend to voice several issues after updating to Android 15 on a Pixel 6 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-15-killing-pixel-6-devices/">Android Police</a>). The OP (original poster) of the thread, GegoByte, posted a PSA to users stating, "don&apos;t enable the private space feature if you upgrade to Android 15. I unlocked the private space area, opened an app I installed in it, and it bricked my Pixel 6."</p><p>The user added that they&apos;ve been unable to turn their device on or reboot it using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6377386?hl=en#:~:text=If%20your%20phone%20is%20frozen,about%2030%20seconds%20to%20restart.">the typical methods</a> explained by Google. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1g8cucs/comment/lsy1fr4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Another user</a> offered the option of heading into the phone&apos;s boot menu; however, the original reporter claims they cannot reach it.</p><p>Curiously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1g86k1t/pixel_6_pro_dead_after_android_15_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">another report</a> states their Pixel 6 Pro died after updating to Android 15 despite having a 45% charge remaining. Plugging the device into its charging cable didn&apos;t produce a response and Google&apos;s listed troubleshooting methods proved fruitless. More importantly, the user states this occurred <em>after </em>enabling Private Spaces.</p><p>Though these issues are terrible, they don&apos;t seem widespread. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1g8cucs/comment/lsydzq1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user states</a> they&apos;ve updated to Android 15 <em>and </em>enabled Private Spaces on their Pixel 6 with no problem. Regardless, the most sound piece of advice is to contact Google Support if your Pixel 6/6 Pro is encountering problems.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google about the issues concerning Android 15/Private Spaces. We will update this article when we hear back.</p>

<p>The Pixel 6 is seemingly having a rough 2024. Earlier this year, the series encountered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6-factory-reset-might-zap-your-phone">an issue with factory resets</a>. The total wipe reportedly bricked Pixel 6 phones in July. After resetting, users experienced a "Cannot load Android system" error message. The error makes one believe there&apos;s corrupt data or something else wrong with the device, which pushes the phone into another (failed) reset.</p><p>The issue was fixed during the August 2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-august-2024-update">security patch</a>. Of course, if the current issue is tied to Private Spaces exclusively on the Pixel 6, then the only path is to leave it disabled. Still, hopefully, Google can cook up a fix quicker this time for those affected.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-now-makes-pixel-phones-a-fortress-against-thieves-and-fraudsters">Android 15</a> started hitting Pixel devices last week. The major OS update isn&apos;t flashy, but it delivers several crucial security features to protect a user&apos;s data against theft. Pixel owners are picking up three features under the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">Theft Protection</a>" banner, like "Theft Detection Lock," "Offline Lock," and "Remote Lock."</p><p>Additionally, Google&apos;s phones grabbed a huge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">October feature drop</a>. The update is full of features like "Audio Magic Eraser," a Gemini Extension for Pixel Screenshots, and more. Moreover, a few of Google&apos;s past-gen "Legacy" phones grab several next-gen features to keep them feeling fresh. Private Spaces is with Android 15 and enters as a way for users to hide sensitive apps with important personal data.</p>
