<p>Much to the chagrin of some of those in the Android space, Apple has largely been considered the "measuring stick" for both hardware and software. Arguments have been made that the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei, and Samsung, among others surpassed Apple in the hardware department long ago. </p><p>The same can&apos;t be said about the software, despite Apple locking down iOS and iPadOS in the most frustrating ways. However, after seeing what&apos;s happened in 2024, I can&apos;t help but wonder if Apple lost its touch.</p><p>Over the past year, Apple has entered a new product category with the Vision Pro headset while releasing refreshes of practically every other device in its lineup. Plus, we&apos;re expecting at least one more announcement as rumors suggest Apple has an event planned this month to unveil new Macs and hopefully a refreshed iPad Mini.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-iphone-15-pro-max-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple has proven that companies don&apos;t need to reinvent the hardware wheel when releasing a refreshed device. For instance, the only major differences between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and iPhone 16 Pro are a new "Camera Control" button and bezels that are ever-so-slightly slimmer than before. </p><p>The majority of the focus from Apple&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16-series-has-me-convinced-apple-needs-a-foldable">iPhone 16</a> event was showcasing the various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-outsourcing-openai-feels-unapple-but-unsurprising">AI-powered features</a> slated to come to iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. There&apos;s just one problem though — none of the exciting features are actually available yet. So basically, Apple just took the same approach that we used to lambast other companies in that it announced features that won&apos;t actually be available at launch. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cwzcPjjSGaom2cFv4uLqNh" name="iphone-16-pro-max-render-showing-apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="iPhone 16 Pro in hand glowing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cwzcPjjSGaom2cFv4uLqNh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple )</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hardly any of these features were available with the final release of iOS 18, which arrived alongside the iPhone 16 series. Instead, it seems that Apple will be rolling out features in waves, starting with iOS 18.1. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/22/apple-intelligence-features-timing/">MacRumors </a>laid out the rumors of when to expect features to arrive pretty well, and here&apos;s how things are looking:</p>

<p>If Apple sticks to this rumored timeline, it means that the company&apos;s latest device won&apos;t have all of the new features until it&apos;s already been on the market for six months. There&apos;s also the potential of even more frustration as you can&apos;t watch TV for more than an hour without seeing an iPhone commercial touting Apple Intelligence. </p>

<p>Just a little bit of good old-fashioned deception because we know Apple doesn&apos;t want to miss out on the holiday shopping season. </p><p>While delaying features isn&apos;t great, it&apos;s not as bad as what iPad Pro owners have had to endure. Apple introduced and released the M4-powered iPad Pro back in May 2024. This remains the only device in Apple&apos;s lineup to be powered by the M4 chip, which is likely to be rectified later in October. </p><p>The problem is that iPadOS 18 was released in mid-September, and the update was removed for those with the M4 iPad Pro the next day. Some found that after installing the update, the iPad Pro would essentially be turned into a very expensive metal and glass brick. It wasn&apos;t until today (October 4) that Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18-release-notes">released</a> iPadOS 18.0.1, which should include the fix for whatever the original issue was. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="LYGE7SxkPn9yxorr7xZofK" name="ipad-pro-2024-imore.jpg" alt="2024 iPad Pro M4 on desk with Magic Keyboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LYGE7SxkPn9yxorr7xZofK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gerald Lynch / iMore)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s more than two weeks without being able to use Apple&apos;s latest software with its more powerful (and expensive) iPad model. As someone who has an M4 iPad Pro, this has been one of the few times that I&apos;m thankful to be on the "beta train," as I haven&apos;t come across any of those problems. </p><p>Originally, I thought this was rather unprecedented for Apple, and then I remembered the iPhone 14 launch. This is when Apple made the move to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-android-esim-transfer">eSIM only</a> in the U.S., but the company had to rush out a day-one software update as many were unable to actually register an eSIM. So, I guess things have been out of whack for longer than I thought.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-camera-2.jpg" alt="Camera app on Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;m not ignorant of what&apos;s happened in the Android space, but I would argue that at least Samsung and even Google have leapfrogged Apple when it comes to updates. Both companies announced a plethora of new AI features for its respective devices, and the majority of those features were available as soon as you could download the update. The most obvious exception to this is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/lesson-learned-with-google-zoom-enhance-feature">Zoom Enhance</a>, a feature Google announced for the Pixel 8 Pro, but it didn&apos;t actually arrive until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. </p><p>But as far as hardware goes, I think Apple&apos;s basically run out of ideas. First, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">Action Button</a> was added, and now we have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">Camera Control</a> button. Besides that, how much more does Apple think it can slim down the bezels and use that as a selling point? Oh, and I forgot that the non-Pro iPhones now have a rearranged camera module. Woo-hoo. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LSsPjMuKnyq2HWhrp8LD9C" name="TECNO-Phantom-V-Fold-2-vs-Honor-Magic-v3-09.jpg" alt="Comparing the TECNO Phantom V Fold 2 with the Honor Magic V3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LSsPjMuKnyq2HWhrp8LD9C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Apple is sticking to the slab design, almost every other Android phone maker is either working on or has released a foldable phone. Some, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola</a>, have stuck to the flip phone form factor, while the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Xiaomi</a>, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Tecno</a> have multiple foldable phone options. </p><p>I have no doubt that Apple already has a foldable iPhone prototype, regardless of whether it flips or folds. The problem is that rumors indicate Apple continues to push back the release of a foldable device. Back in 2022, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-apple-waiting-too-long-to-make-a-foldable-phone">we pondered</a> whether Apple was already waiting too long, and currently, the rumor mill points to 2027 as the year that we&apos;ll finally see Apple get into the game. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HzjSRkNW25JJUjuQLCszCW" name="apple-foldable-hero.jpg" alt="Holding a mockup of a potential iPhone foldable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HzjSRkNW25JJUjuQLCszCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We can only surmise that this is because Apple wants to do everything it can to avoid the backlash that other phone makers have seen with folding screens that break unexpectedly. Even in 2024, it&apos;s still a problem that occasionally crops up with new devices and is more common with older models. But at some point, when is Apple just going to take the leap?</p><p>Taking a leap is exactly what Apple did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-pro">Vision Pro</a>, its first foray into the world of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headsets</a>. Supposedly, this is meant to be Apple CEO Tim Cook&apos;s "legacy," and while that may be true, the current iteration is simply out of reach for many, especially at a time when you can walk into practically any big box store and walk out with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-hands-on">Meta Quest headset</a> and don&apos;t need to sell a kidney to do so. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37" name="Meta-Quest-3S-vs-Meta-Quest-3-front-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the Meta Quest 3S vs. Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GYkrJzMDhPWLDJzoBuhj37.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Vision Pro was always going to be quite expensive, not just because of the R&D that went into it but also because of the hardware and technology it packs. For reference, the Vision Pro features a per-eye resolution of 3660 x 3200, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> is equipped with a per-eye resolution of 2064 x 2208. Plus, Apple relies on micro-OLED displays, whereas Meta&apos;s headset utilizes LCD displays. </p><p>I know it&apos;s not really fair to compare a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/october-prime-day-meta-quest-deals-2024-should-you-wait-for-big-deal-days-or-buy-now">$500 headset</a> with one that <em>starts </em>at $3,500. But that&apos;s part of the point that I&apos;m trying to make, as Apple is already so far behind in its appeal to the general consumer that I don&apos;t know if future iterations will be able to capture the masses. </p><p>The longer Apple waits to release a foldable phone, the more likely it will end up being far too expensive compared to the competition. I don&apos;t have a crystal ball, and we have no idea what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone market</a> will look like three years from now. But it&apos;s 2024, and we already have tri-foldable phones with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">Huawei Mate XT</a>. Plus, companies have been working on phones with rollable displays, although I think those will be even less popular than the current crop of foldables. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Hf5aoDyaQK5sonvTkf2Wib" name="huawei-mate-xt-tri-fold-screen-unfolded.jpeg" alt="The Huawei Mate XT tri-fold offers a 10-2.inch display experience." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hf5aoDyaQK5sonvTkf2Wib.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1406" height="791" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Part of me thinks that Apple is just coasting as much as it can. The company probably didn&apos;t expect to see the explosion in the popularity of AI, so the "brain trust" came up with ideas and announced them, even though they were nowhere near being ready for primetime. </p><p>Another aspect is that Tim Cook has been CEO of Apple for more than 13 years, and there are rumblings that he may be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/who-is-john-ternus-the-man-most-likely-to-replace-tim-cook-as-apples-ceo-when-he-steps-down-13769379.html">eyeing retirement</a>. With much of the focus being put on trying to leave a lasting impression in the form of a hardware release, I can&apos;t help but wonder if we won&apos;t see anything revolutionary again until after someone else takes up the mantle. </p><p>As someone who spent time as an iPhone fanboy before pivoting to Android (and now dual-wielding), I&apos;m just kind of disappointed. There are still some things I think an iPhone and iPad offer over their Android equivalents, but that list has never been smaller. </p>

Samsung states Home Insight will turn off idle devices "at specific times" or if the user is away from home.</p><p>Home Insight is also able to collect and analyze data such as device usage, history, and other "home statistics." All of this likely contributes to its optimization features for a seamless smart home. The publication spotted during the SDC 2024 keynote that Home Insight can remind users to turn off a device accidentally left active.</p><p>The conference teased that Home Insight can also leverage dates in your calendar, such as birthdays, and suggest fun activities using your devices.</p><p>Moreover, all of Samsung&apos;s devices with a screen will run SmartThings Hub and receive Edge AI technology. This software will "embed" AI into a consumer&apos;s devices for a better experience and usability.</p><p>Samsung highlighted its partnership with Kohler, which will help monitor a user&apos;s water usage within SmartThings. Additionally, the software&apos;s Door Lock is set to debut in Digital Home Key in Samsung Wallet in 2025.</p><p>The company teased further integration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-underrated-feature-device-files-upload">YouTube Music</a> during SDC 2024. According to SamMobile, users can pair lights connected to SmartThings to a set of songs from YouTube Music. The integration will reportedly pair well with Philips Hue lights, Wiz, Yeelight, and Lifx.</p>

<p>With so much ahead for Samsung&apos;s SmartThings, the company will build <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/samsung-smartthings-matter-1-2-support-update">upon a previous major update</a> from this summer. In July, the company rolled out an update that let users pair refrigerators, air conditioners, dishwashers, and laundry washing machines to SmartThings.</p><p>The update included "Shareable Routines," a new Hub Manager introduced to the app. Users could share routines that involved a singular device or multiple devices in a home with others. These routines can be easily handed out via a QR code for family members and guests.</p><p>Specifically for device pairing, those updates concerned Matter 1.2-ready smart home devices. However, the CSA has since detailed the contents of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-3-upgrade">Matter 1.3 upgrade</a>, which will bring even more devices into the fold, like stoves, dryers, and EV chargers.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Pixel 9 ups the ante with serious advancements in baseband security, building on years of solid protection.</li><li>Exploiting baseband firmware flaws could let attackers break in, gain control, and even install hidden backdoors, putting user data in danger.</li><li>Google’s tech updates, like the upgraded Bound Sanitizer and integer overflow sanitizer, help block harmful code and ensure accurate calculations.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google breaks down how it keeps the Pixel 9&apos;s baseband security locked tight, basically claiming that it&apos;s now a fortress against modem vulnerabilities.</p><p>For years, Pixel devices have been equipped with solid baseband security. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> takes it up a notch, showcasing some serious advancements in baseband protection, as noted in Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/pixel-proactive-security-cellular-modems.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>The baseband is a weak spot for malicious attacks, so it’s been a major focus for Google’s security team. </p><p>Google points out that exploiting flaws in the baseband firmware could let attackers break into device security, gain higher privileges, run arbitrary code, and install hidden backdoors, putting user data at risk.</p><p>With the Pixel 9, the company&apos;s security team has hit a turning point, completely revamping the baseband architecture.</p><p>Google mentioned cases where attackers use cloned base stations to send manipulated network packets that can be executed from different locations. These attacks are a big threat to smartphone security, especially since the baseband is more vulnerable within the device&apos;s attack surface.</p><p>However, users often overlook the complex software that powers smartphones, Google pointed out, making baseband security a top priority that shouldn&apos;t come at the cost of performance.</p><p>While Google&apos;s updates might sound too technical, they&apos;re all aimed at keeping users safe from all sorts of nasty attacks. One key improvement is the upgraded Bound Sanitizer, which blocks unauthorized code from accessing the phone&apos;s memory, making it much harder for attackers to run harmful code.</p><p>Plus, Google has also improved the integer overflow sanitizer to ensure numbers are read correctly, stopping attackers from messing with the phone&apos;s internal calculations.</p><p>The search giant has beefed up security even more by adding stack canaries—kind of like digital tripwires that catch malicious code trying to sneak in. This tweak helps keep things on track by restricting code to specific paths, making it way harder for hackers to mess with how info flows inside the device.</p><p>Lastly, Google has upgraded Auto-initialized stack variables, allowing the device to make better use of all available memory. This change lowers the risk of hackers exploiting leftover data to leak sensitive information.</p><p>Even if the tech lingo sounds complicated, the gist of Google&apos;s updates is a big step up in baseband security for the Pixel 9, cementing its status as being among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">leading Android smartphones</a> on the market.</p>

<ul><li>At SDC 2024, Samsung had a Galaxy S24 Ultra on deck that rocked its upcoming One UI 7 (Android 15) software.</li><li>From the demo, it was discovered that the notifications and Quick Settings panel will be separated, giving users a full view of both areas.</li><li>One UI 7 is also shifting the search bar to the bottom of the app drawer UI.</li><li>Samsung confirmed One UI 7 will arrive in 2025 alongside the Galaxy S25 and the beta is likely to begin "by the end of" 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung had more in store during its Developers Conference this week, which involved a close look at One UI 7&apos;s changes.</p><p>One UI 7 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>) has been rumored to feature a "major" shift in Samsung&apos;s software design all year. Images captured by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/one-ui-7-simple-impactful-and-emotive-ui-changes-explored/">SammyGuru</a> show Samsung&apos;s teasers of a few One UI 7 changes that bring the OS into an Apple-like world (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/10/04/samsung-one-ui-7-ios-copy-preview/">9to5Google</a>). Kicking off those changes is the Quick Settings menu, which offers a much curvier appearance with pill-shaped options.</p><p>It seems Samsung is looking to feature smaller, fatter sliders for your device&apos;s brightness level. The publication noted in Samsung&apos;s demo that you can move the "blocks" featured on the updated Quick Settings menu. Moreover, the icons in the larger "block" with airplane mode, flashlight, etc., can be swapped out and customized further.</p><p>The Korean OEM is moving toward more customization with One UI 7 and moving the options/icons within blocks would give users agency over <em>how </em>their settings should look.</p>

<p>Another sharp change is the notification panel. The upcoming OS update separates a user&apos;s alerts from the Quick Settings panel. What was shown during SDC 2024 was a panel that stacks your notifications in a pill-shaped design with an arrow to expand for more information. Much like the Quick Settings panel (and other screens), the notification center has a low depth of field.</p><p>The time and date are listed at the top left with a "settings" button and "clear" on the bottom. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRM91R0EveE&ab_channel=SamMobile">SamMobile</a> went into detail about this separation, revealing that One UI 7 lets users swipe down the left side of their display for notifications, leaving the right side for Quick Settings.</p><p>Some other smaller changes in One UI 7 include a "Side button" options page redesign. Users will find options unified under the "Double Press" and "Press and hold" choices. The app drawer has picked up a welcome change as its search bar drops to the bottom of the UI.</p><p>What this early glimpse from SDC 2024 does is (essentially) confirm many of the rumors about One UI 7. It seems Samsung is truly moving toward a more HyperOS (Xiaomi) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-one-ui-7-might-take-a-big-page-out-of-apples-ios-playbook">iOS-inspired design</a> with its Android 15 skin, as evidenced by the Quick Settings panel changes, notifications, and other refreshed elements.</p><p>While several aspects of One UI 7 are changing, and likely looping in more Galaxy AI, we&apos;re still <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dreary-one-ui-7-beta-forum-update">staring at a massive delay</a>. It was reported that Samsung was still holding internal discussions about the software&apos;s features and working through "stability problems" in September. However, Samsung confirmed One UI 7 (Android 15) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-wont-hit-beta-until-end-of-this-year">won&apos;t arrive until 2025</a>.</p><p>It&apos;s expected to drop alongside the Galaxy S25 series, marking an extreme departure from the company&apos;s typical update cadence. Despite that, the company is expected to begin its One UI 7  beta "before the year ends."</p>

Go pick up the Galaxy Watch 7 right now, for instance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQ3MML"><strong>you&apos;ll score up to 20% off your purchase</strong></a>, no strings attached. This is the biggest discount that the flagship smartwatch has EVER received, and all you have to do is hit that Add to Cart button. Don&apos;t mind a last-gen device? 2023&apos;s Galaxy Watch 6 is also receiving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C797946T"><strong>a record-smashing 43% discount</strong></a> at Amazon. </p><p>It&apos;s unusual to see such major discounts before Big Deal Days kicks off, and it makes me wonder if the smartwatches are going to sell out quickly when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-prime-day-early-samsung-galaxy-deals-phones-tablets-and-more">Prime Day Samsung deals</a> officially go live next week. Needless to say, if you&apos;d rather be safe than sorry, I&apos;d place your order as soon as possible. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Epic Games is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-sues-google-and-samsung-anti-competitive-case">suing Google again</a> along with Samsung, claiming that unfair practices make it hard to get exposure to its third-party software offerings. In this claim, Epic takes issue with Samsung&apos;s Auto Blocker feature, which stops the installation of software that is not from official trusted sources. Specifically, Epic claims that it&apos;s anti-competitive that auto-blocker is on by default and that Google strong-armed Samsung into making it that way.</p><p>This feels very much like the last time Epic sued Google, claiming the company was anti-competitive and abusing monopoly power. That&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/google-loses-antitrust-court-battle-against-epic">a lawsuit Epic won</a>, even if it didn&apos;t have the results Epic had hoped for. What&apos;s not being mentioned is that this all stems from the fact that Epic doesn&apos;t want to pay Google (or Apple) fees to process payments and transactions.</p>
<p>I don&apos;t blame Epic for not wanting to pay 30% of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-finalizes-order-requiring-fortnite-maker-epic-games-pay-245-million-tricking-users-making">mountain of money it makes</a> from players when it thinks it could find a way to keep that cash for itself. I also want companies to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-its-good-that-companies-like-google-face-antitrust-cases">hold Google accountable</a> and challenge all of its policies anytime there is even a hint of anti-competitive behavior. </p><p>I&apos;m just tired of this particular case because one side is as bad as the other.</p>
<p>Google says it had nothing to do with Samsung&apos;s decision to build and deploy the auto-blocker feature. I&apos;ve reached out to see if Google has more to say but in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DaveKSecure/status/1840925172691583003">statement posted to X</a> Google Security and privacy team member David Kleidermacher says:</p><p><em>"Epic’s latest lawsuit is a meritless and dangerous move. Google did not request that Samsung create their Auto Blocker feature. </em></p><p><em>While Android allows sideloading, Google and the security community have warned users for years about the real risks associated with downloading apps directly from the web. In the U.S., federal agencies, NGOs, and fintech associations have guidance underscoring this issue. </em></p><p><em>Governments around the world have requested additional solutions to help further protect users from the fraud, theft, and abuse from sideloaded apps that are causing real harm to people’s lives. That’s why Google offers its own safety features such as Google Play Protect, which checks for harmful apps on a user’s device, regardless of where the app was downloaded. </em></p><p><em>Android device makers are free to innovate and design additional safety features for their devices. To make this about access to a game is deliberately misleading; this is about user safety. And Epic’s lawsuit puts their corporate interests above user protections."</em></p>

<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeny replied:</p><p><em>"The 21 steps required to install Epic Games Store on new Samsung Android devices are full of intentional dead ends and misleading scare screens characterizing Epic as an “unknown” source (y’all know us) and our software as dangerous (y’all know it’s not).</em></p><p><em>Windows and MacOS demonstrate multiple successful and proportionate approaches to blocking malware. None involve blocking safe software from reputable companies or portraying known software as unknown as Google and Samsung are doing. Google’s scheme is dishonest and misleading."</em></p>
<p>Obviously, social media is no place for meaningful discourse, and this is just another back-and-forth of two companies trying to one-up with each other.</p><p>I have no idea if Google asked Samsung to implement the Auto Blocker feature. I do know that Google allows phone makers to implement security solutions if they want to do so.</p><p>Saying the steps to disable the Auto Blocker feature are difficult is subjective. Trying to claim Epic is a trusted source in the security sense is absurd (Samsung can not verify Epic&apos;s code), and claiming that Windows and macOS don&apos;t block "safe" companies from installing unsigned system-level code without user interaction is even more absurd.</p><p>I can&apos;t take either statement as proof of anything and neither should you. That&apos;s because every company involved has shown it will do and say anything to sway public opinion. </p><p>So here&apos;s what we actually know.</p>

<p>None of the companies involved want to infect your phone with malware or wish any ill will on you in any way. They want you to be happy with your purchase (whether that be a phone or an app) and be willing to buy again.</p><p>Mobile operating systems are not like the ones you might use on a desktop, and anyone trying to equate them is being silly. You can install an "app store" on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-convert-windows-laptop-chromebook">Windows computer</a> because that app store isn&apos;t doing anything critical with system files; if it wants even rudimentary access to certain folders it requires you to approve it. MacOS is the same, and Linux distributions are even worse/better when it comes to permissions. What works on Windows does not work on Android, and it&apos;s time we all stopped thinking like that.</p>
<p>Tools are needed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">keep users safe</a> because most users aren&apos;t interested in how this all works. You might want to know all about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-sideloading">sideloading</a> and file system permissions, and I might want to know about them, but not everyone cares. We all deserve some level of protection. Balancing that is difficult, but it&apos;s generally best to lean to the side of "security," even if it means an extra step when it comes to disabling those tools.</p><p>Epic might win this lawsuit and Google will appeal again. We might even see a few changes to the way things are done when all the dust settles. But Epic is never going to get the validation it seems to desperately want and the company is not on your side. </p><p>It&apos;s on Epic&apos;s side.</p>

Both phones deliver a singular vision of what Google sees in the future of Pixel phones, offering an identical experience at two distinct sizes.</p><p>Since there&apos;s no real difference between these two phones other than their size, we&apos;re combining the reviews to give you a better look at the best Pixel 9 experience available. We&apos;ve been using both models interchangeably over the past month and have come away disappointed about problems that have plagued Pixels for years. Thankfully, many of Google&apos;s latest feature additions help offset those disappointing feelings.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking to pick up a Google Pixel 9 Pro or Google Pixel 9 Pro XL this year, read on to find out why that&apos;s a great choice for some folks, while others might want to look elsewhere for their next smartphone upgrade.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL are now officially available as of August 22, 2024. Both models offer a choice of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage, as well as 16GB of RAM. You can choose from either size in a range of colors, including Obsidian (black), Porcelain (white), Hazel (grey), and Rose Quartz (pink).</p><p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 with 128GB of storage, while the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL starts at $1099 with 128GB of storage. You can buy the Pixel 9 series in any of the following countries:</p>
<ul><li><strong>NAMER: </strong>US, Canada</li><li><strong>EMEA:</strong> Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Finland, France, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, UK</li><li><strong>APAC: </strong>Australia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan</li></ul>
<p>All Pixel 9 models include Pixel VPN at no additional cost, which helps protect you while on the go and connecting to potentially unscrupulous public Wi-Fi hotspots. Google is also including one year of Gemini Advanced with every Google Pixel 9 Pro or 9 Pro XL, which would normally cost $20 per month with the AI-tier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One subscription</a>.</p><p>Each Google Pixel 9 Pro box contains no plastic and is impressively environmentally friendly.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5qjmyvhuj5Y9BbVDENCrpE" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-7.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL in tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5qjmyvhuj5Y9BbVDENCrpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the exception of a few tweaks here and there, Google has largely kept the same design that was initially introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>. However, we&apos;ve slowly seen more and more phone makers adopt an iPhone-like design with flat edges and flat screens. Google jumped aboard this trend with the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL. Gone is the combination of curved glass and aluminum, and in its place, we have flat edges as far as the eye can see.</p><p>As soon as I saw the Pixel 9 series in person, I immediately thought that this was just an iPhone. Sure, the buttons, colors, and camera housing are different, but I haven&apos;t been able to shake the idea that Google made a Pixel iPhone. This isn&apos;t a bad thing by any means, but it&apos;s just something I think is rather interesting.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rperGrMLvNzKanmJfUdkZ6" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-iphone-15-pro-max-1.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rperGrMLvNzKanmJfUdkZ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the Pixel 9 and the 9 Pro Fold, Google opted to use a polished aluminum finish with the 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL. I understand the need to try and differentiate the Pro from the non-Pro models, but I still prefer the feeling of brushed aluminum over polished.</p><p>While a polished frame might be more eye-catching to some, it won&apos;t take long for fingerprints and smudges to ruin everything. I also found both the 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL to be a bit slippier to use, resulting in me slapping a case on the phones as soon as they arrived.</p>

<p>In previous years, I would usually head over to the dbrand website and find a skin that would match whatever phone I was switching to. Then, I would grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe ring adapter</a>, sticking it to the dbrand skin, so I could enjoy the plethora of MagSafe accessories at my disposal.</p><p>I was hoping that Google would kill two birds with one stone for me, but alas, there&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-google-pixel-9-support-qi2-wireless-charging">no Qi2 support</a> on any of the Pixel 9 models. Thankfully, my our favorite case maker, Thinborne, is here to save the day with its excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinborne-Compatible-Aramid-Magnetic-Minimalist/dp/B0D86M1X4D/">Aramid Fiber Thin Case</a> that&apos;s also MagSafe-compatible.</p>

<p>I was rather surprised that Google released its Pro phone in two different sizes. It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t think this is the right move, but I just didn&apos;t see Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/there-are-too-many-pixel-phones">adding another phone to its ever-growing lineup</a>. Nevertheless, I&apos;m of the mindset that having a small "pro" phone is a great way to potentially attract more people to make the switch to the world of Pixel.</p><p>Besides the physical screen size, these displays are practically identical. They can reach 3000 nits and offer Google&apos;s "Smooth Display" variable refresh rate. With the exception of following the trend of displays that can get brighter, it&apos;s all pretty much what you&apos;d expect from a flagship phone.</p><p>The colors pop, the screens look great, and yeah, that&apos;s pretty much all I can say.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2XTFe28XWSvVLQ4gKWJ4dm" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-display-fingerprint-sensor-01.jpg" alt="An up-close look at the new in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2XTFe28XWSvVLQ4gKWJ4dm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing that ended up causing quite a bit of frustration was the in-screen fingerprint sensor. When using these phones without a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-screen-protectors">screen protector</a>, everything works as advertised. That all changed as soon as we installed a screen protector on the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>Currently, I&apos;ve only used the screen protector that comes with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">Thinborne case</a>, so I&apos;m not sure if this is to blame, but unlocking the phone has become a hassle. It seems to be less of a problem during the day, but as soon as I&apos;m in an area with little light, it just doesn&apos;t work.</p><p>After a couple of days, I remembered there&apos;s actually a toggle in the Settings app to help combat this issue. However, after enabling the "Screen Protector Mode," there literally hasn&apos;t been a difference.</p><p>Since I spend the majority of my time at home, this isn&apos;t really all that much of an issue. A recent trip to New York for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/new-2024samsung-lenovo-chromebooks-hands-on">Google&apos;s Chromebook Showcase</a> quickly reaffirmed my stance on embedded fingerprint sensors. I really, and I mean REALLY, wish Google would just integrate the sensor into the Power button. It already does this with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and Pixel Tablet, but I think it&apos;s time for it to come to the phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4Pcpty7fGkKAHMEjU7xpE" name="google-pixel-9-pro-with-pixel-9-pro-fold-1.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro next to Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Pcpty7fGkKAHMEjU7xpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can&apos;t tell you how frustrating and annoying it is to be trying to catch a subway, only to get tied up at the gate because your fingerprint didn&apos;t authenticate tap-to-pay. It only worked for me once or twice, and more often than not, I ended up just using face recognition instead.</p><p>Seeing as I don&apos;t experience the same PWM tribulations as my compadre and Android Central senior content producer, Nick Sutrich, I can&apos;t speak to that. However, he&apos;s included his thoughts and feelings about the PWM and refresh rate of Google&apos;s Super Actua Display below:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TnqSSfkMnpJQSSUAHUg3N3" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-pixel-8-pro-pixel-7-pro-displays1.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL next to Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel 7 Pro showing displays" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnqSSfkMnpJQSSUAHUg3N3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The ultra-low 240Hz PWM rate used to "dim" the phone&apos;s display gives me terrible headaches, especially when I try to use the phone in the evening. This problem started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone#:~:text=If%20you%27re%20suffering%20from,customer%20service%20team%20know%2C%20too.">about 2 years ago for me</a> and has only gotten worse as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">displays have gotten ultra-bright</a>.</p><p>The 3000-nit display on these phones is insanely bright, and flickering on and off at a low rate of 240Hz is nothing short of abysmal. Google is the only smartphone company that hasn&apos;t upgraded its rate — Samsung and Apple now use 480Hz on most devices — and companies like Honor and OnePlus push that rate to 2160Hz, 4320Hz, and beyond.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1008px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:172.42%;"><img id="Euf9ppPybGmybnjtG9p9hD" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pwm-measurement-100.jpg" alt="The PWM rate of the Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL at 100% brightness" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Euf9ppPybGmybnjtG9p9hD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1008" height="1738" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">It doesn't get any worse for your eyes than this display. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this brightness, Google is not even close to complying with the recommended <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1789/4479/">IEEE PAR 1789 standard</a> for displays and lighting.</p>

<p>Thanks to the onslaught of Pixel 9 leaks that we saw leading up to the official unveiling, my expectations about performance were quickly tempered. I was hoping that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> would end up putting Google&apos;s flagship phones alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> and iPhone, but it just wasn&apos;t meant to be.</p><p>That&apos;s not to say the G4 isn&apos;t performant, but it&apos;s still not quite on the same level as some of its competition. I&apos;m keeping my fingers crossed that this will change with the Tensor G5, but I digress.</p>

<p>In day-to-day usage, I came away quite impressed with how well the Pixel kept up with whatever I needed to do. There were times that I wanted to reach for either the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or Galaxy Z Fold 6, but that kind of defeats the purpose.</p>

<p>With practically every new device that I get, whether it&apos;s for review or for myself, I want to try and see how well it performs with emulation. This is one area where Google&apos;s Tensor chips just can&apos;t hold a candle to Qualcomm.</p><p>Using something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> for emulation is a dream, but that&apos;s largely because of the support for Snapdragon chips with Adreno GPUs. If you come across graphical glitches and errors, there&apos;s a good chance that you can find and use a different GPU driver, provided that your emulator is compatible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sJ2RxA4EU4ZBR5qQ9Npqk8" name="switch-emulation-pixel-9-pro-xl-2.jpg" alt="Switch Emulation on Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sJ2RxA4EU4ZBR5qQ9Npqk8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s not so much the case with MediaTek and Google&apos;s Tensor chips, which make use of Mali GPUs. However, I have noticed that community support for custom Mali drivers is beginning to increase. Nevertheless, it still hasn&apos;t resulted in stability and performance gains that can rival phones using a Snapdragon SoC.</p><p>The point that I&apos;m trying to make is that while I was able to load up a few Switch games, it&apos;s not an enjoyable experience. Framerates are unstable, constantly dropping as soon as you get to a graphically intensive area. And there are some games that just won&apos;t load at all, even if you manage to find a custom GPU driver.</p><p>In order to put this into better perspective, I defaulted to Geekbench 6, just to provide something a bit more substantive.</p>

<p>As you can see, the Pixel 9 Pro XL simply can&apos;t come close to competing with either the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 or Apple&apos;s A17 Pro. Mind you that isn&apos;t even Apple&apos;s latest chip, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-apple-or-google">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and Pro Max are powered by the A18 Pro. However, at the time of this review, I have yet to get my hands on the new iPhone, which is why it&apos;s not included in the table above.</p><p>While those numbers might seem a bit disappointing, it&apos;s not actually anything that you&apos;re going to notice on a daily basis. Potential issues and limitations won&apos;t crop up until you try and push the phone to the extremes. Which isn&apos;t something I suspect many people are doing on a regular basis. </p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JnfckBzVEHyPHreXakGZ2m" name="battery-settings-on-pixel-9-pro-xl.jpg" alt="Battery screen on Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JnfckBzVEHyPHreXakGZ2m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is what blew me away more than literally anything else about Google&apos;s latest phones. As it turns out, Google&apos;s inability to make the performance leap in the Tensor paid dividends in other ways, the largest of which seems to be battery life.</p><p>As I&apos;ve mentioned a few times, I took the Pixel 9 Pro XL with me on a trip to New York and figured it would be the best time to see how well it could hold up. Oh boy, it did so much better than I ever could have thought.</p><p>The first day kicked off at 6:30 a.m. and consisted of getting from my house to the airport, flying to the city, getting to the hotel, and then to an event, before coming back to the room shortly before midnight. Even with all of that, I still had yet to dip below 20% and I just couldn&apos;t believe it.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I'm constantly blown way with how long the Pixel 9 Pro XL lasts without needing to be recharged.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Across the entire three-day trip, I never once felt nervous or worried about running out of juice. That includes spending one day walking around New York City for the purpose of taking camera samples for this review. A day that ended with me taking a spur-of-the-moment trip to Yankee Stadium for the first time to see my beloved Orioles take on the Yankees.</p><p>Much like the Geekbench test results in the previous section, I&apos;m trying to provide something a bit more solid than just "battery is gud." With that being said, I opted for a good old video playback battery test. Here is how I had everything set up:</p>

<p>Then, I just fired up a 4K HDR video on YouTube and let it keep playing for the duration of the test. Below, you can see the battery percentages, which were recorded every hour at the same time:</p>

<p>After the first couple of hours, the trend became obvious, draining at a clip of 10% for four hours, and 9% in the last hour. This is after the 12% and 13% drop in the first two hours. It&apos;s almost like the phone kind of settled into a groove, so to speak, and was just coasting for as long as possible.</p><p>At that rate, the phone would have lasted for another three to four hours, running out of steam between 8:15 and 8:45. Of course, I could have gotten the 9 Pro XL to last much longer once Extreme Battery Saver mode kicked in.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It was weird seeing the rate of battery drain settle into a pattern. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Our parent company, Future PLC, runs lab tests via the Future Labs department and found that it took an average of 13 hours to run down the battery on the Pixel 9 Pro and the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Comparatively, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> died after just 9 hours of running the same test. Clearly, Google wasn&apos;t kidding when they said Tensor G4&apos;s efficiency was better.</p><p>I&apos;ve been using these phones for a few weeks now, and it&apos;s the first time in a long time that I haven&apos;t felt the need to enable the ability to see the battery percentage in the status bar.</p>
<p>In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 hands-on</a>, we talked about the new charging speeds for the phones and even was able to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-45w-usb-c-power-charger-snow/6587825.p?skuId=6587825">Google&apos;s new 45W charger</a>. While that charger is great for topping up the battery quickly from 0% to about 50% in under 30 minutes, a full charge isn&apos;t any faster than the Pixel 8 series — and charging the phone when it&apos;s above 50% battery level results in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-charging-speed">much slower charge</a> than you might expect.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-camera-2.jpg" alt="Camera app on Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ht5jhifqtAJ39edfQxtCwG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few things that I look for when it comes to testing out different phone cameras — speed, a telephoto lens, and how a photo looks without edits. Speed is definitely subjective, but if I try and take a picture of my dog before she gets distracted by something, that plays a role. So does being able to switch between the different modes without needing to do too much tinkering.</p><p>I feel like I&apos;m in the minority as someone who would much prefer having a telescope camera as opposed to an ultrawide one. But thankfully, the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have both, so it&apos;s not a concern.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-iphone-15-pro-max-3.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with iPhone 15 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fh74GxgsiaGa2xxK5wsmb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly is speed. There are times when I&apos;ll snap a bunch of RAW photos to manually edit them later. More often than not, I don&apos;t want to think twice about it, and just want my phone to take a good picture.</p><p>Thankfully, the Pixel 9 Pro and XL check all of these boxes. In fact, Google <em>probably</em> produces my favorite pictures out of any device that I own or have owned. This includes the iPhone and Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p>

<p>While my iPhone is still faster at taking regular JPG pictures, there&apos;s just something off about the color balance of my eyes.

<p>But there were times when Gemini would try to use Imagen to generate a picture itself, defeating the purpose of using Reimagine. I did find that either opening a new Gemini chat or reusing the initial prompt would give me what I was looking for.</p><p>It&apos;s great having this variety of options to enjoy the fruits of Gemini&apos;s labors. I suspect it will continue to improve, especially considering that Google is releasing updates on what appears to be a monthly cadence.</p><p>What I&apos;ve talked about doesn&apos;t even take into account the multimodality functionality of Gemini Nano. With the Pixel 9 series, Gemini Nano can now recognize text, voice, and image input. This is part of the reason why Google increased the RAM from 12GB to 16GB on the Pro models, as about 3GB of that is reserved for Gemini.</p>

<p>One thing that did come as a bit of a surprise was seeing that Google&apos;s latest devices didn&apos;t actually ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">the latest version of Android</a>. In years past, a new version of Android would be released, and then new phones would be introduced. This time, Google opted for something completely different, and I&apos;m not exactly sure how it will play out in the long run.</p><p>There&apos;s nothing to worry about when the last update will arrive, but it&apos;s still left me scratching my head. Perhaps this is just a "blip" on the radar, as rumors suggest Google could release <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-codename-sooner-launch-speculation">Android 16</a> in Q2 2025, as opposed to Q3 or Q4. Doing so would ensure that the new version of Android is ready in time for the next crop of Pixel phones.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-pro-the-competition"><span>Google Pixel 9 Pro: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UCWDgrL9gjjvGiK6EakeMh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-vs-OnePlus-12-back-02.jpg" alt="Comparing the OnePlus 12 to the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UCWDgrL9gjjvGiK6EakeMh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google&apos;s biggest competition in the U.S. is both Samsung and Apple, and both companies offer phones with faster processors and displays with better PWM rates. The Galaxy S24 series is promised to deliver the same seven years of software updates as the Pixel 9 series, and given the gulf in performance between Google and Samsung&apos;s phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">any Galaxy S24 model</a> will likely last longer without feeling sluggish like the Pixel 9 eventually will.</p><p>If you&apos;re looking for an even better display and crazy fast charging speeds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> does it all while costing even less than a Pixel 9 Pro. OnePlus only offers four years of software and OS updates, but you may not plan to hold on to your phone for more than that, so it&apos;s probably an OK trade-off. There&apos;s also the fact that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> are probably just a few months away.</p><p>Of course, none of these phones come with those nifty Pixel-exclusive features like call screening, VPN, Pixel Studio, and others. Plus, as I&apos;ve covered many times, Pixels take the best photos of kids and pets and now even have great features like Add Me that offer even more interesting photography options. And, unlike Samsung or OnePlus, The Pixel 9 Pro family gives you a choice of phone size without losing features or camera prowess.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-9-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>Google Pixel 9 Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ppx2XnXUjksHgLDqz4RePJ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-10.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ppx2XnXUjksHgLDqz4RePJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You have pets or kids that you take lots of pictures of.</li><li>You love Google's clever AI features and Pixel exclusives like call screening.</li><li>You like to keep your phones for years before updating.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You should not buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You play lots of mobile games.</li><li>You want faster charging or more storage at a lower price.</li><li>You're sensitive to light flicker or displays that use low-Hz PWM dimming.</li></ul>
<p>Over the years, Google has figured out clever ways to differentiate its Pixel line from other phones in meaningful ways. Pixel-exclusive features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-call-screen-feature-pixel">Call Screening</a>, advanced spam detection, and Pixel VPN have been mainstays of the line for years, while new Pixel-exclusive features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a>, and camera modes like Add Me are sure to make your friends and family jealous.</p><p>However, there&apos;s an underlying upfront value problem that continues to grow. Pixel is once again $100 more than the previous year. Tensor is still slower than other competing processors and heats up more quickly than those, too. Google hasn&apos;t improved its display dimming rate as other companies have, and the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is problematic for some people, too.</p><p>Thankfully, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9-deals-pixel-9-pro-discounts">Pixel 9 deals</a> will often get you the phone for next to nothing as Google tries to expand its reach globally and get more Pixels into more people&apos;s hands. It doesn&apos;t make up for some of the other problems the phone has, but it&apos;s easy to give Pixel a shot and see if all those amazing exclusive features and apps are more important to you than raw performance or charging speed. Plus, being able to choose a size without losing important features is finally a reality.</p>

<p>The Galaxy S10 Ultra is a modest upgrade over its predecessor, and other than an anti-reflective coating, it has the same 14.6-inch AMOLED panel as last year. The switch to MediaTek hardware is interesting, and it holds up against the best that Qualcomm has to offer. You also get Galaxy AI and long-term software updates, and plenty of custom software features designed to maximize the real estate. That said, the tablet is being sold at a hefty premium, and if you want to get a decent value, you should consider picking up another Android tablet instead.</p></p>

                    <p><p>A fantastic value</p>
<p>The OnePlus Pad 2 is my favorite Android tablet; it doesn't have an AMOLED panel, but the IPS LCD screen is terrific in its own right, and it holds up incredibly well for consuming content. The hardware is top-notch, you get good battery life with 67W charging tech, and the software has plenty of useful extras. Coming in at less than half the price of the Tab S10 Ultra, this is the obvious choice if you need a new tablet.</p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-empty-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra - Empty Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like the internal hardware itself, Samsung didn&apos;t make many changes to the external design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>, and the tablet looks nearly identical to its predecessor. That means you get flat sides and rounded edges, and I don&apos;t really like the design. The flat sides make it uncomfortable to hold and use the tablet, and you&apos;ll need to use it with a case, adding to the heft and weight.</p><p>The tablet has an aluminum mid-frame along with an aluminum back, and it uses the same alloy as the Galaxy S24 Ultra, giving it a decent amount of rigidity. Samsung continues to deliver IP68 dust and water resistance on the tablet, and that is a major differentiator.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tjMMRAY28X3My6QE4LDUWa" name="oneplus-pad-2-5.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 back view highlighting metal chassis" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tjMMRAY28X3My6QE4LDUWa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-is-my-favorite-android-tablet">OnePlus Pad 2</a>, meanwhile, has a much better design with flowing sides and edges, and it is significantly easier to handle. It doesn&apos;t have ingress protection and is sold in a single color option, but it has a sturdy aluminum chassis, and I don&apos;t have any issues with the build quality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VufeKJJPRoheUGJwAPGQWW" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hdr-video-playback.jpg" alt="HDR video playback on Galaxy AI key on Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VufeKJJPRoheUGJwAPGQWW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming in at 718g, the Tab S10 Ultra is one of the heaviest Android tablets around, and a major contributing factor is the 14.6-inch panel. Samsung is using the same AMOLED panel as last year, but the tablet now gets an anti-reflective coating, and that&apos;s good to see. The panel itself is among the best you&apos;ll find on any tablet today — only the iPad Pro 13 has a better OLED screen.</p><p>The gargantuan AMOLED panel has outstanding color vibrancy, and is a delight to use. The Pad 2 misses out on OLED tech, and instead uses a 12.1-inch IPS LCD panel that goes up to 144Hz. While it doesn&apos;t have the same great contrast or color accuracy, it gets bright in daily use, and holds up incredibly well for streaming content. HDR content in particular shines on the tablet, and Dolby Vision integration is an added bonus.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-in-hand.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra using Generative Edit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, Samsung sided with MediaTek with this generation, and the Tab S10 Ultra is powered by the Dimensity 9300+. While I don&apos;t have the tablet on hand yet, I tested the Dimensity 9300+ in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">Xiaomi 14T Pro review</a>, and the key takeaway is that it is better than Qualcomm&apos;s offering at multi-core workloads.</p><p>That&apos;s because MediaTek is using Cortex X4 cores instead of the usual A720 cores to do a bulk of the heavy lifting, and it gives the Dimensity 9300+ a slender edge. Qualcomm still has the lead when it comes to the GPU, but what&apos;s clear is that MediaTek is intent on bridging that division.</p>

<p>Coming back to the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, there shouldn&apos;t be any issues with the hardware itself in daily use, but again, I&apos;ll confirm that once I actually test the tablet. Thankfully, I used the OnePlus Pad 2 for the better part of a month, and I didn&apos;t run into any issues whatsoever. The Pad 2 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, and it is a powerhouse; it handles demanding games with ease, and there are zero slowdowns in regular use.</p><p>Overheating isn&apos;t an issue on the Pad 2 either, and it is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> you can get at the moment. The only major omission is cellular connectivity — OnePlus still doesn&apos;t have a cellular model, and you can&apos;t add a SIM card to the Pad 2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KyVBAL4fUyTDpxsCdBuErZ" name="oneplus-pad-2-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Pad 2 with keyboard accessory next to it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KyVBAL4fUyTDpxsCdBuErZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both tablets have 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage as standard, and the Tab S10 Ultra is configurable with up to 1TB of storage. The Pad 2 is available in a single variant, and it doesn&apos;t have a MicroSD slot, a standard feature on Samsung&apos;s tablet.</p><p>The Tab S10 Ultra also has a larger 11200mAh battery, but it still relies on 45W charging. The Pad 2 has a 9510mAh battery, and the 67W charging tech does a better job in this regard. The Pad 2 has standout battery life, and this hasn&apos;t been an issue at all in the month I used it.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="phRqnQkmNTVPVsnZu7jLea" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-sketch-to-image-tree-2.jpg" alt="Sketch to Image results on Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/phRqnQkmNTVPVsnZu7jLea.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has a clear edge on the software front thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and all the custom features it added to its tablets over the years. DeX is another major differentiator, and you don&apos;t quite get the same feature on any other manufacturer&apos;s tablets. With Galaxy AI, you get a similar feature-set as Samsung&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a>, including AI Note Assist, Sketch to Image, real-time translation, and much more.</p><p>Another advantage to the Tab S10 Ultra is long-term updates; it will pick up the same seven Android OS updates as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">S24 Ultra</a>, and that&apos;s great to see. Samsung doesn&apos;t quite delver software updates to its tablets at the same time as phones, but the fact that you get updates all the way through 2031 is a huge deal.</p><p>OnePlus is also doing better on the software side of things, but the Pad 2 doesn&apos;t have much in the way of AI-assisted features. What I like is the unique multitasking mode, and the software finally has useful extras that take advantage of the 12.1-inch panel. The Pad 2 won&apos;t get as many software updates as the Tab S10 Ultra, but it will pick up four Android OS updates.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is retailing for a hefty $1,199, with the OnePlus Pad 2 available at a much more reasonable $549. Yes, the Tab S10 Ultra has a larger screen and uses AMOLED tech, and that gives it much better color vibrancy. You also get IP68 ingress protection, all the AI features that Samsung offers on the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and the same software update guarantee.</p><p>But is that worth twice the asking price of the Pad 2? No — it just isn&apos;t. If you need an Android tablet with powerful hardware that&apos;s designed for consuming content and playing games, the Pad 2 is a terrific choice. While it doesn&apos;t have an AMOLED panel, the LCD screen is plenty great in its own right, and it even has Dolby Vision integration.</p><p>If you don&apos;t care about the asking price and want an Android tablet with a vibrant AMOLED panel, then the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is the way to go. But if you&apos;re looking to maximize value and need something that&apos;s almost as good — but costs less than half as much — I recommend picking up the OnePlus Pad 2.</p>

<p>OPPO has been drip-feeding hints about its upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>, and now a company executive reveals that the devices can get rid of annoying reflections in your photos.</p><p>OPPO&apos;s Find series product manager, Zhou Yibao, shared on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/OzPyD5dOI" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that the Find X8 series will feature reflection removal for your photos, and unsurprisingly, it&apos;s all powered by AI (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_find_x8_series_will_remove_reflections_from_your_pictures-news-64783.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>In a demo, Zhou highlighted a cultural artifact from the Chengdu Museum in China. While the original photo looked great, it had a noticeable reflection on the artifact&apos;s surface that distracted from its beauty.</p><p>But once the AI imaging feature was applied, the reflection vanished, leaving behind a clean, crystal-clear image.</p><p>To further show off how well this new feature works, Zhou asked his social media followers to post pictures with reflections. He then demonstrated how the device effortlessly gets rid of those pesky elements, as you can see in the visuals he shared.</p>

<p>Zhou explained that this feature is made for those moments when reflections and glare mess up your photos. Think of times like capturing an aerial view through a plane window or pretty views while riding a train.</p><p>Although reflection removal tech isn’t brand new, it started getting noticed when Huawei showcased it back in 2020. It wasn’t until Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-object-eraser-can-now-automatically-erase-shadows-and-reflections">added this feature to its S22 series</a>, though, that it really took off and caught everyone’s attention.</p><p>Still, it’s a fantastic addition to the Find X8 series, letting you nail that perfect shot through airplane windows or office glass.</p><p>Now that OPPO is embracing a reflection removal feature, you can bet other Chinese smartphone brands will hop on the train and add it to their lineups, too.</p><p>On top of that, the Find X8 series is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-and-x8-pro-specs-leak">gearing up for some impressive hardware upgrades</a>, featuring a 10x periscope camera that outdoes the 6x zoom from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>. Plus, the rear camera module is expected to have a unique square design with rounded edges.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube detailed what's coming up for Shorts, beginning with an option to record three-minute-long videos.</li><li>Shorts will soon display a "template" icon, so creators can quickly hop on the latest trends with their unique touch.</li><li>Other Shorts updates include customization for the Home feed, community engagement, and Veo's AI assistance for "later this year."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>October is looking like the month for Shorts as YouTube details what&apos;s coming up for its short-form content.</p><p>YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/tall-updates-coming-to-shorts/">highlighted several updates</a> arriving for Shorts later this month, beginning with longer videos. Starting on October 15, content creators can craft Shorts up to 3 minutes long. This longer duration for Shorts pertains to videos that feature a square "or taller" aspect ratio.</p><p>It&apos;s worth remembering that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-takes-aim-at-tiktok-with-these-new-reels-features">Instagram&apos;s Reels</a> can reach a maximum of 90 seconds (a minute and a half), so YouTube will have that beat by 30 seconds. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/using-tiktok/creating-videos/camera-tools#:~:text=Videos%20you%20record%20in%20TikTok%20can%20be%20up%20to%2010%20minutes%20long.">TikTok lets its users</a> record 10-minute-long videos in the app<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>YouTube&apos;s Shorts update also includes new templates. The post states users can find templates after tapping "Remix" on a Short they enjoy. "Use this template" will let you take a trend or a sound clip and use that in your creation.</p><p>Speaking of following trends, YouTube teases that there&apos;s more in store for "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-remix-music-video-rollout">Remix</a>" regarding videos and music videos from the platform. "In the coming months," the post states creators can pull "multiple clips" from a variety of sources across YouTube and plug them into a single Short.</p><p>Customization is preparing to hit YouTube&apos;s primary home feed on mobile. Shorts are everywhere, and often in these two-by-two boxes. The platform states it will introduce a "Show fewer Shorts" option inside the three-dot menu of a Shorts suggestion box.</p><p>Be advised: YouTube states it will show fewer Shorts "temporarily" on your Home feed if you hit that option.</p><p>The company is also looking to drive more engagement between communities and the activities that trend via Shorts. According to the post, pausing a Short will display a new option in the top row called "Trends." This opens a dedicated Shorts Trending page, where users can find what&apos;s new and catching viewers&apos; attention.</p><p>Additionally, Google is adding a comment section preview in the Shorts feed, showing how others feel about a Short without having to open the section.</p>

<p>Today&apos;s post reiterated an announcement during September&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/made-by-youtube-2024-ai-hype-updates">Made by YouTube event</a> involving Google&apos;s AI model Veo. The AI software is a video-generation model featuring an "advanced understanding of natural language and visual semantics." YouTube stated Veo&apos;s inclusion on the platform would come to the benefit of Shorts.</p><p>Now, the company states Veo will arrive "later this year" with its AI generation tools. Such options will let users create backgrounds and produce unique concepts that might&apos;ve been far too difficult without Veo&apos;s assistance. However, it&apos;s worth noting that any usage of Veo will result in a "generated with AI" content label on your Short.</p>
