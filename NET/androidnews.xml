<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>OpenAI just launched Deep Research for ChatGPT, a fast AI tool that cranks out detailed research reports in minutes instead of hours.</li><li>Deep Research mimics a human analyst, scouring and blending online sources for well-rounded reports.</li><li>It’s available for ChatGPT Pro users at $200 a month, with a limit of 100 queries per month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OpenAI has unveiled a new AI agent for ChatGPT that cranks out detailed research reports in no time. Think of it as your fast pass to pro-level insights, removing the need to wait around for ages to get the info you need.</p><p>OpenAI’s Deep Research is designed to take on tough research tasks by diving into multi-step investigations across the web. It slashes the time needed for deep research, pulling off in minutes what used to take hours of manual work (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/openai-chatgpt-deep-research-3522437/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>Mimicking the careful process of a human analyst, it scours, sorts, and blends tons of online sources to spit out detailed, well-rounded reports, according to OpenAI's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p><p>Once you give Deep Research a solid prompt and iron out a few quick details, it gets to work on its own, crunching data behind the scenes. While it might take anywhere from five to 30 minutes to finish, OpenAI says this smart system can smash through hours of human research in just a fraction of the time.</p><p>With rivals, especially Chinese companies like DeepSeek, heating up the race, OpenAI’s launch of Deep Research is a big leap forward in building smarter, more independent AI tools.</p><p>Built on OpenAI’s upcoming o3 model, Deep Research is designed for professionals who need solid, in-depth insights. Whether you're in finance, science, policy, or engineering, this tool helps tackle heavy research with accuracy and reliability.</p><p>This AI agent works on its own, mapping out and executing multi-step research while staying flexible enough to backtrack and adapt to real-time info when needed.</p><p>Rather than solely producing text, this AI lays out its whole research process in a sidebar—citations, methodology, and all—so you see exactly how it got there.</p><p>Deep Research looks ready to shake up knowledge work, bringing big benefits to its users. The features it offers seem pretty similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>'s Deep Research too.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-feature-expands-to-more-languages-and-regions">rolled out its own version last year for subscribers</a>, aiming to cut research time down to minutes instead of hours. OpenAI's Deep Research seems to be chasing the same goal.</p><p>Deep Research is currently available on the web for ChatGPT Pro subscribers, costing $200 a month, with a cap of 100 queries per month.</p>

<p>Samsung's latest plus-sized flagship is here, and the Galaxy S25 Plus stacks up nicely with the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Of course, the comparisons between Pixel and Galaxy phones aren't always equal. While both the Pixel 9 and Galaxy S25 lineups each include three models, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is comparable to both the midsize Galaxy S25 Plus and the top-tier Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>At $999, the 6.7-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</a> is a tough competitor for the $1,099 6.8-inch Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, which is the reigning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">top Android phone</a>. The Galaxy S25 Plus has the better processor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> has the better camera, and both have excellent software.</p><p>So, which one should you buy? That's what this comparison will help you find out, so let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dp9bHgC6vobevWKL4d3TrV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Google-Pixel-9-Pro-XL-display-home-screen-01" alt="Comparing the display and home screens of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus versus the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dp9bHgC6vobevWKL4d3TrV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's only a tenth of an inch separating the Galaxy S25 Plus and the Pixel 9 Pro XL in terms of screen sizes, but you wouldn't know it from their overall form factor. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is thinner, lighter, and more compact than the Pixel 9 Pro XL — and significantly so. For instance, the former weighs just 190 grams, while the latter weighs 221 grams. The Pixel is also more than a full millimeter thicker than the Galaxy.</p><p>Put simply, you will notice and feel the size difference between these two phones. If you prefer a more compact handset, you'll like the Galaxy S25 Plus, which measures 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm. Those who like the hefty and large feel of a premium flagship might prefer the Pixel 9 Pro XL, measuring 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm.</p><p>Both designs follow industry trends, now preferring largely rectangular chassis with slight chamfers rather than curvy shells. Both phones also feature matte back glass finishes, but the Pixel 9 Pro XL has polished sides while the Galaxy S25 Plus has matte aluminum rails.</p>

<p>From the back, the iconic Pixel camera housing is hard to miss on the Pixel 9 Pro XL. It's pill-shaped and is kind of a dust and lint magnet, especially if you use your phone caseless. The rear lenses on the Galaxy S25 Plus are separate and now feature DSLR-style lens covers that differentiate it and older models.</p><p>In terms of the display, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has the larger 6.8-inch AMOLED panel. It's equipped with 120Hz support and variable refresh rate capabilities, just like the Galaxy S25 Plus. The Galaxy S25 Plus is smaller, with a 6.7-inch AMOLED, and includes a ProScaler that uses software to make the Galaxy's display look sharper. Both phones are covered by Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on top of their screens.</p>

<p>There are advantages to both the Galaxy S25 Plus and the Pixel 9 Pro XL's respective approaches to hardware. Samsung went with raw power in the Galaxy S25 Plus, since it's powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> chipset and paired with 12GB of RAM. The collaborative chip between Samsung and Qualcomm is the most powerful Android processor to date, beating even the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite platform.</p><p>Regardless of which benchmark you pick, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> in the Pixel 9 Pro XL will lose to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>. However, Google is optimizing everything in the Pixel 9 Pro XL, from the silicon to the display and software. That gives it an edge in efficiency. Unfortunately, Google lost its lead in AI processing — the Tensor G4 chip can only handle 45 tokens per second for AI tasks, while the Snapdragon 8 Elite can do 70 tokens per second.</p><p>Both phones are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based, and both come with a promise of seven years of OS upgrades. Samsung uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, which is unique but is more similar to Google's build of Android than ever. Pixel Launcher is truly Google's vision for Android, and it lacks some of Samsung's unnecessary bloat.</p>

<p>Samsung and Google both upgraded the connectivity offerings on their newest flagships. Both are equipped with Wi-Fi 7, mmWave 5G, NFC, and UWB support. The Galaxy S25 Plus has the edge in Bluetooth connectivity, with 5.4 as opposed to 5.3 for the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro XL: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tYC9X6Lo2GHhMqWT4oUQnV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Google-Pixel-9-Pro-XL-back-corners-01" alt="Comparing the size and shape of the camera islands of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus versus the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tYC9X6Lo2GHhMqWT4oUQnV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It feels like the same story every year for Galaxy flagships: the camera system is holding the Galaxy S25 Plus back. It uses the same sensors as the Galaxy S24 Plus, Galaxy S23 Plus, and Galaxy S24 Plus. The lack of upgrades here is astounding, and it only helps the Pixel 9 Pro XL's case. To recap, the Galaxy S25 Plus includes the following sensors: a 50MP main, a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide.</p><p>Basically, all Google had to do over the last few years of Pixel development is keep making upgrades, and it has. The Pixel 9 Pro XL has a great camera system with a 50MP main shooter and dual 48MP secondary cameras. There's a 48MP ultrawide and another 48MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom support. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is a better fit to compete with the Galaxy S25 Ultra than the Galaxy S25 Plus, despite it only costing $100 more than the latter.</p><p>Google wins the front camera battle, too, since the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 48MP front-facing, hole-punch sensor. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Plus has a 12MP front sensor.</p>

<p>This is a rare case of two phones that both have excellent value propositions, each for a different type of smartphone user. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is thinner, lighter, and more compact than the Pixel 9 Pro XL, so it's ideal for those who want a small phone without sacrificing too many features. The camera system could be better, but the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is standout.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a superior camera system with excellent computational photography. The phone's 6.8-inch screen may be the perfect middle ground between the Galaxy S25 Plus and the massive Galaxy S25 Ultra. Of course, it has Google AI at the core and the Pixel Launcher, so the software is excellent.</p><p>All told, you can't really go wrong with either of these phones. However, considering how similar the Galaxy S25 Plus is to the Galaxy S24 Plus, you may want to check if the predecessor could give you what you're looking for on a budget. We have that comparison for you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-galaxy-s24-plus">here</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Pixel phones, along with other Android phones, have incorporated a Wi-Fi calling feature for over a couple of years now. It works in conjunction with the device's carrier to ensure users have a smoother calling experience. Pixel phones, however, may soon remind users to enable the feature if it is not enabled already.</p><p>The feature was spotted in an APK teardown performed by folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-phones-remind-wi-fi-calling-apk-teardown-3521529/">Android Authority</a> for the Adaptive Connectivity Services app bearing version <strong>p.2025.01</strong>. Based on identified strings in the app's backend, Google could soon notify Pixel owners to enable Wi-Fi calling.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="g2p3qwKfPnzfPZKFZVCKf" name="pixel-3a-wifi-calling.jpg" alt="Wi-Fi calling on an Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g2p3qwKfPnzfPZKFZVCKf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The notification description further reads, "Turn on Wi-Fi calling to talk and text in places where the mobile network isn't as strong." The publication further notes that it is still unclear whether Google would send users the notification only when Wi-Fi calling is disabled or when it detects that the user is in a poor or no network area. Either way, users will soon see a "turn on" pop-up with the new notification and also can "dismiss" it.</p><p>Users who are new to Pixel phones and not so tech-savvy might find the new notification quite useful. However, not all Pixel phones in all regions support the Wi-Fi calling feature, since it is highly dependent on the respective carriers and Google itself; that's one thing to keep in mind.</p><p>If you own a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> series phone or any other Pixel phone that supports the Wi-Fi calling feature, it could soon come to your handset via the aforementioned app update, which could be in a couple of weeks or months, as it still appears to be in the testing phase. We recommend you stay up to date with the Adaptive Connectivity Services app version to notice the new, nifty notification feature.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It's easy to think that the best phones in 2025 are growing stale. The product category has matured over the past two decades, and many updates are incremental. For instance, the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> looks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 lineup</a> with a few tweaks. Similar things can be said about the latest iPhones and newest Pixels, to a lesser degree.</p><p>In fact, Android Central's resident phone expert, Nicholas Sutrich, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/north-american-smartphone-market-2025-predictions-expectations" target="_blank">previewed the market for smartphones in 2025</a> at the end of last year with an outlook that could be described as depressing. He's right. For most phone buyers in North America, this year will be just like the last one — filled with incremental updates, rising prices, and little variety.</p>

<p>Here's the thing: it doesn't have to be this way. Smartphone buyers in the U.S. specifically silo themselves when buying their handsets, often sticking to a handful of mobile carriers and even fewer phone brands. It's a phenomenon that seems to only exist in North America.</p><p>Put simply, buying smartphones through carrier contracts is a bad idea. It limits your options, restricts your flexibility, and can end up costing you more in the long run. It's easy to see how.</p><p>Samsung routinely offers boosted trade-in values for phones, but you can't take advantage of them unless your phone is paid off. Want to pay your phone off early to maximize your trade-in value? You'll likely lose all the discounts and promotions you got when you bought your current phone from your carrier.</p><p>A similar situation occurs if you break your phone and don't have insurance. Say your phone is too damaged to fix and you need a new one — you could be hit with a massive bill that includes the amount needed to pay off your current phone, plus the price of a new one and any carrier fees that apply.</p><p>Those are just a few reasons that you might want to consider buying a phone outright in 2025 rather than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/should-you-buy-phone-carrier">purchasing it from a mobile network provider</a> — like AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon. But there are other reasons, like the availability of more phone brands and models beyond what you see in your carrier stores. Based on what I've seen from the phone market in late 2024 and early 2025, there are lots of exciting and fun smartphones available if you look beyond the restrictions imposed by carriers.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R are two great phones to start with because they're sensible options. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> is a $900 phone with hardware that can match or beat the $1,299 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which is pretty exciting to me. On top of that, the phone has IP68 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 protection</a> against dust and water ingress. In other words, you can stick the OnePlus 13 in a dishwasher, and it should survive (though we don't recommend you try it).</p><p>The OnePlus 13 isn't the only phone in 2025 that can survive a dishwasher run. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> is dishwasher-safe as well, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-phone-makers-want-your-smartphone-to-survive-a-kitchen-nightmare">I saw it used as a cutting board, too</a>. If that isn't fun, I honestly don't know what is.</p><p>Back to the <em>sensible</em> nature of this section, it's hard to forget the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>. It delivers flagship specs for $600, and that's downright cool. I think there are many people in North America that have been conditioned by Apple and Samsung to think that flagships have to cost $1,000 or above. In 2025, that couldn't be more wrong. There has never been a time when $500 or $600 could get you more in a smartphone.</p><p>As a phone reviewer, I often test out a variety of review units each year. But I also buy way too many phones and other gadgets with my own money, and I've never been more conflicted about which one to buy. The OnePlus 13 is the sensible option, like I said, although there are many others that fit the "fun" bill better.</p>

<p>One of those devices is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro</a>. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-is-the-best-gaming-phone-and-its-here-in-the-us">came to the U.S. in January</a> and is simply a beastly and unique gaming phone. The ROG Phone 9 Pro has a loud design with nods to ASUS' gaming aesthetic, but things really get crazy with "Anime Vision." That's what ASUS calls the LED display on the back of ROG Phone 9 Pro, which includes 648 individual white and red LEDs.</p><p>You can put logos, text, and other designs on the back of your smartphone with the ROG Phone 9 Pro. If you're not impressed yet, the ROG Phone 9 Pro's back LED display can actually be used to play retro-style mini-games and show your phone's battery percentage. From a hardware perspective, the ROG Phone 9 Pro has a 3.5mm headphone jack and <em>two</em> USB-C ports designed to connect to accessories like controllers or a cooling fan.</p><p>Seriously, anyone who thinks phones aren't fun nowadays isn't looking hard enough. The ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro is one of the most fun devices I've ever seen, and I might pay over $1,000 just to get my hands on one.</p>

<p>Finally, I think it's worth emphasizing how much flair and customization can be added to phones, especially those sold outside the U.S. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-spark-30-bumblebee-edition-hands-on">TECNO Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition</a> is designed like a Transformer, which is insanely cool for robot nerds like myself. If superheroes are more your style, there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-is-the-poco-x7-pro-iron-man-edition">Poco X7 Pro Iron Man edition</a>, which needs no introduction.</p><p>No matter what kind of smartphone buyer you are, there's a "fun" device for you in 2025. Like a super durable smartphone? The OnePlus 13 is right for you. Need a flagship on a budget? Don't count out the OnePlus 13R. Want a phone so cool it gets into ludicrous hardware territory? That's the ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro, plain and simple. Want to express your fandoms without a case or skin? The Bumblebee or Iron Man phones are insanely neat.</p><p>It's true that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> from brands like Samsung or Google can get boring. However, it would be a mistake to limit yourself to those companies or to whatever your cellular carrier offers. There's a whole lot of phones out there, and they're more fun than ever.</p>

<p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 series will likely be delivered to users starting February 3 for those who've pre-ordered. This means more reviews are likely to surface about the trio, including the Galaxy S25 Ultra. While we await, JerryRigEverything's durability test is now out, showcasing the build and some cons of the Ultra handset.</p><p>YouTuber Zack Nelson begins his latest durability test video by discussing how companies like Apple and Samsung are sticking to the Titanium builds that their phones have incorporated over the past couple of years; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> features the same and looks better than before.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kN9YYURZD5Q" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Later in the video, when the handset is compared to its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">S24 Ultra</a>, it is evident how familiar both flagships look, except for the slightly rounded corners that the Galaxy S25 Ultra features.</p><p>Nelson further examines the new S-Pen, now downgraded with the removal of low-power Bluetooth functionality — used for gestures and its button, which was previously utilized as a click button to take photos with the handset's cameras.</p><p>Since the S-Pen doesn't require an inbuilt battery with the omission of the aforementioned features, it still has a battery slot, which can be seen in the video as Nelson snaps it into pieces.</p>
<p>Turning to the Galaxy S25 Ultra's screen, the Corning Gorilla Glass Armor 2 protection adequately protects it from scratches, as the most visible ones are seen in level 7 of Nelson's scratch test.</p><p>Moving to the controversial aspect of the device, its camera rings are fixed with some kind of glue on top of the lenses, which is visible in the durability test video. Nelson manages to remove the metal rings, which appear to serve only aesthetic purposes for the Galaxy S25 Ultra's design.</p><p>Additionally, those rings are slightly elevated on the rear panel, which means they can easily accumulate dust underneath, and cleaning them often would be a nightmare. Lastly, the popular bend test has also been performed by Nelson; the S25 Ultra seems to have passed the test with flying colors.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the weekend, we learned that Apple reportedly canceled plans to make a pair of AR glasses that would operate by connecting to a Mac computer. The glasses were seen as a sort of "Apple Vision Lite," as they were powered by the same operating system inside the expensive Apple Vision Pro mixed reality headset.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/apple-scraps-work-on-mac-connected-augmented-reality-glasses">Bloomberg</a>'s original report noted that executives weren't impressed with the product, citing performance issues and ever-changing feature requests. These glasses originally required pairing to an iPhone, but that was later changed to a Mac as they drained the phone's battery too fast and required too much processing power for a phone.</p><p>The news comes on the one-year anniversary of the Apple Vision Pro, a product that has been met with waning consumer interest given the extremely high $3,500 price tag. Given Apple's woes with XR products — XR is the umbrella term for anything AR, VR, and beyond — critics are saying that this is yet another death knell for the category as a whole. As usual, though, they couldn't be more wrong.</p>

<p>I'm writing this article from my laptop while wearing a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-spatial-ar-glasses-announced">Xreal One</a> glasses. I'm not using my laptop's display because I'm at my kitchen table, a place that's not ergonomically designed to work from. Unless I want severe neck pain by the end of the day, wearing my Xreal One glasses and working from a giant virtual screen is the best preventative medicine.</p><p>Apple realized this was the best possible scenario for a smart display glasses product after its initial R&D attempts on a phone. I don't buy for a minute that a phone "wasn't powerful enough" to run this experience. Today's smartphones are powered by what are essentially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">laptop-grade processors</a>. Maybe the phone's battery life was an issue, but even that seems questionable.</p><p>Rather, I think Apple understood that having a phone in your hand connected to a pair of smart display glasses simply doesn't make any sense. There are very few scenarios I can think of where connecting smart glasses to a phone is an ideal experience. Gaming and watching videos are brilliant when viewing from a pair of smart glasses, and your neck and back will thank you for not holding a phone up for hours.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ku2fbtdqn3a44ENUri6gyT" name="xreal-one-vs-xreal-air-2-side" alt="Xreal Air 2 (left) vs Xreal One (right) from a side perspective" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ku2fbtdqn3a44ENUri6gyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also think the company struggled to differentiate these glasses from existing products. It's possible that they were sleeker than existing smart display glasses, but is that enough, especially given that a Mac was a requirement for use? Probably not.</p><p>Even many of Apple's described glasses features sounded similar to existing Xreal One and Viture Pro glasses. They reportedly didn't have the EyeSight feature from Vision Pro — that's the outer display that shows your eyes to people in the room — but the glasses were said to have an electrochromic film on the glasses that could change the tint to show your actual eyes or cover them up to let others around you know that you're busy.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Apple likely struggled to differentiate this product from the pack without significant technological hurdles.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The question is why Apple didn't feel content with shipping a high-quality wearable display, which is how current smart display glasses could be described. The Xreal One glasses I'm wearing right now are the first pair Xreal has shipped with custom silicon inside, but even still, the company isn't trying to sell these as competition to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>.</p><p>One of the biggest reasons to wear an Apple Vision Pro is to have a studio-quality set of virtual monitors no matter where you're working from, and I'm genuinely surprised Apple didn't try to just replicate this one proven feature in a smart glasses form factor.</p><p>Without Apple coming forward and saying it, I think the glasses didn't deliver a wide enough field of view (FoV) to properly replicate the Vision Pro's virtual monitor experience. Xreal One currently sports the widest FoV of any smart display glasses at 50 degrees. Xreal One Pro ups this to 57 degrees and is slated to launch soon. Both of these are notably wider than the closest competition but still fall short of Meta Orion's 70-degree FoV and Vision Pro's 90 degrees.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Existing smart display glasses have become increasingly excellent, and it's surprising Apple didn't at least go for the "premium wearable display" angle.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>What's particularly interesting to me here is that Apple was apparently trying to run Vision OS on these glasses. If they required a Mac to function, I'm not entirely sure what Apple was trying to do by including a full-fledged OS on a pair of tethered glasses.</p><p>The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> operating system is being used to power headsets like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung Project Moohan,</a> as well as smart glasses from Xreal, Magic Leap, and potentially other companies. That means both Vision OS and Android XR are capable of being scaled to very different types of products, but neither company has shown off exactly what this means.</p><p>Apple absolutely should try to at least ship a pair of glasses that function as a wearable display, if for no other reason than to save its users' necks while they travel or are away from their desks. Until then, pick up a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4">Viture Pro</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XREAL-Glasses-Renowned-Adjustable-Transparency/dp/B0DNFFXG65/">Xreal One</a> glasses from Amazon. Your neck will thank you.</p>

That open-ended flexibility became their driving force to push the watch’s limits.</p><p>However, when the usual methods of sideloading APKs—like Bluetooth or browser installs—didn’t work, ZenonDesingk had to step up. They turned to ADB and the Bugjaeger app, using Wi-Fi to transfer the needed APK files from their phone to the smartwatch.</p><p>Once the PSP emulator was installed and the DPI settings were fine-tuned, they brought some serious gaming action to the Galaxy Watch 5. Classics like GTA, Mortal Kombat, and Need for Speed: Most Wanted ran buttery smooth at around 60 FPS, while heavier titles like God of War still managed a solid 30 FPS.</p>

<p>Even though the Galaxy Watch 5 is a three-year-old device and not exactly the latest tech, it’s still holding its own—running emulated PSP games at a smooth 60 FPS. It’s a solid reminder of how capable its hardware still is, even by today’s standards.</p><p>Knowing touchscreen controls could only go so far, ZenonDesingk hooked up a Bluetooth gamepad to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>, making gameplay way more comfortable and accurate. With that hurdle out of the way, the only real limit left was the watch’s performance. And thanks to a bunch of emulators and the option to sideload Android games, the little smartwatch suddenly became a surprisingly versatile gaming machine.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung might soon let you turn off that annoying screen dimming at 5% battery with the One UI 7 update.</li><li>Right now, your Galaxy phone dims the screen when it hits 5%, making it hard to see, even in good lighting.</li><li>The latest One UI 7 beta introduces a new "Auto dim screen" toggle in settings, giving users the option to turn off the auto-dim feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung might finally let you take charge of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>'s annoying screen dimming feature that kicks in when it hits 5% battery. Word is, the upcoming One UI 7 update could give you the option to turn it off.</p><p>Currently, One UI goes full-on power-saving mode when your battery hits 5%, slashing your screen brightness to the point where it’s almost impossible to see, even in decent lighting.</p><p>Sure, dialing down screen brightness can help squeeze more juice out of your battery, but it really should be up to you, not your phone. Right now, Galaxy devices take matters into their own hands, automatically dimming the screen when the battery is running on fumes. Sure, you can crank the brightness back up, but having your phone override your settings like that is super annoying.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-one-ui-7-auto-dim-screen-low-battery-feature/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>, the new One UI 7 beta address this annoyance. This means you're getting the choice to stop your screen from going dim when your battery hits 5%.</p><p>In the Battery settings, there’s a fresh toggle called "Auto dim screen" that lets you turn off the automatic brightness drop.</p>

<p>This update might seem like a small change, but it’s actually pretty meaningful. For starters, it’s all about giving users more control over how their phone works. Letting people customize their device’s behavior is a win, and Samsung deserves some credit for finally giving Galaxy owners the option to ditch that auto-dimming hassle.</p><p>Sure, automatically dimming the screen to save battery makes sense, but it can also make your phone way harder to use when you need it most. Letting users decide how to handle that trade-off is a smart move.</p><p>One UI 7 is officially out for the Galaxy S25 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">in beta for the S24 series</a>. If you’ve got other compatible Galaxy S models, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">expect the update to roll out by the end of March 2025</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-27">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Zuckerberg’s had enough of leaks at Meta and sent a memo warning that leaking info could get employees fired, but of course, the memo itself leaked almost right away.</li><li>Meta's CEO is cutting back on transparency in meetings after leaks made it clear that too much info was slipping out.</li><li>To stop leaks, Meta’s ditching the old Q&A style for a poll system, where employees vote on the questions they care about most.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg is fed up with Meta employees spilling the tea from internal meetings. The company sent out a memo warning that leaking info could cost them their job. But, in a classic twist, the memo itself got leaked almost immediately.</p><p>Meta’s CISO, Guy Rosen, sent out a memo doubling down on the company’s no-leak policy. The message was clear: if you’re caught sharing internal info, you could face serious consequences—like getting fired.</p><p>To address this concern, Zuckerberg is dialing back on transparency in company-wide meetings after too many leaks. In an audio clip snagged by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-says-everything-i-say-leaks-in-leaked-meeting-audio/" target="_blank">404 Media</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fortune.com/2025/01/31/meta-fire-staff-for-leaks-zuckerberg-updates-memo/" target="_blank">Fortune</a>), he said, “We try to be really open and then everything I say leaks."</p><p>At Meta’s latest meeting, Mark Zuckerberg cited some pretty controversial updates. He talked about cutting back on DEI programs, tweaking hate speech rules (including ones around sexual orientation), and how the company plans to use performance metrics to decide who might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-social-media-reality-labs-layoffs-2024">get hit with layoffs</a>.</p><p>Rosen stressed that when company data gets leaked or stolen, the fallout isn’t just about the immediate security risks—it goes way beyond that.</p><p>"Our teams become demoralized, and we all waste time that is better spent working on our products and toward our goals and mission," he said.</p><p>To crack down on leaks, Meta is ditching the old Q&A style for a voting system. The company is switching to a “poll” system where employees can submit questions ahead of time and vote on them. That way, the discussions focus on the topics everyone actually cares about—and hopefully, fewer details end up spilling out.</p><p>Meta used to let employees throw questions into the open during Q&A sessions, with upvotes deciding which ones got the spotlight. But this year, things changed—the vote counts were hidden, and commenting got shut down, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/603754/mark-zuckerberg-tells-employees-to-buckle-up-in-leaked-all-hands-meeting" target="_blank">The Verge</a>.</p><p>Big companies with tons of employees are basically leak magnets—it’s almost inevitable that some sensitive info or internal drama will slip out. The bigger the team, the harder it is to keep everything under wraps.</p>

<p><em><strong>Several people have written in complaining about Music Player - MP3 Player from Red Sky Labs (formerly known as Muzio Player). None of them had anything good to say.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>It seems that the app went with a freemium subscription model, showing ads unless a user pays a monthly fee. That's fine, but when Red Sky Labs did this, they cancelled the premium plan of  users who had previously paid for an ad-free experience.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Play Store reviews confirm this, so I'm naming the company to warn you to consider its past behavior before you give it any money.</strong></em></p>
<p>I hate to hear about this sort of thing, but it's more common than you think. I've been bitten by the very same bug with another app that went free with a subscription after I gave them $5.99 for extra content. You can guess what happened when the app updated. There is a very good chance something similar has happened to you, too.</p><p>Why? Are mobile app stores filled with dishonest people trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail-now-uses-a-new-ai-model-to-try-and-fend-off-holiday-scams">scam a couple of bucks</a> at a time until they've built a fortune? Not really, though those people certainly exist; it's just too easy to get away with it, so app publishers may simply not care.</p>
<p>Here's the rub — it's not legal to do what Red Sky Labs did with its music player. It's also against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google/developer-content-policy/" rel="nofollow">Google's Play Store rules</a>. And neither of those things matters because of the small amount of money involved. If you pay for a lifetime service, it is expected to last the lifetime of one of the parties. If you change your business model, you need to make accommodations for people who have already paid.</p><p>Good luck getting anyone to care about it and help you get your five bucks back because it's <em>only</em> five bucks. You're not taking some developer to small claims court over five bucks. No lawyer will take that as a case because it's only five bucks. It's your five bucks, and if you're like me, you feel willing to fight through Mordor to get it back, but nobody else cares about your five bucks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="u5VYEReQmUxKVZKFDkMmyA" name="Google-Play-Protect-app.jpeg" alt="Google Play Protect app showing recently scanned apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u5VYEReQmUxKVZKFDkMmyA.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google and Apple <em>should</em> care, and on some level, they do. But they each have bigger things to worry about. With millions of apps moving through mobile stores the majority of time and effort is spent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-google-play-protect">making sure they are safe</a> and they handle the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/problem-android-permissions-too-much-information-and-not-enough-information-all-once">intricate permissions</a> correctly. And that's surely hard to manage, so I'm not surprised that reports about this to Google go mostly unanswered. <strong>Do not let this stop you from reporting the offending app.</strong></p>
<p>Also, if you're so inclined, don't forget about posting to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/thanks-reddit-you-can-now-block-youtube-ads-without-going-through-any-hoops">Reddit</a> and other social media so other people can read and pile on. Attention is how you rectify this kind of problem. If enough people complain, Google or Apple must act, and the app publisher may even find a way to fix the problem so they aren't forced to give a bunch of people five bucks in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-redeem-google-play-points-movies-shows-and-apps-google-tv">app store credit</a>.</p><p>Finally, send detailed reports about what's happening to every tech website you regularly visit. When I see several people saying the same thing, I look into it. If it's something other people need to hear — like an app publisher bringing back the ads and keeping the five bucks — I'll write about it.</p><p>This app has over 100 million downloads at Google Play. People need to know more about the company before it gets another 100 million.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-32">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>New trademarks in the UK and New Zealand hint that Samsung’s mixed reality headset might be called “Beyond.”</li><li>The New Zealand trademark application lists products like VR, AR, and XR headsets, potentially linking “Beyond” to Samsung’s upcoming device.</li><li>However, BigScreenVR already holds a trademark for "Beyond," though its registration details are unclear.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New trademarks in the UK and New Zealand are pointing to Samsung’s mixed reality headset being called “Beyond.”</p><p>Back in December, Samsung and Google gave us a preview of their joint XR headset project, known internally as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>. They shared a few images and teased some possible features for the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> platform, giving us a taste of what’s to come.</p><p>At last month’s Samsung Unpacked 2025 event, the much-hyped XR headset got a quick, low-key showcase. Even though it’s been over a month since the teaser, we’re still in the dark about what the device will actually be called.</p><p>As spotted by Brad Lynch, new trademark applications in the UK and New Zealand might have spilled the beans on what Samsung’s upcoming mixed-reality headset will be called (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xrdailynews.com/samsung-mr-headset-may-launch-as-galaxy-beyond/" target="_blank">XR Daily News</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung’s recently unveiled Mixed Reality Headset may be called the “Samsung Beyond” or “Galaxy Beyond”This is based on trademarks filed in the UK and New Zealand last monthThanks @LaidBackDev_ for the heads up! pic.twitter.com/C3qShVxURr<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1885206610412249524">January 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The filings suggest the device could roll out as either "Samsung Beyond."</p><p>The New Zealand trademark application covers a wide variety of products, from TVs and smart glasses to digital door locks. But what really stands out is the mention of VR, AR, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">XR headsets</a>, hinting that this could be tied to the highly anticipated device.</p><p>If the trademark gets the green light, "Beyond" is likely to become the name for Samsung’s upcoming headset.</p><p>That said, BigScreenVR already has a headset called "Beyond" and was quick to chime in on Lynch’s tweet, saying they hold the trademark for the name. But here’s the catch—details about where and how their trademark is registered are still up in the air.</p><p>Project Moohan is still in the prototype stage, so details like the release date and price for Samsung’s XR headset are a mystery for now. That said, whispers are floating around that it could cost at least half as much as Apple’s Vision Pro.</p><p>In his YouTube video, Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) highlighted that the headset ditches the over-the-head strap, opting for a single adjustable strap at the back, much like the Meta Quest Pro. Brownlee mentioned that this setup, paired with the distinct facial interface, makes it feel pretty comfortable without needing the extra strap—unlike the Vision Pro, which doesn’t quite pull it off.</p>

The tipster goes into some purported specs, stating the phone will feature a "newly developed display and film" specifically for it. Apparently, these new pieces of hardware haven't been applied to the company's typical book-style device, the Z Fold.</p><p>Other alleged specifications include the device's 10-inch display when unfolded fully and a height of 6.54 inches.</p><p>Speaking of the phone's purported build, rumors claim Samsung's tri-fold, which will likely go up against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">Huawei's Mate XT</a>, weighs "the same" as the Chinese device, but is also "slightly thicker."</p><p>For its folding method, the tipster states Samsung's version will "fold/unfold on both sides."</p><p>Its launch details are still being speculated; however, current rumors pin its launch either "later this year" or "early 2026." Later in 2025 could push us past Samsung's usual summer Unpacked and into the fall. But, we'll have to wait and see how the company plays this.</p>

<p>There are some aspects of the current rumors that we're hearing consistently now, like the idea of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-device-production-details-rumored">a "G-shaped" fold style</a>. It was reported earlier in January that Samsung could deploy this unique folding shape for the device to improve its display's durability. The folding style shake-up could involve an "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-phone-development-rumor">inward</a>" mechanic, as well. To elaborate, the report claims the device will have an "in-folding method that folds the inside of the screen inward twice."</p><p>Moreover, there were rumors that the new display tech the "G Fold" could have is something new from Samsung Display. That side of the Korean OEM is supposedly preparing to debut this new screen tech, which <em>could </em>happen during MWC 2025.</p><p>The idea of a Samsung tri-fold has become even more real after the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">teased the device</a> during Unpacked. In a long line of devices in-development, one silhouette, for a tri-fold, was spotted. A phone like this from Samsung has been rumored/thought about for years now — which was magnified by Huawei's surprise entry. Samsung didn't go into specifics about the phone during Unpacked.</p><p>However, rumors claim the company could begin producing the phone in preparation for launch in Q2 2025. So, perhaps these "late 2025" expectations could be met. Either way, let's not hold our breath. Things can always change.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-42">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google just made the Pixel Weather app way better by letting you easily switch between measurement units.</li><li>The new update adds a dedicated page where you can set units for rain, wind, pressure, and visibility.</li><li>Before, changing units meant messing with your phone’s language or region settings, which affected way more than just the app.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has finally given the Pixel Weather app a nice little upgrade, making it super easy to switch between different measurement units.</p><p>Since launching in August 2024 with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> lineup, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-new-weather-app-for-the-pixel-9-is-showing-up-early">revamped Pixel Weather app has been a hit</a>, thanks to its fresh design and smart weather summaries. But it hasn’t been all sunshine—users have been a bit frustrated with how clunky it is to tweak measurement units for things like rain and wind speed.</p><p>While temperature unit conversion has been around for a while, other metrics were left out. Now, Google seems to be fixing that.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-weather-app-measurements-units-apk-teardown-3506241/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google is rolling out Pixel Weather version 1.0.20250106.720365328.release, and it’s bringing a dedicated "Weather units" page. This update lets you pick your preferred units for stuff like rain, wind speed, pressure, and visibility—finally breaking free from the old system where these settings were stuck to your phone’s language.</p><p>Before, tweaking measurement units in the Pixel Weather app was a bit of a headache—you had to mess with your system language or regional settings, which affected way more than just the app.</p><p>Now, you can pick your favorite units for each metric by heading to <em>Profile icon</em> > <em>Pixel Weather settings</em> > <em>Weather units</em>. And if you’re tweaking temperature units, the "Temperature" page is still your go-to spot.</p>

<ul><li>Code found in the Pixel Watch Management Service system app shows a reference to "Adaptive charging."</li><li>Pixel phones currently learn from your charging habits to determine when to limit charging to 80% to protect battery life.</li><li>Wear OS watches currently have no way to stop charging before 100% power, though some can send a push notification to your phone.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has spent the last year hyper-focused on improving Android smartwatches' battery life, particularly its own Pixel Watch 3. Now, based on an APK teardown of Pixel Watch system software, it appears the next battery-preserving feature will be adaptive charging, ported over from Pixel phones.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-watch-adaptive-charging-apk-3522565/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> posted an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-watch-adaptive-charging-apk-3522565/">APK teardown</a> on Monday showing the following string of code:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-html" language="html" ><code><uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.wearable.pixel.pdms.permission.ADAPTIVE_CHARGING_SERVICE"/></code></pre>
<p>While the site didn't find any additional info, it's a fair assumption that the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-adaptive-charge-silent-updates">Pixel Adaptive Charging</a> feature on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and other Google phones will port to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> in a highly similar form — if not other Android watches.</p><p>On Pixel phones, if you turn on Charging optimization, the Android software will "learn" from your charging habits for two weeks; then, whenever you plug your phone in at night, it will shut off charging at 80% and only bring it to 100% at the point that you typically unplug it in the morning.</p><p>You can also manually limit charging to 80% on Pixel phones, so we're curious if that'll be another option for Pixel Watches, in addition to adaptive charging. Given that the Pixel Watch 3 lasts at least 24 hours with AOD enabled — and can last up to 48 hours with lighter use — it should last you a full day even if you put it on at 80% power.</p><p>Depending on its size, the Pixel Watch 3 takes about 35 or 50 minutes to hit 80%, and 60 or 80 minutes to hit 100%. The slower charging past 80% is already a built-in form of adaptive charging. Still, once your watch hits 100%, your battery capacity <em>will</em> steadily decrease over time, which is why Google enabled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-fully-charged-notifications-are-finally-rolling-out-widely">full-charge notifications last year</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.30%;"><img id="4VWzwYM3b2xvaPNLUwKzM3" name="Pixel-Watch-3-developer-mode" alt="Developer options on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4VWzwYM3b2xvaPNLUwKzM3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2259" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<hr>
<p>Google has reportedly started adding the missing pieces for its long-awaited encrypted messaging with emergency services.</p><p>During an APK teardown by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-prepares-rcs-based-text-to-911-apk-teardown-3522456/">Android Authority</a>, several new strings of code were added to Google Messages about 911 RCS texting support. It seems the company is beginning to add the necessary pieces for proper functionality, like "location_permission." Granting access to your device's location will likely be a requirement if you're interested in texting emergency services in the event of a problem.</p><p>There is another string, "enable_emergency_action," which seems to concern the users sent message when contacting 911.</p><p>Furthermore, there's a larger, overall section of code added: "enable_emergency_rcs-messaging."</p><p>The publication adds that the new code was discovered in the latest Google Messages update, version 20250129. While it's stated that this beta "enables" RCS texting with 911, there's not much else to surface. What this could look like (officially) on-device wasn't detailed, nor anything else of notable interest.</p><p>Perhaps we're coming up on its widespread Android rollout, considering Google said as much last summer.</p>

<p>In June 2024, Google announced that it was bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-announces-911-rcs-texting-to-android">RCS texting services with 911</a>. It  was stated that support would let users send high-quality images and videos to first responders to help them understand "your situation." Users can also see when the authorities are actively responding to your request for aid. More importantly, Google's partnership with RapidSOS brings the location-sharing side of this feature.</p><p>Data from the FCC showed that roughly 53% of the emergency centers in the U.S. support text messages as a viable form of communication. Through this 911 RCS support, Google seeks to bring it to every call center/agency across the country for free.</p><p>The company said in its June announcement that it planned to roll this out to Android users "this winter." We have crossed into February already, so hopefully these newfound Google Message strings indicate its approaching release.</p><p>Earlier this month, Google made good on another feature: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-dual-sim-rcs-support-more-users-regions-stable">dual SIM RCS support</a>. More users in the U.S., Canada, and Germany on the Pixel 9 and a few Galaxy devices started noticing the update arrive. The feature seemingly arrived for those on Verizon, AT&T, and USMobile plans. The patch brings additional settings, which let users choose to activate RCS for both SIMs or for whichever you'd prefer.</p>

<ul><li>Huawei patented a 3D fingerprint sensor for its smartwatches for both biometric ID and gesture controls.</li><li>The patent suggests you'd be able to twist your finger (counter-)clockwise to adjust watch settings like volume and brightness.</li><li>Smartwatches would also recognize multiple fingerprints in order to register different actions to specific fingers.</li><li>Samsung and Apple previously patented smartwatch fingerprint sensors in 2018 and 2022, respectively.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Smartwatches with contactless payments universally rely on clunky PIN systems for security. We've seen Galaxy and Apple Watch patents for in-display fingerprint sensors or Touch ID built into a button, but neither smartwatch brand has brought the idea to actual products. Now Huawei has an even more intriguing fingerprint smartwatch patent, tantalizing us with a feature we may never see for ourselves.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/mobiles/mobiles-news/huawei-multi-functional-3d-fingerprint-sensor-patent-details/" target="_blank">MySmartPrice</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wareable.com/news/huawei-hidden-smartwatch-fingerprint-sensor-patent" target="_blank">Wareable</a>), Huawei's patent describes a three-dimensional "advanced optical fingerprint sensor" built into the AMOLED smartwatch display that can recognize your fingerprint at any angle.</p><p>Huawei's patented idea is to let you register multiple fingerprints, then attribute specific actions to each finger; in one figure, tapping a message with your thumb, index, or middle finger triggers three different responses, including calling the messenger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:820px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="u4yBWa33a3gRMnvdLYXxY" name="huawei-fingerprint-patent" alt="A patent figure showing a generic smartwatch and a hand with a pointing index finger at various angles, showing the watch owner pressing their finger on the display and twisting it in different directions to trigger specific actions." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u4yBWa33a3gRMnvdLYXxY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="820" height="461" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In another patent image, it shows the smartwatch owner twisting their index finger to "control volume and display brightness through gestures," with the direction of the twist — clockwise or counterclockwise — deciding whether the volume goes up or down.</p><p>Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> and Apple Watches can recognize gestures like finger pinches for shortcuts, but long-pressing or twisting specific fingers on a screen might feel more exact and natural to some users. Recognizing multiple fingerprints would also let you set multiple favorite apps or actions.</p><p>Plus, of course, you'd finally have the option to use a payment app without needing to hen-and-peck a PIN number on a tiny watch screen, or worry about someone else guessing your PIN. Instead, the Huawei watch would prompt you for your fingerprint after you trigger Google Wallet (or Huawei Pay, in this case).</p>

<p>Samsung first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.patentlymobile.com/2018/11/samsung-patent-illustrates-continued-work-on-under-display-fingerprint-scanning-for-future-smartphones-and-galaxy-watch.html">patented</a> the idea of an under-display fingerprint sensor in 2018, but the patent itself was quite vague, also suggesting the idea that their watches might have an under-display camera for an "iris scanner" to authenticate the wearer. Neither ever came to pass, and it seems unlikely Samsung has any current plans for fingerprint tech, no matter how useful it might be in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>.</p><p>Apple's 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/patent-reveals-apple-watch-touch-id-not-where-we-expected">Touch ID patent</a> felt much more thought out, with a sensor built into the Side button that could authenticate the user or approve a transaction. But despite how useful this sounded, nothing has come of it, nor of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/touch-id-might-be-coming-apple-watch">previous report</a> in 2022 claiming Apple wanted to stick the fingerprint sensor in the Apple Watch S7 crown.</p><p>So while Huawei's patent sounds intriguing, it's a bit bittersweet to consider the Chinese smartwatch brand potentially being the first to implement it in its watches, considering you rarely see Huawei products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/huawei-sets-sights-squarely-on-samsung-with-watch-gt-5-series">Huawei GT 5 Pro</a> sold outside of Asia. A large portion of smartwatch power users who depend on contactless payments will have to keep tapping in a PIN code for the foreseeable future, with no better alternative.</p><p>Of course, Huawei might very well never use this fingerprint sensor idea, either! The brand may decide that embedding a complex 3D fingerprint sensor may be more trouble than it's worth, due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/researchers-detail-bruteprint-attack-android-fingerprint-sensors">security issues</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-fingerprint-problems-continue">fingerprint recognition problems</a> we've seen on Android phones over the years.</p>

<ul><li>Drivers with the TomTom GO app on Android Auto have taken to its Play Store review page to report issues.</li><li>Users state they are receiving error messages and a completely sour experience, which could've been caused by a new Android Auto update.</li><li>While the devs work on a fix, Android Auto suffered audio stuttering and error messages late last year, as well.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Drivers are encountering an issue with a navigational app for cars and trucks with Google's in-car software.</p><p>Users have reportedly taken <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tomtom.gplay.navapp&hl=en&pli=1">to the Play Store</a> to report issues with the TomTom GO app on Android Auto (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/03/android-auto-tomtom-go-app-issues/">9to5Google</a>). Many of the most recent reviews on the store in February voice display issues and permission problems with the navigational tool. One user with a review on February 2 states, "Disappointing as the app does not want to display on Android Auto in car."</p><p>A day later, another user piggybacked off a previous review, adding that their granted permissions are "not recognized" by TomTom GO in a 2024 Toyota Yaris Cross. They state that, even after re-applying the permissions, the same error message appears, forcing them to repeat the process.</p><p>Strangely, the problems have seemingly started in January — most notably, toward the end of the month.</p><p>There are a host of TomTom GO app reviews between January 29 and 30, where users state the program no longer works with Android Auto. Users are encountering GPS problems but, more importantly, they state the issue occurred <em>after </em>the recent Android Auto software update.</p><p>It's unclear whether the issue is connected (though it seems likely). The support team behind TomTom GO is aware of the problem and is actively working to fix it. A TomTom International BV representative responded to one user report stating, "We are sorry to hear about the problem and we are aware of this issue - Our developers are actively working on it. As soon we have any updates we will let you know via release notes."</p>

<p>Among the many navigational apps, TomTom Go sought to separate itself with car <em>and </em>truck features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tomtom-go-nav-trucker-routes">that arrived a while back</a>. The company released a "truck plan" for drivers of larger vehicles so they can plan routes "differently from others." The addition was seen as positive, considering vehicle size (think sixteen-wheelers) and weight can't go everywhere other cars can. The update lets truck drivers see traffic, truck parking, height restrictions, and more.</p><p>Android Auto encountered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-rolls-out-bug-fixes-for-error-messages">some issues late last year</a> (Dec 24), involving stuttering audio and error messages. Users were encouraged to remain on v13.3 of the OS after the problem surfaced. Playing music or listening to information from Google Maps gave users stuttering audio issues while error messages hit users with a Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>To begin January, Google pushed Android Auto <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-rolls-into-the-polestar-2-to-cover-some-gaps-in-android-automotive">onto the Polestar 2</a>, bringing with it an HD Radio, seamless phone connecting, and a brand new media player.</p>

Sure, there are some exceptions, such as Balatro, Monument Valley, or Pokemon TCGP.</p><p>However, most of my mobile gaming is done via emulation, such as relaxing with Pokemon Pinball or firing up whatever Switch game tickles my fancy at the time. During those times that I wanted to play PC games, I either grabbed one of my x86 handhelds, actually sat at my desktop, or relied on a combination of Moonlight or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/geforce-now">NVIDIA GeForce Now</a>.</p>

<p>That might not be the case for very much longer, as many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> can actually be used to play games designed for computers. Much of this is made possible by Winlator, an app that basically lets you run x86_64 games right on your Android phone or tablet.</p><p>When Winlator first landed on GitHub <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/brunodev85/winlator/releases/tag/v1.0.0">back in 2023</a>, there was little fanfare simply because it was still far too limited in what was possible. For instance, the biggest limitation is that you can only play DRM-free games. These games are most commonly found on GOG, but there are some that might already be found in your Steam library.</p><p>Since its release, Winlator has exploded in popularity, at least in the emulation scene. But the biggest hurdle for adoption has been the actual setup process of getting your games installed and running.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xm6fHHiGHyoYwS8xWcpRNX" name="winlator-odin-2-balatro-legion-go-s" alt="Winlator installing game on AYN Odin 2 and Balatro on Legion Go S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xm6fHHiGHyoYwS8xWcpRNX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not as simple as dragging and dropping files and then tapping a button, as there are quite a few different settings to change. Not to mention that just because you find the right configuration for what game, doesn't mean that the same settings will work for another.</p><p>I bring up Winlator specifically because there are countless forks and alternative versions, some aiming to provide better performance, while others attempt to make it possible to download compatible games from Steam. And over the past couple of weeks, there are three new apps that make it possible to play Windows games on Android.</p><p>The first of which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5125193439382355">Winplay Engine from Xiaomi</a>, letting you download and install games from Steam onto your device. Unfortunately, this is still in beta and is currently only available if you own the Xiaomi Pad 6S Pro. Since I don't have the Pad 6S Pro, I haven't been able to take Winplay for a spin.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CUufF4F7z4B7gX47VMJkTX" name="pluvia-on-galaxy-s25-ultra-2" alt="Pluvia app for Windows emulation on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CUufF4F7z4B7gX47VMJkTX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/oxters168/Pluvia">Pluvia </a>was the next app on the list but is a bit different as it's designed to specifically let you play DRM-free games from your personal Steam library. While I was able to get it installed and running on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, the results have been <em>very</em> hit-or-miss.</p><p>Even lightweight titles such as Pizza Tower or Stardew Valley don't seem to work. Meanwhile, games like UFO 50, Super Meat Boy, and Undertale work <em>mostly</em> fine, with the occasional audio issues or random slowdowns.</p><p>Then we have an app that I've been kind of keeping an eye on from afar, as I first heard about it late last year. GameSir makes many of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">mobile controllers</a>, but the company is also apparently kind of getting into the emulation scene.</p><p>It's doing so with the release of the GameHub app, which is currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gamehub.xiaoji.com/">only available to download directly</a>. However, GameHub stands out from the pack in a few different ways, and not just for allowing you to play Windows games on Android. It also lets you stream games from other platforms, such as your PC, Xbox, or PlayStation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ozntGWzhmbrJDgm4zJu8TX" name="gamesir-gamehub-home-screen" alt="Emulation on Android devices with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, AYANEO Pocket DMG, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ozntGWzhmbrJDgm4zJu8TX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>More importantly, GameHub is basically a fancy wrapper for Winlator, taking a lot of the potential frustration out of trying to play Windows games on Android. Instead of tinkering with menus that are clearly from Windows 98, GameHub puts everything in a modern interface.</p><p>And if you install the GameHub app for your Windows desktop PC, you can sync your Steam library and stream games to your device. However, there's also a "Game Assistant" feature that lets you import games from your computer to your phone, making it possible to play certain titles locally.</p><p>I'm still putting GameHub through its paces, but I have been able to get a few games to load. I can't tell you how awesome it is to be able to play the original Star Wars Battlefront II on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> should be the most powerful chip to date, I'm going to also try and install some heavier titles just to see what happens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vnqGhoadne2MgfqhH7bwSX" name="rog-ally-x-legion-go-s-odin-2-pocket-dmg-gaming" alt="Ayaneo Pocket DMG emulating Switch, Odin 2 with Winlator, Balatro on Legion Go S, and Bazzite on ROG Ally X" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnqGhoadne2MgfqhH7bwSX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even with apps like GameHub providing a solution that is far easier to navigate than Winlator, I don't expect x86 game emulation on Android to even come close to the retro gaming scene. There's <em>a lot</em> of trial and error, and even installing just one game can take forever.</p><p>Even still, it's simply incredible that it's even possible to get ANY x86 game installed on a mobile phone. Let alone with stable frame rates and without immediately crashing.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube has new experimental features for its Premium tier users.</li><li>The prominent ones include the ability to watch a YouTube video at 4x speed.</li><li>Jump ahead is another nifty feature in the works, which should help users jump to their favorite content faster.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube has great perks for users who subscribe to its Premium tier subscription. Users can avoid ads, use YouTube Music, and much more. Other than the already available ones, the company allows users to test some new upcoming or experimental features, and the video streaming platform already has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/new">bunch of them</a>.</p><p>YouTube currently allows users to watch content at speeds ranging from 0.25x, 0.5x to 1.75x and 2x. It adds convenience to users who want to finish the video soon or take it slow per their requirements and it is especially beneficial when listening to podcasts, for example.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:790px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:59.24%;"><img id="D7ieRoknMLXSCeikYJz8Sf" name="youtube-playback-speed-4x" alt="YouTube 4x playback speed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D7ieRoknMLXSCeikYJz8Sf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="790" height="468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, the streaming giant’s latest experimental feature now allows users to adjust speeds for up to 4x. The fine-tuning of speeds is currently available for mobile handsets like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and iOS devices, and not on the web just yet.</p><p>Needless to say, the experimental feature is only for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/i-canceled-spotify-and-used-youtube-music">YouTube Premium </a>users. It is still unclear how exactly the 4x speeds would be useful while watching a video, and the only reason we think of is perhaps to finish the video or skip to the preferred part 2x faster than the currently available speeds. The aforementioned mobile handset users can use this experimental feature until February 26.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:790px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="9vvCQFHt6NUe8cjXDuHc7g" name="youtube-jump-ahead-feature" alt="YouTube Jump Ahead" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9vvCQFHt6NUe8cjXDuHc7g.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="790" height="444" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to skipping content, Jump Ahead is another interesting experimental feature that “enables viewers to get to the content they care about faster.” It is a new floating button to get to your favorite content even faster and is now available on the web. However, the clock’s already ticking on this feature because the ability to experiment with this feature for YouTube Premium users is ending on February 5.</p><p>The other notable experimental features that are available include a high-quality audio feature, which lets users listen to the best quality audio for the eligible music videos on the platform. The high-quality audio here translates to 256kbps (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/603581/youtube-premium-experimental-test-4x-speed-now-available">The Verge</a>) and is available for users on iOS and Android until February 22.</p>
<p>Further, iOS users can experience YouTube Shorts video in picture-in-picture mode when switching between apps just like regular YouTube video – and it is for YouTube Premium users only. Similarly, again on iOS, users can enable “Smart downloads” for YouTube Shorts, which allows them to automatically download shorts for offline viewing.</p><p>All mentioned experimental features for YouTube Premium users will perhaps add a better viewing experience than the service already offered at the moment. It still needs to be determined which of these will roll out officially in the coming weeks or months.</p>

<p>Samsung’s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">Galaxy S25 </a>series is set to reach the people who have preordered in the coming week. Meanwhile, we got information about the next Galaxy phones — thanks to a couple of tipsters on X.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7, which is likely to debut in some time in Q3 this year, a tipster Anthony (@TheGalox_) has shared some interesting information on the foldable handset. It is believed to be on the lines of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a> foldable phone.</p>

<p>Samsung has a Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition handset for the Korean market other than the regular Galaxy Z Fold 6. For the uninformed, the former has bigger displays and is lighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The primary camera on the Z Fold Editor is also a new 200MP sensor.</p><p>According to the tipster, these features are expected on the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7. Additionally, users can expect a bigger vapor chamber, a faster chip, and better speakers than the special edition handset.</p><p>The bigger vapor chamber integration has been witnessed on the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> of Samsung, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.

<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Sunday Runday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rV2GgqHS9nqccNipGMkWqB" name="lloyd-break-dancing.jpg" caption="" alt="Lloyd, the Android Central mascot, break-dancing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rV2GgqHS9nqccNipGMkWqB.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/sunday-runday">weekly column</a>, Android Central Wearables Editor Michael Hicks talks about the world of wearables, apps, and fitness tech related to running and health, in his quest to get faster and more fit.</p></div></div>
<p>Ever since I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-review">first-gen Shokz OpenFits</a> in 2023, I've worn them for hundreds of runs, walks, and hikes, no exaggeration. My ear canals have had an unprecedented break from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout earbuds</a> jammed into them, saving me from buds falling out during hard runs (which causes the sound to get worse), impacted ear wax, and the artificial hissing of transparency modes.</p><p>But using them for over a year made me well aware of the OpenFit's many flaws, from an obnoxious charging issue to finicky touch controls and average sound quality. So, I'm thrilled that the Shokz OpenFit 2 immediately fixed or improved on almost all of my complaints.</p><p>Shokz is best known for its bone conduction headphones, and I'm no audiophile to judge how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openrun-pro-2-review">Shokz OpenRun Pro 2</a> sound quality compares to the OpenFit 2's air conduction. All I know is that I prefer the latter's "natural" sound while still giving me (mostly) unimpeded situational awareness during runs and races. And now, I'm much more likely to use the OpenFit 2's multipoint pairing and wear them in non-fitness contexts.</p>


<h2 id="more-comfortable-than-ever-2">More comfortable than ever</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-worn" alt="A photo of the reviewer wearing the Shokz OpenFit 2, with its ear hook looped next to his glasses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My appreciation for the original OpenFit was how its ear hook placed the speaker directly over my ears without impeding them; I could safely hear approaching cyclists or "on your left" runners and even the sounds of nature if listening to quieter content like audiobooks. They've never once fallen off. I forget they're there aside from light pressure on the back and side of my ear, and the audio quality was good enough.</p><p>The Shokz OpenFit 2 retains the same concept and target audience (athletes) but with minor tweaks that began with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openswim-pro-and-openfit-air-review">Shokz OpenFit Air</a> — which were more comfortable but too budget-focused to be "better" than the originals.</p><p>The OpenFit 2 has a thinner outer hook that rounds into a softer, wider silicone edge than the original model. It's hard to describe the difference between the two, but the OpenFit 2 somehow sits more naturally in its over-ear position, while the original OpenFit feels as if it's pressing harder against my skin to stay in place. Plus, the thinner hook makes it take less ear-top space, sliding gracefully under my glasses temples without the same pressure as before.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1833px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-in-ear" alt="A close-up of one Shokz OpenFit 2 earbud in the reviewer's left ear" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1833" height="1031" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically, you got used to the Shokz OpenFit's fit for abbreviated workouts, but you'll enjoy wearing the OpenFit 2 for longer stretches.</p><p>The Shokz OpenFit design has no ANC and minimal passive blocking, but that's the whole point. I wear these while reading or doing chores around the house because I never miss my partner or cat calling for attention.</p><p>There's some noise pollution for bass-heavy songs if you put the volume loud enough — so it may not be the best fit for an office environment — but at the normal 25% volume I use indoors, people only hear something if they fully disregard my personal space and lean in.</p>
<h2 id="shokzingly-rich-sound-2">Shokzingly rich sound</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua" name="Shokz-OpenFit-2-speakers" alt="The Shokz OpenFit 2 earbuds sitting on a rock, both flipped over to show the main speakers that sit against your ears." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Equally important to comfort is sound, and the OpenFit 2 needed an upgrade. I noted that you "shouldn't necessarily expect a symphony for your ears" with the original OpenFits, defaulting to the Bass Boost option to offer reasonable low-end oomph and tolerating having to pump up the volume to the upper levels just to hear phone calls or podcasts clearly. At least for "normal" music, the sound sounded better than you'd expect, thanks to the "DirectPitch" tech.</p><p>Shokz directly addressed these issues with the OpenFit 2, adding a larger low-frequency driver and an independent high-frequency unit for "DualBoost Technology."</p><p>Ditching the marketing speak, I feel much more comfortable using the stock EQ setting because it hits highs and lows in a balanced, rich way; "luther" by Kendrick Lamar & SZA sounds rich and harmonious for both the deep and high portions, while Tommy Richman's "MILLION DOLLAR BABY" hits those falsetto notes and low beat with equal quality.</p><p>For folks seeking that alternative (or emo) feel, Billie Eilish's "WILDFLOWER" or Bon Iver's "Holocene" no longer sound quite as tinny as they did on the first-gen earbuds; in fact, the OpenFit 2 hits hard enough that even 50% volume is too loud for me for these quiet songs (unless I'm outside and dealing with ambient noise).</p><p>Now that I've started using these earbuds for my daily work grind, I do use the Treble Boost or Voice EQ settings for my instrumental & lo-fi soundtracks or my YouTube Let's Plays, but they generally sound quite lovely.</p><p>Honestly, the only negative to this audio boost is that when the music is loud enough, it'll get in the way of hearing your surroundings a bit. But as long as you're not blowing up your eardrums, you'll be bopping to the beat, <em>and</em> you'll remain alert.</p>

<p>Other key OpenFit 1-to-2 changes include a more energy-efficient Bluetooth chip, new physical buttons for touch controls, and one IP-level boost to water resistance.</p><p>The jump from Bluetooth 5.2 to 5.4 lets the OpenFit 2 sit in a low-power mode for much longer in case you forget to put them in the charging case, as well as stay strongly connected in busy signal areas. The original OpenFit earbud had the same capacity, and yet the OpenFit 2 is rated to last 11 hours, a four-hour jump. In my experience, they did last easily across an entire workday of streaming, and ultramarathoners can depend on the OpenFit 2 more.</p><p>By improving from IP54 to IP55 protection, Shokz made the OpenFit 2 capable of withstanding water jets; they're shower-proof and easier to safely clean under a strong sink, in other words. Your OpenFits are going to get gunked up with sweat over time, and the better resistance might make them last a bit longer before the speaker and mic quality are affected.</p><p>My favorite upgrade is the new physical button, however. The first-gen OpenFit solely used touchpad controls, and I can't tell you how often they failed to recognize double-taps or made me accidentally hang up on people when I merely wanted to adjust their fit.</p><p>By contrast, the new elevated buttons are easy to find and activate — but no longer something you'll press by mistake. They blend into the silver finish of the earbud, so they don't look tacky or old-fashioned. And most importantly, the touchpad only has one optional-on feature for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> or Siri, eliminating any confusion and frustration.</p>

<p><em>The</em> most important Shokz OpenFit 2 change isn't something Shokz put in its specs sheet. After my initial review period, I noticed that the OpenFit would stay connected to my phone inside the charging case, meaning they weren't charging. I can't tell you how often I'd find <em>one</em> earbud dead and the other fully charged the next day. I'd have to wipe down the magnetic pins and shift the buds around, then close the case and check the app to see if both had successfully disconnected.</p><p>I asked Shokz about this issue since many OpenFit owners had similar complaints. They assured me that the OpenFit 2 had fewer contact points (2 vs. 3) <em>and</em> a much stronger magnet than the last-gen buds. You're still supposed to "keep the pins dry and clean during use to avoid any residue affecting proper contact," and it'll take months to see if a similar problem pops up; for now, though, I'm very optimistic, as I can feel how securely the OpenFit 2 snaps into place when inserted.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-buy-the-shokz-openfit-2-2">Should you buy the Shokz OpenFit 2?</h2>
<p>I still have requests for the Shokz OpenFit 3, most notably wear detection — so they turn off and don't take calls when sitting outside the case — and a way to ping the charging case. If you buy the black OpenFit 2, choose a consistent place to put the case after workouts, or you <em>will</em> lose them constantly. Plus, the Shokz app should ideally notify you when the case hits 0%.</p><p>But these complaints feel more nitpicky compared to the fundamental issues with the first-gen OpenFit. By and large, the Shokz OpenFit 2 sound fantastic, feel natural when worn with glasses, and let you keep your ear canals open instead of having hard plastic shoved into them for hours at a time.</p><p>The Shokz OpenFit 2 won't match your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> or even normal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> for surround-sound quality or ANC, so they may not be the right choice if you're looking for an all-day choice for every scenario that closely syncs with your smartphone. It's still a niche and fairly expensive product.</p><p>That said, I fall within the target Shokz OpenFit 2 niche, and I'm supremely happy with them!</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Phone cases are a dime a dozen, and most don't go out of the way to look too unique. Occasionally, you might find a really nice thin case or one that slaps your favorite movie characters on the back, but what if you removed 90% of the case and could still protect your phone?</p><p>I first heard of the Arc Pulse case when the company teased its Galaxy S25 Arc Pulse case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/enter_arc/p/DFX55KhTaGf/">a few days ago</a>, and while that case isn't available yet, the company does sell its cases for the Galaxy S24 series, Google Pixel 9 series, and several different iPhones.</p><p>These ultra-minimalist cases are built out of Aluminum 7075-T6 and feature a rubber-like Elastomer inlay to keep them snuggly attached to the phone at all times. The case design is so outlandish there was no way I could pass up the opportunity to test it, and I'm sure glad I did.</p>

<h2 id="the-drop-test-2">The drop test</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lMcYXG5BWCM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Let's just get right to business, shall we?</p><p>I don't often drop test phones in cases because so many cases are very similar, but Arc Pulse is a different beast entirely. For the test, I dropped the phone on three different flooring types: a wood floor, an area rug placed on concrete, and bare concrete. I dropped it at pocket height, roughly 3ft, and at head height, roughly 6ft, to simulate the two most common ways someone might drop their phone.</p><p>To my surprise, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> was spotless after all these drops. No scratches, cracks, or any other damage was found, and the case's unique design is surprisingly effective.</p>

<p>The case is designed to primarily protect the corners of the phone, with a lip around the front and back to keep the glass surfaces from coming into contact with any surface.</p><p>Of course, being so exposed in most places means that it will certainly not survive a drop onto an uneven surface if the screen or back glass hits a rock or something similar. In other words, you'll want to pair this case with one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-screen-protectors">best Google Pixel 9 Pro XL screen protectors</a> to ensure that screen doesn't get shattered.</p>

<p>Because of the metal construction, the Arc Pulse case feels incredibly high quality and is as shiny as those side rails on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, matching the aesthetic quite nicely. Corner coverage works well because of the weight, helping ensure it most often falls on one of the corners rather than flat on the front or back.</p><p>I've purposefully dropped it about a dozen times now and haven't seen a time when it fell flat on its face or back. Even if I dropped the phone flat, it would angle to one of the corners naturally before hitting the ground.</p>

<p>After several drops on the concrete, a crack developed in the top left corner of the Arc Pulse case. This isn't terribly surprising given the sheer weight of the phone and the case together being dropped on hard concrete. Metal is more protective but it's also more rigid than the usual materials used to make a phone case.</p><p>The result is the potential to crack if dropped on other rigid surfaces a lot, but the case has still held together very well despite this damage. Despite the ultra minimalist coverage, I'm super confident about the Arc Pulse case's ability to protect my phone. I was extremely nervous dropping it on concrete but it survived every attempt without scratching or damaging the phone at all, even from 6ft up. That, alone, is worth a recommendation!</p>

So what exactly is this?</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek</a> is an open-source AI ChatBot based on Meta's free and open-source <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q3-2024-earnings">Llama 3.3,</a> trained by the DeepSeek team. But what's fueling the hype is that the company claims they developed this LLM at an exponentially lower price than most other LLMs we know of today. By comparison, OpenAI charges $200 a month for ChatGPT Pro, while DeepSeek R1 gives you the same skills as the LLM for free.</p><p>While understanding how this large language model is gaining its skills, AI analyst <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=803X112721&xs=1&url=https://x.com/Dorialexander/status/1884167945280278857&xcust=4-1-2591529-1-0-0-0-0&sref=https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2591529/deepseek-ai-confirmed-to-be-powered-by-a-huawei-chip.html">Alexander Doria</a> confirmed in a recent X post the chip powering the DeepSeek R1 model, stating that DeepSeek’s R1 large-language model (LLM) was first trained using NVIDIA's H100, but now it fully functions on Huawei’s Ascend 910C chip to generate responses.</p><p>DeepSeek seems to be shifting the norm by making well-developed AI accessible to everyone for free and being independent of U.S-based chip companies putting them at risk. For the first time,  NVIDIA took a massive hit on Monday, losing $593 billion in market value as their stocks tanked.</p><p>It remains to be seen how this AI model will take on the big players in the business and whether it will be able to keep up its hype.</p>

<p>The company also issued a temporary fix to those affected, asking them to hard reset their devices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/01/garmin-watches-are-crashing-when-trying-to-start-gps.html" target="_blank">DC Rainmaker</a> reported that the issue stems from a bad "satellite pre-cache file" that was putting these watches in a bootloop.</p><p>The recommendation is still to hold down your watch's Light or Power button for up to 30 seconds to turn it off, then turn it back on and see if the problem is resolved.  After two days of experimenting with a fix, Garmin said, "We have resolved the underlying issue causing some devices to be stuck on the startup screen or a blue triangle" on a banner located on its Garmin Support page.</p><p>And if you "Press and hold the power/light button on the device until the watch shuts off," turn it back on, then sync it with your Connect app or plug it into your computer's Garmin Express app, it should solve your watch's issue and replace the malicious file that caused this issue.</p>

It all began when a Samsung blog and some Amazon listings suggested that a Bluetooth S Pen that is compatible with the  Galaxy S25 Ultra could be bought separately.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra launched without a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen, built-in or sold separately.

Additionally, some Amazon listings for the official S25 Ultra S Pen in certain regions also mention Bluetooth support. Samsung's official listings didn't mention this; however, the situation quickly snowballed since the listing shows only the standard Galaxy S25 Ultra S Pen and the S Pen Pro.</p><p>Later, attempts to link the S Pen Pro to the S25 Ultra during a media briefing failed, and a Samsung exec eventually confirmed the two aren’t compatible.</p><p>Fast forward two days, Samsung had to remove all mentions of a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen from the blog post.</p>

Meta earned $48 billion in revenue during Q4 2024, and the company's full-year earnings totaled $164 billion, a 22% increase over 2023's $134 billion in overall revenue.</p><p>Meta attributed these massive numbers to ads revenue, bringing in a record-breaking $46.7 billion, while Meta's Reality Labs division also broke records with $1.08 billion in revenue. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that ad revenue was up for two primary reasons: 3.35 billion people used Meta products and services in 2024, delivering more ad impressions, while the average price per ad simultaneously increased 14% YoY.</p><p>Looking into 2025, Meta will be launching "a new, more personalized AI," and the company expects to reach 1 billion users by year's end. The company teased 2025 as the year "we get back to the OG Facebook" but didn't expand on that. Instagram, Reels, WhatsApp, and Threads also are expected to continue to grow throughout 2025.</p><p>Furthermore, Meta revealed that it plans to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-wants-billions-of-ai-glasses-worldwide-is-that-possible">billions of smart glasses</a> on the market, which sounds like a hefty goal given the current growth trajectory of the market.</p>

Chances are, most of them are going to tell you how great the thing is and that it is totally worth the money. Reviews are like that; it's not a knock on anyone who writes them or implying anything inappropriate, it's just that we like new things, especially when they are better than the things they're designed to replace.</p><p>I'm not going to be reviewing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a>. I hate reviewing phones, and I'm terrible at it, so my constant complaining about them has finally borne fruit, and I don't get tasked with writing them now. Never let it be said that complaining over and over can't be effective. I am, however, going to tell you that no matter how great the S25 seems to be, I'd wait until next year to buy one.</p>

I hate setting up a million things on a new phone, I hate it when apps don't keep track of their associated data and start up empty, and I especially hate opening my dusty wallet and spending money. That's why I love that phone makers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-says-new-pixels-and-galaxys-will-get-longer-software-support-than-iphones">support their products longer and longer</a> — it means I can wait.</p>
<p>It didn't used to be that way. I bought every new phone that tickled my fancy and never thought about a reason not to do so. That taught me a very important lesson — every new smartphone will have bugs. Some phones, namely anything chock full of new features, will be riddled with them.</p>
<p>I'm talking about both hardware and software bugs. Just because a new phone looks like the old model doesn't mean everything under the screen hasn't been changed. New phones get new hardware, and that means they have to make the changes to allow the software to work with it all.</p>

<p>The worst offenders, by a longshot, were always Google's own phones. Nexus phones and the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel line</a> all launched with a list of issues because they are a testbed for new features and new ways to use cheap hardware. Google should be the company doing this; it needs to experiment with ways to use and develop the platform, but putting a retail, consumer-grade label on testbed phones means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-wireless-charging-woes-reported">a lot of people will see a lot of issues</a>.</p><p><strong>The Galaxy S25 is Samsung's Pixel phone.</strong> It's the beginning of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-bixby-integration-announced">completely integrating AI</a> into every facet of the experience, not just the user-facing features,  using new hardware to do it. The new Samsung-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-shows-samsung-should-build-a-snapdragon-clone">custom Snapdragon paired with a new AI accelerator</a> is going to require plenty of software tweaking, and the user-facing software is never going to be completely finished. It will keep changing and improving until the phone reaches its end-of-life for support, only to be replaced with a new model that will be the same.</p>

<p>You might love this idea. I can relate — I used to feel the same back when I wanted to try and tweak everything in ways that broke warranties and circumvented corporate restrictions. Now, I'm not worried about trying new exploits to see if I can find a way to root a Snapdragon phone or break bootloader security. I don't see the need like I used to so I pass that torch to others and happily watch them try and fail, knowing they love doing it. The joy is in trying, just as much as succeeding.</p><p>Regular users (like I've become) just want everything to work. Hopefully, it will be as good as promised or even better, but at least perform in a way that isn't disruptive. The S25 will probably do just that — I don't expect any actual problems with the device that would cause you to stop using it.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24</a> is that way, too. I can get that near-excellent level of use without shelling out another $1,000. Next year, when they are half-price, would be the time I would look at buying an S25.</p>

I previously reviewed the Galaxy S24 Plus, so Samsung’s latest model feels both familiar and like a welcome refresh. In fact, with such a strong focus on AI, it's feeling more like I'm using a suped-up Pixel than a Galaxy phone.</p><p>Here are a few things that have stood out to me so far while using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>.</p>

<h2 id="color-is-everything-2">Color is everything</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2rFxm7o397dmTByV4fewg5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-Android-Bot" alt="The Android Bot figure on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2rFxm7o397dmTByV4fewg5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the past few years, I’ve been pretty unimpressed with Samsung’s color selection. The main hues for the S series phones have shifted toward pastels, and I constantly complain that it makes Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-boring-design">already boring-looking phones</a> appear even more dull. This year, things haven’t changed too much, as most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-color-should-you-buy">color options for the Galaxy S25 Plus</a> are still boring, but the standout colorway is the new Navy option.</p><p>The Navy Galaxy S25 Plus is the best color Samsung has launched for a phone since the green <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-review">Galaxy S22</a>. I love blue, so I'm a little biased, but the Navy hue is a deep blue with a very slight shimmer that almost glistens in direct sunlight. Depending on the angle and lighting, the phone almost appears indigo, which was a similar effect to the green Galaxy S22, which appeared blue in certain lighting. The frosted glass on the back is nicely contrasted with the thick black camera rings in the corner, while the flat frame gives off an almost neon glow.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4214px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UPRSGtTutKUDYmPm4852g5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-and-Galaxy-S22" alt="The Galaxy S25 Plus next to the Galaxy S22" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UPRSGtTutKUDYmPm4852g5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4214" height="2370" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to Samsung, the color is actually inspired by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, closely matching the hue of the signature sparkle icon that accompanies many consumer-facing features on Android phones. And given how focused the new phones are on AI, it’s a nice way to merge the design with the software. I admit that the phone’s design is still pretty tame, especially compared to other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. However, a great color selection really helps make things pop.</p><p>This is something Motorola figured out with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>. These phones aren’t offered in simple colors like black, white, or silver; each <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-motorola-razr-plus-2024-should-you-buy">Razr Plus 2024 color</a> is vibrant and unique, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-sets-trend-for-pink-phones">Hot Pink option</a>, which is a result of its partnership with Pantone. The Galaxy S25 series isn’t quite there yet, and many of the other color options retain the bland pastels (I guess someone must like them?), but with colors like Navy and even the Samsung-exclusive Coralred, the Galaxy S25 Plus already looks much more compelling than its predecessor.</p>
<h2 id="one-ui-7-is-smooth-like-butter-2">One UI 7 is smooth like butter</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4156px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="gCtzEbhj3PCSKj7d6NpSeE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-One-UI-7-home-screen" alt="One UI 7 home screen on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gCtzEbhj3PCSKj7d6NpSeE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4156" height="2338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Plus may look largely the same on the outside, but once you turn the phone on, it’s a different story. One UI 7 feels so good to use, and I already feel like this is the best version of Samsung’s software to date.</p><p>I’ve unapologetically been a big fan of One UI for some time, as I think the UI manages its space much better than the Pixel software. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, Samsung changed plenty of things around that make the software feel somewhat Pixel-like with its more bubbly UI elements while retaining the more efficient Samsung flair I’ve come to love while tweaking it in ways that I find pretty smart.</p><p>For instance, there’s now a <em>vertical</em> app drawer. Previously, in order to get a vertically scrolling app drawer, you’d have to install the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> app and go through the modules and settings. Now, you just have to change the app drawer to alphabetical sorting, which will change it from its default horizontal pagination (why it’s still the default is beyond me).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4193px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="949G5LxCYcVscWtEUTtmZ4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-Quick-Panel" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus Quick Panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/949G5LxCYcVscWtEUTtmZ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4193" height="2359" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there’s the Quick Panel and notification shade. By default, they’re separate, and while many people may not like this iPhone-esque take on the UI, it’s something I’ve gotten used to from other OEMs like Motorola. I already liked Samsung’s revamped take with One UI 6, which retains Wi-Fi and Bluetooth buttons as well as other settings like brightness, media output, and more.</p><p>One UI 7 takes it a step further with additional customization, and all the settings you want are more or less at your fingertips with the full-page Quick Panel. Samsung even took after the app drawer by ditching the horizontal scrolling for the customizable quick settings by turning it into an expandable panel.</p><p>I also like how notifications are displayed. If you get more than one notification from the same app, they’ll often stack on top of each other so as not to take up too much space from other notifications. This behavior also mimics the new multitasking screen, which also stacks open apps behind each other instead of placing them side by side. It all just makes for a more visually appealing and cohesive experience, and it feels like Samsung really thought this through.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zxZnzRSrhukKHFsJSmHh76" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-notification-shade" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus notification shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zxZnzRSrhukKHFsJSmHh76.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also can’t go without talking about how good it feels to use One UI 7. Everything you do feels so smooth and buttery without feeling like you’re stuck waiting for transitions to finish before doing the next thing. The lock and home screens feel like they’re floating up at you when you turn on the display, the Quick Panel and notification shade have a nice kinetic bounce to them, and animations between apps and screens are slick.</p><p>The experience is a stark contrast to One UI 6 on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> or even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>, which feels stiff by comparison. And while Android 15 on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> is admittedly very fast and fluid, even that feels like a half-step behind One UI 7. I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed the feeling of a UI this much.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-giving-pixel-2">It's giving Pixel</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dp9bHgC6vobevWKL4d3TrV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Google-Pixel-9-Pro-XL-display-home-screen-01" alt="Comparing the display and home screens of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus versus the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dp9bHgC6vobevWKL4d3TrV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But enough about how the software feels; what is it actually doing for me? Well, a lot, it turns out. Or, at least, it’s trying to. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-just-not-excited-about-the-galaxy-s25-ultra">Samsung didn’t make hardware changes</a> this year, which I’m still a little bummed about. However, with all the focus on AI, it now feels like Samsung is trying to turn the Galaxy S series into its very own Pixels.</p><p>Out of the box, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> is just a click away with a long press of the power button. While I don't care for this method of evoking an AI assistant (it's a power button, let's keep it that way), it emphasizes Samsung and Google's strong partnership to bring the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-gains-new-android-share-screen-shortcut">latest and greatest of Gemini</a> first to the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>One thing I appreciate about the Pixel is that it seems to want to make your life easier by putting the AI features you <em>might</em> want right at your fingertips. That's what I feel Samsung has been working towards since debuting Galaxy AI on the S24 series, and it's even more prevalent with the S25 Plus just how much it wants to be a Pixel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V4cgUPaWVooKBfWLvALCN5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-Audio-Eraser" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus Audio Eraser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4cgUPaWVooKBfWLvALCN5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Drawing Assist got an upgrade, which basically turns it into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a>, allowing you to create or alter images from drawings or text. AI Select is essentially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> without the search, letting you extract content from your screen to perform various actions like editing an image, translating text, creating a GIF, and more.</p><p>Audio Eraser is Samsung’s version of Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Magic Audio Eraser</a>, which analyzes a video to let you remove certain sounds. In my limited use of Audio Eraser on some videos I took over New Year's Eve with another phone, the feature works shockingly well, removing very loud music so that I could only hear my voice in the clips.</p><p>Then there's the Now Bar and Now Brief. These two features I'm most intrigued by, and I feel like there's quite a bit of potential there, even if they don't quite live up to it yet. Now Bar acts like a bottom-mounted Dynamic Island, which shows music controls, timers, live sports scores, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-prepares-one-ui-7-wider-rollout">Google Maps directions</a>. It should act as a pretty handy way to interact with apps directly from your lock screen, although so far, my interactions with it have been limited, and it's not quite as useful a feature as I had hoped.</p>

<p>The same goes for Now Brief, which also appears in the Now Bar during certain times of the day (or you can set a widget on your home screen). It's basically a summary of your morning, afternoon, and evening, which should recall various information based on your health stats, calendar, and more, almost like Morning Brief on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, while I get some of that info, the briefs aren't as insightful or informative as I would like, showing me the weather, upcoming calendar events, and suggesting Spotify songs to me. I still have not seen any health stats appear in my brief despite actively using Samsung Health. I also wish it was more proactive at showing me my briefs outside of the lock screen, perhaps with a notification.</p><p>Still, I see where Samsung is going with these features, and they have a lot of potential. I imagine the Now Bar will feel more useful when it gains more support from third-party apps, and I'm hoping I'll get more out of Now Brief after I use the phone more.</p>

<p>While I couldn't be less impressed with how little Samsung upgraded the Galaxy S25 Plus hardware, I'm surprisingly enjoying the phone more than I expected to. It’s nappy, the software feels quite polished, and the Navy hue is the only color worth getting. So far, it feels like the Pixel phone I've always wanted.</p><p>I don't love everything, from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-one-change-almost-ruined-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-for-me">unnecessary changes with lock screen notifications</a> to the seeming removal of the swipe gesture to evoke the assistant. Samsung also has some odd choices for default settings that I find a little questionable.</p><p>That said, there's still quite a bit that I want to test out more thoroughly, including the cameras, battery life, overall performance, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">Qi2 MagSafe charging</a> (provided I get my hands on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-cases">Galaxy S25 Plus case</a> that supports MagSafe). You can look forward to all of this and more in my full review of the Galaxy S25 Plus.</p>

As evidenced by the 3,000+ words from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on</a>, I clearly came out on the other side with more than a few thoughts. Fast forward to now, and I've been using the Galaxy S25 Ultra for about a week, but for some reason, I'm kind of at an impasse.</p><p>I can't help but feel as though I was looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> through Samsung's rose-tinted (or blue) glasses. Everything that was announced and demoed sounded wonderful, and in that initial two-ish hours, it was. I was excited about the chance to try out the obvious front-runner for the best Android phone of the year. And I was even more excited about the various Gemini and Galaxy AI-powered improvements that were promised.</p><p>Over the past week, there have been quite a few things that I've noticed and a few things that I would have forgotten about if it weren't for my RSS feeds and social media.</p>

<h2 id="the-good-2">The good</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hanx7EejjunZdapcxYhb43" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-iphone-16-pro-max-galaxy-z-fold-6-galaxy-s24-ultra-angled-profile-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with S24 Ultra, Z Fold 6, and iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hanx7EejjunZdapcxYhb43.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Maybe it's just because I'm used to the iPhone's design, but I actually rather like what Samsung has done with the S25 Ultra. I don't know if I like it more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-galaxy-s24-ultra">S24 Ultra</a>, but at the very least, it's kind of refreshing to see Samsung largely use the same design language across <em>all</em> of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">its flagship phones</a>. That includes the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6.</p><p>I've always been a sucker for a good metal and glass sandwich, and the S25 Ultra easily checks the box. Using a phone that matches the price tag isn't always a foregone conclusion, but I still have to give credit where it's due.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4FkKSraWWVK96gkRReyk73" name="samsung-ecosystem-galaxy-s25-ultra-1" alt="Samsung ecosystem of devices including the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy Watch Ultra, Buds 3 Pro, Samsung laptop, and Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4FkKSraWWVK96gkRReyk73.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else that I've thoroughly enjoyed is re-entering the Samsung ecosystem. Before the S25 Ultra landed on my doorstep, I managed to snag the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> for around $200 thanks to a random trade-in promotion. And seeing as I was already getting the itch for some new earbuds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> were quickly added to my cart.</p><p>A few years ago, I probably would've been one of the first to mock Samsung's attempts at imitating Apple. Now, I'm actually just grateful that the ecosystem pretty much just works. There are a few hiccups that aren't related to the S25 Ultra specifically, but I'll have thoughts on that in an upcoming article. If anything, it proved just how important having an ecosystem of products that seamlessly work together can be.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9pjQQ9MnKErHsv2WUmiBV7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-morning-now-brief" alt="Morning Now Brief on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9pjQQ9MnKErHsv2WUmiBV7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you read my initial impressions, then you probably noticed that I couldn't shut up about AI. I'm going to save most of my opinions for the final review, but I have to point out how much I've actually enjoyed having the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-lock-screen-keeps-you-in-the-loop-on-sports-and-directions">Now Brief</a> widget on my home screen. It's become part of my daily routine, as I tap the widget, and it updates throughout the day just to see what will show up.</p><p>Having certain bits of information presented to me is really nice, especially for someone who slightly obsesses over how much sleep they get. Amplifying this "issue" is the Energy Score from the Watch Ultra, but that's not actually a bad thing. It just feeds into my obsession as I look forward to seeing what kind of suggestions for improvements are made.</p>
<h2 id="the-annoying-2">The annoying</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y9SzGeErJAPgA6XF5Ren63" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-now-brief-news" alt="Now Brief News on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y9SzGeErJAPgA6XF5Ren63.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For as quickly as Now Brief has quickly become part of my daily routine, it also didn't take long to realize one of its pitfalls. Near the bottom of the page, you're occasionally presented with news that "you might be interested in." However, no matter what I've tried to do, it only ever recommends news that I couldn't care less about.</p><p>I thought that it might be something to do with the Samsung News app despite never actually using it. So I went through and tried to prune the topics, but that doesn't seem to have done anything. Instead, my Now Brief dashboard still manages to show me the "wrong" news.</p><p>Before you ask, yes, I double-checked the Now Brief settings, as there's a "Content to include" section. Unfortunately, you can't change any of the topics from here and can only enable or disable the "News" from showing up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="acMY653XDcyhFGGfH8nTWE" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-case-options-3" alt="Various cases for the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/acMY653XDcyhFGGfH8nTWE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as design goes, I appreciate the Galaxy S25 Ultra's redesign, but there's one nagging issue. See, for the first couple of days after getting the S25 Ultra, I didn't have a case for it. I'm not much of a case guy anyway, with the exception of using either a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-should-you-wait">Fiberborne (formerly Thinborne) case</a> or a Dbrand skin.</p><p>However, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is so slippery that I was constantly worried that the phone was going to slip out of my hands. Between that and seeing that a few of Samsung's first-party cases are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/quick-a-bunch-of-galaxy-s25-cases-are-50-percent-off-at-best-buy-but-the-sale-wont-last-long">50% off at Best Buy</a>, I ended up grabbing a couple of them. Unfortunately, none of my local Best Buy stores had the "Ultra Clear Magnet Case," so I opted for the Silicone, Kindsuit, and Standing Grip cases.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87" name="magsafe-ring-adapter-silicone-case-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Silicone Case with MagSafe ring and PopSocket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This leads me to another annoyance, as I really wish Samsung would have adopted the magnetic portion of the Qi2 protocol. It's cool and all that the S25 series is the first to support the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">Qi 2.1 standard</a>, but I don't actually care about the charging speeds aspect. What I do care about is being able to use one of the myriad of MagSafe accessories that I've accrued over the years, and not being able to is just disappointing.</p><p>As a result, I opted to slap a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe adapter ring</a> to the back of the Silicone case, just so I could use a PopSocket. Maybe this is what Samsung is hoping for because if the S25 Ultra had the appropriate magnets, I probably wouldn't have bothered to buy a case. I mean, why would I consider that using a PopSocket would have given me some peace of mind to use the phone without a case?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pF4iWv9zWpuHWZvJosppB7" name="manage-storage-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Manage Storage on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra surrounded by microSD cards and portable SSDs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pF4iWv9zWpuHWZvJosppB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, I've been a bit frustrated when it comes to trying to use emulators on the S25 Ultra. Samsung isn't to blame for part of my frustration, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> just hasn't been out long enough for higher-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulators</a> to be properly optimized. For the most part, Switch and Winlator emulation is at the mercy of the stock drivers, which are frankly lackluster.</p><p>I'm working on something a bit more in-depth surrounding emulation on Android, but again, that's not Samsung's problem.</p><p>Something that has been gnawing away at me is that Samsung went on stage and talked about how the S25 Ultra has a "40% larger" vapor chamber for cooling. That's truly wonderful for mobile gaming in general, but the whole time I'm just thinking about the Apple-like storage constraints.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A3Kco8nfDjnF5wtVTQ5YE7" name="switch-emulation-galaxy-s25-ultra-ayaneo-pocket-dmg-1" alt="Switch emulation on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and AYANEO Pocket DMG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A3Kco8nfDjnF5wtVTQ5YE7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having 256GB as the base configuration is great and all, but the only way to get more is by shelling out more cash to Samsung. It's also great that Samsung is basically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">giving you a storage upgrade for free</a> during the pre-order phase. But that doesn't do anything for those who missed the window or just can't upgrade right now.</p><p>So, for someone who has an ever-growing library of ROMs and DRM-free games for Winlator, 256GB just isn't enough. For example, at this moment, I have less than 40GB of space left on the S25 Ultra. That might seem like a lot, but in reality, that will be gone in no time as I take more pictures with my son's first birthday around the corner.</p><p>I guess what I want to see is for Samsung to release an "Ultra" that spares no expense. The Galaxy S25 Ultra gets about 95% of the way there, but what's holding it back from releasing a "Special Edition" model that brings back the BLE S Pen and includes a microSD card slot?</p>

<p>Without a shadow of a doubt, the S Pen "debacle" has made me just want to avoid social media and my RSS feeds more than anything else. It's been a week and there's already so much "outrage" that it's simply pathetic. Samsung removed BLE from the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mixed-reports-about-a-separate-bluetooth-s-pen-for-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-have-fans-puzzled">based on the response</a>, you might've thought Samsung took away the headphone jack again.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I understand the potential arguments. Samsung shouldn't be removing any features from a phone that starts at $1,200. And if you were one of the few that did use Air Commands, then it probably feels like some sort of betrayal.</p><p>Samsung didn't do itself any favors either. While the reasons were explained in my hands-on session, there was no mention of it during Galaxy Unpacked. Then, we watched as conflicting reports suggested the S25 Ultra would work with some unannounced BLE-enabled S Pen, only for others to suggest they wouldn't.</p>

<p>I spent more than an hour messing around with the multitude of S Pens that I could find, trying to figure out an answer. Only to come to a rather weird, yet semi-helpful, conclusion — technically you can use other S Pens with the S25 Ultra, but you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">can't use Air Actions</a>, and they first have to be paired with another Galaxy device that is signed into the same Samsung account as your S25 Ultra.</p><p>Adding more fuel to the fire is that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-retracts-previous-bluetooth-s-pen-references-galaxy-s25-ultra">took Samsung several days</a> to even provide some official guidance. In that time, there have been numerous articles, and apparently, there's even a petition going around to bring BLE back to the S Pen. It's just been mind-numbing and I fear that it will only pick up once the S25 Ultra is in the hands of more people than just reviewers and influencers.</p>

<p>After seeing how I felt following my hands-on session, I actually thought that the S25 Ultra might be able to replace my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-max">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. And since coming into my possession, it's actually been able to do that for everything besides phone calls and text messages.</p><p>The design is fantastic and just looks stunning, even with how slippery it is. Emulation woes aside, performance has been exactly what I hoped it would be, and I'm able to make it through an entire day (and then some) before even thinking about battery life. I'm also excited to see what kind of changes and improvements Samsung will bring to the on-device AI and Now Brief features.</p><p>Perhaps more surprising than anything is that I'm contemplating jumping in on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">pre-order bonanza</a> and snagging a 1TB model. Mainly because I want to see what it's like to go back to the "one phone" lifestyle, which would mean moving my SIM card out of the iPhone and into the S25 Ultra. And this is the first non-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> that has managed to really move that needle at all for me.</p>

Of course, modern e-paper devices are so much more than that. Onyx Boox is a brand that has worked hard at excelling in this category, defeating the likes of the Amazon Kindle for the throne.</p><p>The Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C is a colorized and updated iteration of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-note-air-3-review">Onyx Boox Note Air 3</a>, reviewed by my colleague Harish Jonnalagadda. The Note Air 3 has a colorized version called the Onyx Boox Note Air 3 C, which begs the question, why should you buy the newer, more expensive model?</p><p>As with any new release, the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C has upgraded internals and software. After using it for a few months, I have some thoughts about the Note Air 4 C. Let's dive into the details.</p>

<h2 id="there-s-a-new-color-onyx-boox-in-town-and-it-s-as-sleek-as-ever-2">There's a new color Onyx Boox in town and it's as sleek as ever</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3928px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2XywHTenWDXHuFVKpWicUh" name="Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C e-reader" alt="Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C e-reader" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2XywHTenWDXHuFVKpWicUh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3928" height="2209" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Onyx Boox stays busy, launching new models of its black & white as well as colored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">E Ink tablets</a> loaded with Android every few months. The Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C was released on October 23, 2024. Interestingly, there is no grayscale Note Air 4 to go with the 4 C.</p><p>You can purchase the Note Air 4 C for $499.99 from Onyx Boox's website or retailers like Amazon. It comes with a stylus in the box and a charging cable, but the accompanying Note Air 4 C Cover needs to be bought separately for another $50.99.</p>
<p>Onyx Boox outfitted the Note Air 4C with an upgraded Kaleido 3 color E Ink panel which delivers better brightness and contrast levels, as well as a higher screen refresh rate. The 10.3-inch e-paper display has an anti-glare layer on top and a Wacom layer to support the included EMR stylus.</p>

<p>Design wise, the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C looks exactly the same as the last-gen Note Air 3 C. Both e-readers are equally slim at lightweight, measuring 226mm x 193mm x 5.8mm in size and coming in at a lightweight 430 grams.</p>
<p>To make you understand just how sleek this thing is, I compared it to the brand-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Next to this slim and trim e-ink tablet, the S25 Ultra looks chunky. It's amazing, considering this is an older design, whereas Samsung's flagship phone is hot out of the oven and hasn't even started shipping yet.</p>

<p>There are no physical buttons apart from the power button. The microSD card slot is still located in the spine of the tablet, along with the USB-C port for 15W wired charging. You can also use a USB-C thumb drive with the Note Air 4 C as it supports USB-C OTG.</p>
<p>Sadly, there's no ingress protection yet again this year, so you have to be super careful when handling the Note Air 4 C near liquids and grainy solid particles.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C has a speedier octa-core chipset and beefier 6GB RAM, adding 2GB to the Note Air 3 C's 4GB of RAM. The result is noticeably improved performance, fewer instances of ghosting, and better loading times in general. It's still nowhere near as snappy as a full-blown Android tablet, of course, but it's one of the fastest e-paper tablets that money can buy right now.</p><p>Boosted internals go hand in hand with newer software. The Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C comes with Android 13 installed out of the box as opposed to the Note Air 3 C, which came with Android 12. This might seem old seeing as we are on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> in the smartphone sector now. But for e-readers, that's quite advanced. Not to mention, Onyx Boox promises to deliver at least three years of firmware updates to all of its devices. Most Boox tabs probably get more than that.</p>

<p>The biggest draw with an Onyx Boox e-reader is that you get unfettered access to Android apps, and the Play Store is pre-installed. Amazon blocks this ability on all Kindle e-readers, limiting what you can do with a Kindle to a great extent. The Note Air 4 is ripe with possibilities. You can try installing any Android app in the sun. Even if it's incompatible, you can tweak and optimize it using Onyx Boox's built-in customizability tools.</p><p>The NeoReader is a fantastic e-book app with extensive tools and options baked in. Note-taking is also a treat on the Note Air 4 C, thanks to Boox's Notes app, which has OCR built-in so that you can convert hand-written notes on the fly. Onyx Boox offers so many useful reading and writing functions that it's hard to list out everything.</p><p>Like every other tech brand, Onyx Boox has also hopped aboard the AI bandwagon. You get neat AI features pre-loaded on the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C, such as the Boox AI Assistant and AI Read. This makes the NeoReader more intelligent than ever before.</p>

<p>There are plenty of e-readers out there, but very few can do what the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C can. If you don't care about Android smarts and just want a cheap e-reader for nothing but reading, the most straightforward answer is a cheap <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-2022-review">Amazon Kindle</a>.</p><p>Other competing brands include Bigme, Kobo, and Pocketbook. However, none of these companies have e-readers that run Android 13, come with color displays, and consistently receive software updates.</p><p>Ironically, if you're looking for a cheaper alternative, the most suitable option comes from Onyx Boox themselves. The smaller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/boox-palma-2-note-air4-c-launch-details">Boox Palma 2 launched alongside the Note Air 4 C</a> and costs only $279.99. It features a 6.13-inch E Ink Carta 1200 display that only outputs shades of black and white. The nifty little Palma 2 has many of the smarts of the 4 C despite its stature, and it one-ups the larger tab thanks to its splash-proof design.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3699px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="f7cux64wG4Pn2ZopzMLhNh" name="Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C e-reader" alt="Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C e-reader" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7cux64wG4Pn2ZopzMLhNh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3699" height="2081" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the latest processor and higher RAM</li><li>You want a versatile e-reader for note-taking</li><li>You're a student or someone who needs to write a lot</li><li>You want a colorful e-reader</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy it if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need ingress protection like water-resistance and dust-proofing</li><li>Your budget is extremely tight</li></ul>
<p>As much as I love the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C, almost $500 is a hefty price to pay for such a niche device. It's a wonderful e-reader that's perfect for note-taking, with no limitations and unrestricted access to Android apps via the Play Store. However, everything that I love about this tablet overlaps with the Onyx Boox Note Air 3 C.</p><p>Frankly speaking, beyond the menial hardware upgrade such as the faster processor and newer Bluetooth chip, there's not a lot there to justify buying the Note Air 4 C over its predecessor. You can score the Note Air 3 C for $50 less and it still gets the same firmware upgrades as the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C.</p><p>If Android 13 is of great importance to you, the newer Boox e-reader makes sense. But in most cases, I'd suggest opting for the older Note Air 3 C instead. Make no mistake, the Onyx Boox Note Air 4 C is a spectacular device. It's just that it doesn't add much over the last-gen 3 C, at least not enough to justify a $50 price difference.</p>

<ul><li>There is a new version of Pixel Camera available for download on Pixel phones.</li><li>A patch update of Pixel Camera version 9.7 is rolling out now via the Google Play Store.</li><li>The update appears to include no new features, and instead builds off the earlier v9.7 update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is making a new version of the Pixel Camera app available for download through the Google Play Store; however, the update appears to be a small patch with bug fixes based on the existing Pixel Camera app version 9.7 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-camera-9-7-patch-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The new version of the Pixel Camera app carries a version number of <strong>9.7.047.710329721.21</strong>, and replaces version <strong>9.7.047.702121536.18</strong>. It has a download size of 574 megabytes, though the update will of course be smaller if you already have the app installed on your Pixel phone. The Google Play Store <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera" target="_blank">listing</a> for Pixel Camera confirms that it was last updated today, Jan. 30, 2025.</p><p>The update is widely becoming available for all eligible Pixel phones, including the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a>. There are no new features listed in the changelog for the app, and there are no visible changes after installing the update. As such, this is almost certainly a minor patch with either bug fixes or security patches, or both.</p><p>Most recently, version 9.7 of the Pixel Camera app added a few new features. The update re-introduced manual controls for certain camera settings, like brightness, white balance, and shadows. This is through a new <strong>Quick access</strong> controls section that you can tap from the Pixel Camera viewfinder. This reverses a change made with version 9.1 of the Pixel Camera app that made these controls more difficult to access.</p><p>In other news, v9.7 also added Dual Screen Portrait Mode for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and Pixel Fold. The earlier version 9.6 added an underwater mode, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">easier astrophotography mode access</a>, and vertical panoramas.</p><p>You can install the latest Pixel Camera update via the Google Play Store now.</p>

<ul><li>Google appears to have a Find My Device app for Wear OS in the works.</li><li>A version of the app was spotted in a five-month-old promotional video for the Pixel Watch 3.</li><li>The app could be released in a future Pixel Feature Drop, Wear OS 5.1, or alongside a future Pixel Watch model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google appears to have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/find-my-device">Find My Device app</a> for Wear OS in the works, as evidenced by a frame hidden in a Google Pixel Watch 3 promotional video that first aired five months ago. The ad, surfaced by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1ie8crp/find_my_device_for_watch_shown_in_official_pixel/#lightbox" target="_blank">a Reddit user</a>, shows a Find My Device app optimized for Wear OS with a map and more (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/31/find-my-device-pixel-watch-app/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Despite the video airing so long ago, we haven't heard much about a Wear OS version of the Find My Device app since.</p><p>Most of the apps showcased in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLAC75BeGjI&t=17s" target="_blank">video</a>, called "<strong>Meet Google Pixel Watch 3 | Big Screen, Bigger Strides</strong>," are showcasing apps and functionality we've seen before. There is a Nest Doorbell look-in video feed and a TV remote control panel, both of which are new to the Pixel Watch 3. There are also Pixel Watch staples, like playback controls for now-playing media and Fitbit app integration.</p><p>However, the final app screen in this specific frame shows an unreleased app with a map, the date and time a device was last seen, a button to play a sound on the device, and the device's battery life. While not specifically named, this app appears to be a version of Find My Device made specifically for the Pixel Watch 3.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1ie8crp/find_my_device_for_watch_shown_in_official_pixel">Find My Device for Watch shown in Official Pixel Watch 3 commercial?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch">r/PixelWatch</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Pixel Watch wearables can already be used to play a sound with a companion Pixel phone. It's possible that the app snippet shown in the video is an expansion of this existing feature, but it's more likely that it is a sneak peek at a native Find My Device app for Wear OS. Aside from adding a map with more location details, a Find My Device app would enable users to see the location of their earbuds, tablets, and other compatible products.</p><p>One Reddit user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1ie8crp/comment/ma7jha0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">shared</a> that it is possible to sideload the Android version of Find My Device onto a Pixel Watch, though it isn't the easiest to navigate.</p><p>It's unclear when the Find My Device app for Wear OS might become available for Pixel Watch users, or users of other Wear OS watches. Google hasn't acknowledged the development of this app outside of a quick appearance in this Pixel Watch 3 debut ad. It's possible that it makes an appearance in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-december-feature-drop-for-pixel-watch-lets-you-peek-at-nest-cameras-from-your-wrist">future Pixel Feature Drop</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-wear-os-5-1-preview-is-now-available-and-its-based-on-android-15">Wear OS 5.1</a>, or alongside a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">future Pixel Watch model</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google has taken to the blog machine to tell us how Gemini is being used to commit crimes. Not just any crimes but even state-level World War-inducing crimes. Nobody should be surprised.</p><p>Google's Threat Intelligence Group has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/adversarial-misuse-generative-ai/">written a white paper</a> outlining the various ways serious abuses and intelligence threats were committed using its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">generative AI platform Gemini.</a> The list of abusers includes names you already thought of — Iran, North Korea, China, and more. If you find this sort of thing interesting like I do and don't mind Googling a few nerd terms to help it all make sense, you should read it.</p>
<p>Everyone should have expected this. AI has been developed to do plenty of things, and it's doing plenty of those things for both good and bad reasons. Iran, for example, used Gemini to research Western defense organizations, conduct reconnaissance, and try to phish data from defense employees. North Korea used it to see how it could attack infrastructure and steal cryptocurrency. Russia leaned heavily on Gemini for malware development.</p><p>This is all possible because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini was trained</a> to know as much about these things as it could. That can be helpful, even aiding in defending against state-sponsored cybercrime. It can also be harmful because people — even the people in charge of spy stuff for other countries — want to see what they can get away with.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2977px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="P7fJN82FZJUCYXBfTveGaB" name="Google-Werewolf-GDC-2024-panel-1.jpeg" alt="A slide during the GDC 2024 panel "Simulacra and Subterfuge: Building Agentic 'Werewolf'". It shows the text "Generative Werewolf" and avatars for LLM bots." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P7fJN82FZJUCYXBfTveGaB.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2977" height="1675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google found over 42 different groups of people using Gemini to craft some sort of attack against Western countries and the people who live in them. That tells me it didn't find hundreds of other groups. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-one-year-later">Generative AI is just too easy to use</a> for things like this, and that can't be ignored.</p><p>This isn't going to go away on its own, and it will only get worse. Using an AI like Gemini to find a way to recon the enemy or attack public infrastructure is a lot easier than putting people in the field to do either. AI is excellent at coding tasks and doesn't care if it's writing "Hello World" or an exploit to disable a bridge. AI also makes it easy — too easy — to impersonate anyone or anything to gain some sort of an advantage.</p><p>I'm not interested in a life of crime, and I assume you aren't either. But if we were, we could use AI to make it all so much easier.</p>

<hr>
<p>Users have started reporting an interesting development for Google's recent Pixel series and satellite messaging.</p><p>Reports have appeared in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1iduk3a/just_got_the_starlink_beta_text_on_a_pixel_9_pro/">a thread on Reddit</a>, stating a few Pixel 9 devices have been granted entry to T-Mobile's Starlink satellite messaging beta (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-9-t-mobile-starlink-beta-satellite-messaging-3522100/">Android Authority</a>). The original poster (OP) posted a screenshot of a text received on their Pixel 9 Pro that says they've entered the beta. Messages have been going out over the past week or so, per user comments.</p><p>Some users (like the OP) have received access on a Pixel 9 Pro, another user reported access on their Pixel 9 Pro XL; however, the experience isn't all the same.</p><p>Ensuring your device is up-to-date is recommended as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1iduk3a/comment/ma26mv8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user states</a> they are running Android 15 with the latest Google Play Systems patch. Strangely, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1iduk3a/comment/ma3np3k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">one user claims</a> that they are completely updated, yet their satellite connectivity via Starlink's beta never flipped over. These users are simply seeing their Pixel 9 swap to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/satellite-sos-launches-demo-pixel-9">Google's Satellite SOS services</a>, not Starlink's.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1iduk3a/just_got_the_starlink_beta_text_on_a_pixel_9_pro">Just got the Starlink Beta text on a Pixel 9 Pro</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile">r/tmobile</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Of course, your cellular network provider must be T-Mobile to receive a message about your beta eligibility.</p><p>The timing of this lines up with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile-customers-direct-to-cell-beta-registration">a recent slew of reports</a> from T-Mobile customers stating access to the beta has been slowly arriving. It seems Android and iOS customers have been seeing messages about access to the Starlink satellite messaging beta through T-Mobile. SpaceX's CEO Elon Musk announced that the beta officially began on January 27.</p><p>Satellite messaging through Starlink supports "medium resolution images, music & audio podcasts," in a comment by Musk. With its arrival, T-Mobile states that all of its "postpaid customers" will receive access to this service for free. This will last throughout the testing period, but it may become more "limited" once it's out and into the public.</p><p>Speaking of limited, if you're on a T-Mobile cell plan and would like to test this service, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/satellite-phone-service">you can register now</a>. Keep in mind that, just as when the registration period opened in December, spaces are limited, so act quickly. Once in, your device will automatically connect to Starlink's satellites to keep you in contact with your loved ones if you're too far from T-Mobile's cell towers.</p>

<hr>
<p>Meta seemingly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">found a hit with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, which are the only smart glasses to date to successfully break into pop culture and fashion. However, Meta doesn't share exact sales figures for Ray-Ban Meta glasses. That has made it hard to quantify just how well these Meta smart glasses are selling, until now. In an all-hands meeting with employees seen by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/603674/meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-sales" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg finally revealed how many pairs Meta sold in 2024.</p><p>Zuckerberg revealed that Meta sold over one million units of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> last year. The glasses were first released in October 2023, so this figure doesn't perfectly represent the product's lifetime sales. It does get close, though, and it is certainly impressive for a modern pair of smart glasses.</p><p>"I think one of the questions for us is, are we going to go from 1 million this year to 2 million?," Zuckerberg asked. "Are we going to go from 1 million to 5 million?"</p><p>The Meta chief executive also referenced the company's lead in wearable technology, insinuating that Meta should take advantage of its big lead before others start to catch up.</p><p>"We basically invented the category and our competitors haven’t really shown up yet," Zuckerberg said. "I think we'll probably start seeing some of that maybe a little later this year, maybe next year, but we just have this wide open field right now to run and basically introduce as many people as possible to Meta AI glasses and we should take that opportunity."</p>

<p>Meta appears to be doubling down on smart glasses in the years to come. Per recent reports, the company will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">seed prototype Orion development units to devs</a> ahead of its AR glasses launching for the public. It's also working on a pair of Oakley smart glasses for athletes, and a premium version of Ray-Ban Metas with a heads-up display.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster from Weibo claims the OPPO Find N5 could sport "telephoto macro support," which could roll over onto the OnePlus Open 2.</li><li>Previous rumors claimed the Open 2 could feature a periscope camera, instead, at 50MP, but what's alleged now goes back on that.</li><li>OnePlus had reportedly delayed its foldable successor last year and it's now rumored to drop in Q1 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The hopeful are still awaiting the next OnePlus foldable, but a new leak purports an exciting development for its cameras.</p><p>Rumors from Weibo tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5888095979/Pc0BUFi3v">Smart Pikachu</a> claim that an OPPO Find N5 telephoto advancement could arrive on the OnePlus Open 2 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-open-2-camera-feature-leak-3522083/">Android Authority</a>). The social media post states OPPO's device could boast macro support on its telephoto lens.</p><p>Why this involves the Open 2 is because OnePlus and OPPO and sister companies and the former's devices are usually reworked versions of the latter for global launches.</p><p>As the publication notes, telephoto macro support would aid the OnePlus Open 2's abilities to take highly detailed, close-up shots of a subject from further away. It would feel like using a 100mm macro lens on a traditional camera. In reality, it may give consumers more agency over perfecting their shot without disturbing the scene since they're a ways back.</p><p>The tipster adds that the OPPO Find N5 is "almost ready," which could indicate its launch is coming up. As we know, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oneplus-open-might-not-see-a-successor-this-year">OnePlus Open 2 was supposedly delayed</a> into 2025 — much like OPPO's version — so there's a chance a launch is in the cards in the next few months.</p>

<p>Curiously, we've seen this phone's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2-camera-charging-leaks">camera rumors</a> dip back and forth as one from a few months ago dropped the idea of a telephoto. Originally, speculation claims the Open 2 would see a triple camera array consisting of a 50MP primary lens, a 50MP ultrawide lens, and a 50MP periscope lens. At the time, we mentioned how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">its predecessor</a> has a 64MP telephoto lens — and the idea of one with macro support has now pushed the periscope thought away.</p><p>Those same rumors also purport that the Open 2 could grab wireless charging, something we wished the original had.</p><p>Other supposed specs include a 5,700mAh or a 6,000mAh battery setup for the book-style foldable. Recent chatter adds that the phone could sport a "2K Plus full high-definition," as well.</p><p>OnePlus started teasing the Open 2 recently with a simple photo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-really-hope-the-oneplus-open-2-doesnt-make-the-same-mistake-as-the-pixel-9-pro-fold">showing how thin</a> the device will be. There are some concerns around an overly thin device, like the specifications/features will the OEM have to sacrifice to achieve a slim form factor. Regardless, rumors suggest the device could launch sometime <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-may-have-a-launch-window-lined-up-for-its-next-foldable-phone">in Q1 2025</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Smart glasses may be the fastest-growing tech category in the world today, reaching millions of first-time buyers. Mark Zuckerberg's claim that 2025 will be "a defining year that determines if we're on a path towards many hundreds of millions, and eventually billions of AI glasses" suggests that growth will soon explode beyond its enthusiast niche. But is that likely, or is it another ambitious pipe dream like the "Metaverse?"</p><p>Meta's recent earnings call <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">highlighted the company's massive growth</a>, but the vast majority of its $48 billion quarterly revenue — an $8 billion YoY growth — came from advertising. Reality Labs had a strong $1 billion revenue thanks to the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> and strong <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> sales, but the division still loses about $4–5 billion per year on R&D.</p><p>Zuckerberg once sold these losses to shareholders as the foundation for a worldwide Metaverse, with Meta profiting from XR hardware and the virtual marketplace. Now, he rarely brings up the concept, pivoting to Meta AI as the company's future. And <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>, or AR glasses, will be the "next computing platform" if they invest "hundreds of billions of dollars" in AI infrastructure.</p><p>The Meta CEO's distaste for phones, a 3rd-party platform that takes a 30% cut of his app profits, is well documented. So when he says, "I think we'll have both [phones and glasses] for some time" but that AI glasses will supplant phones eventually, it's a future he's trying to actualize — even if it's "a longer grind" that takes a decade or more to happen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ej8h8ViNkfwuSmYCTuJAe7" name="Mark-Zuckerberg-Meta-Connect-2024" alt="Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Meta Connect 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ej8h8ViNkfwuSmYCTuJAe7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Intentionally or not, Zuckerberg highlighted the biggest problem with this agenda during the earnings call.</p><p>"A lot of people in the world have glasses," he said in answer to a question about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>. "It's hard for me to imagine that a decade or more from now, all the glasses aren't going to basically be AI glasses, as well as a lot of people who don't wear glasses today finding that to be a useful thing."</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161-6420(16)00025-7/fulltext">Ophthalmology journal entry</a> says that about 3 billion people worldwide have myopia, trending toward nearly 4 billion by 2035 and 50% of the world by 2050. Ironically, our global addiction to phones might push more people towards needing glasses, with a larger portion buying smart glasses with AI assistants and holographic tech.</p><p>So the opportunity and audience are there, certainly. But Zuckerberg's quote highlights the two main obstacles to smart glasses becoming commonplace: whether the optometrist offices and Warby Parkers of the world will truly start adding AI to their frames, and whether the other half of the world who <em>don't</em> need glasses — primarily younger folks — will start to wear them and drive popularity with older users.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NcT7mtaz3yfmR7PhfunohW" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Smart-Glasses-front-right-lens.jpeg" alt="A close-up of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses' right lens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NcT7mtaz3yfmR7PhfunohW.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Smart glasses mostly blend in as "normal" glasses, but what about the people who don't like how glasses look to begin with? </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the first subject, Meta has been smart to partner with Ray-Bans and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">Oakley</a>, using their design expertise to appeal to mainstream users and focusing solely on the software and portability of their platform. Can Meta and its partners turn optometrists into evangelists for this tech? I think they need another generation or two of improvement: smart glasses tend to be expensive, heavy, and short-lived with active use, and adding holographic AR tech will only compound the issue.</p><p>As for popularity with the youths, don't ask a millennial. I do know from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/603674/meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-sales">The Verge</a> that Meta sold 1 million Ray-Ban smart glasses last year, while IDC reports that 2.56 million smart glasses were sold across brands in 2024. They predict that number will grow to 6.4 million in 2028, without taking AR glasses into account. Compared to 160 million smartwatches sold in 2028, AI glasses aren't trending toward ubiquity yet, but they're not irrelevant either.</p><p>Though Meta and Zuckerberg may not like it, I wonder if we need Samsung and Apple to enter the market for smart glasses to really take off.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr" target="_blank">Android XR</a> has household name recognition because it'll give you Google Maps directions and Gmail summaries, and it will directly sync to Google Photos; plus, it will likely have partnerships with apps like Spotify. And Apple Glasses would have that synchronicity with iPhones and a much more accessible price tag than the premium Vision Pro, plus similar partnerships with hundreds of core apps and companies.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg concluded his AI glasses musings by admitting, "I still don't know what the long-term trajectory for [smart glasses] is going to be, and I think we're going to learn a lot this year."</p><p>That emphasis on 2025 being a potential turning point for smart glasses is what I'm most curious about. I don't think Meta is going to passively hope for the best; it may announce more glasses partnerships, push new Meta AI apps on its Ray-Bans, or announce AR glasses at Connect that get the ball rolling.</p><p>So whether we see hundreds of millions of smart glasses in the 2030s or not, I'm still enthusiastic about the category's future prospects.</p>

<hr>
<p>Moving into 2025, Samsung is reportedly looking at two key factors to help drive its revenue in the new year.</p><p>Samsung reported its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fy-2024-results">Q4 2024 earnings</a> today (Jan 31), which is giving experts a mixed bag when it comes to previous estimations. The company states it posted 75.8 trillion KRW (Korean Won) in consolidated revenue and 6.5 trillion KRW in operating profits. Samsung adds that while its profits are down quarterly, it achieved the second-highest total annual revenue with 300.9 trillion KRW generated.</p><p>About its drop in profits, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/31/samsung-fourth-quarter-profit-falls-short-of-estimates-as-ai-demand-remains-strong.html">CNBC</a> states that, compared to Q3 2024, Samsung's overall revenue dropped by 4% and its operating profits dipped by 30%. The publication states this could be a cause of "soft market conditions" and the company's "expenditures."</p><p>The company's report expanded on its MX (for mobile) and its Networks businesses, to which it says it generated 25.8 trillion KRW in consolidated and 2.1 trillion KRW in operating profits in Q4. Samsung says the final 2024 quarter saw a dip in its MX side due to the "fading effects" of new flagships — that's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series. However, it states, overall, the year was positive for its MX business as profits saw major growth due to the 2024 flagship trio with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>.</p><p>The Korean OEM's 2025 teaser puts foldables at the forefront as it states it will "strengthen the foldable lineup to generate new customer demand." X tipster Jukanlosreve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1885158723133616365">caught wind of more changes</a> in a Q4 2024 Q&A for foldables, like plans to unveil "foldable products with improved form factors" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-just-teased-whats-next-for-its-galaxy-foldables-in-2025/">Android Police</a>). Durability and a "diversified" lineup for its foldable devices were also mentioned to drive Samsung into 2025.</p><p>On the chip side, Samsung says it has posted 30.1 trillion KRW in consolidated revenue and 2.9 trillion in operating profits — a record-high in the final quarter. The report states that there is "uncertainty" regarding chip demands in Q1 2025; however, there's speculation that a turnaround could happen in Q2.</p>

<p>The foldable aspect for Samsung moving into 2025 is interesting, especially when you consider the Flip 6 and Fold 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-lower-pre-order-numbers">weren't that popular</a>. Compared to the 5 series counterparts, the 2024 foldables only managed 910,000 pre-orders in South Korea, down from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-preorders-break-records-south-korea">a record-shattering</a> 1.02 million pre-orders a year prior.</p><p>Since then, there have been reports that Samsung <em>could </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-unit-shipment-changes-report">slash its foldable shipments</a> this year following a "meh" 2024. The company didn't hit its goals and that could see only 5 million total foldable shipments come from Samsung's kitchen (the Flip 7 could make the vast majority of those units).</p><p>There could be hope as Samsung states in its Q4 2024 report that it will seek to "diversify" its foldables this year with "improved form factors" — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">like a tri-fold</a>? During Unpacked for the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung teased what was coming up. After a brief look at its expected Android XR headset, a familiar device silhouette was spotted that looks exactly like a tri-fold phone.</p><p>Whatever the case may be, we likely won't see these new foldable form factors until later this year, perhaps near the second half.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve been working at Android Central for quite a few years now, but the release of the OnePlus 13 marks the first time that I&apos;ve <em>ever </em>seen a smartphone receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">a 5/5-star rating</a>. Once you get your hands on the device, however, you&apos;ll quickly discover why.</p><p>Straight out of the box, the OnePlus 13 boasts an outstanding 6.8-inch OLED QHD+ display with a durable construction that&apos;s tough enough to withstand a full cycle in the dishwasher (I&apos;m not being hyperbolic — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/Pl5QVUadfbs"><strong>we actually tested it</strong></a>). Things are just as impressive under the hood, as the phone comes with the new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor (the same chipset that powers the S25 series), along with 12GB of RAM and all the latest Oxygen OS 15 software features. You also get some great battery life and charging speeds, while the flagship&apos;s camera tech could easily rival the best phones from Samsung or Google. </p><p>On the other hand, the OnePlus 13 isn&apos;t without a few faults. You don&apos;t get quite as many AI features as you would with the S25 Ultra, the software support isn&apos;t quite as extensive, and there&apos;s no stylus support. You&apos;ll also want to check with your wireless carrier to make sure that it supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>.</p>

The S25 Ultra does not support a BLE S Pen which means you can't enable Air Actions by simply using a Bluetooth S Pen from the older model.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="missing-bluetooth-functionality-in-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-s-pen-caused-a-huge-uproar-among-fans-2">Missing Bluetooth functionality in the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen caused a huge uproar among fans</h2>
<p>It's funny how one little missing feature that less than 1% of users actually used (according to Samsung), caused such a big hullabaloo online. We all knew that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> dropped Bluetooth functionality from its S Pen. This seemed to disappoint many fans of the feature called Air Actions, which let you navigate the menus, snap a photo, and control other actions with just a press of the S Pen's button and a few gestures, without ever touching the display.</p><p>Then came a blog post on Samsung Business Insights which seemed to suggest that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mixed-reports-about-a-separate-bluetooth-s-pen-for-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-have-fans-puzzled">new version of the S Pen</a> would be available that would bring back Bluetooth functionality. This reignited hopes that the S25 Ultra could get Air Actions after all, but this was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-retracts-previous-bluetooth-s-pen-references-galaxy-s25-ultra">swiftly debunked</a> by none other than Samsung itself who quietly removed all mention of this separate S Pen from its blog post. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> even if it lacks this small perk from the previous model.</p>

<p>While using the S24 Ultra's S Pen as a remote shutter is a cool party trick, I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">don't think it really matters</a> in the grand scheme of things. By removing Bluetooth functionality from the S Pen, we got a lighter stylus and that's something many will appreciate. The S Pen Fold Edition for the Galaxy Z Fold series didn't have Bluetooth either, and I don't recall there being a big hue and cry about that.</p><p>On the matter of using the S24 Ultra's S Pen with the S25 Ultra, the basic functionality should still work. Remember that the S25 Ultra won't be able to charge the S Pen from the S24 Ultra because the new model doesn't have that tech built-in. It's understandable why people are so confused because Samsung's messaging hasn't been exactly clear. Even right now, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS10004602/">support page</a> for the S25 Ultra's S Pen explicitly highlights this message, "Air actions are not available with the Galaxy S25 Ultra S Pen." This leaves room for interpretation that there might be an optional/ upcoming S Pen that could support Air Actions."</p>

<ul><li>Google has announced a new voluntary exit program for U.S. employees that come under the Platform and Devices group.</li><li>The teams behind Pixels and Android now have the option to voluntarily quit their roles, if they want to.</li><li>They are also offered a severance package as part of the exit program.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has announced a new voluntary exit program for employees who are part of the Platforms and Devices group — the same teams that are behind Pixel hardware and Android software.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-android-voluntary-exit-employees/">9to5Google</a>, SVP Rick Osterloh sent a corresponding memo to the employees on Thursday (Jan 30) morning, and the search giant has further confirmed the publication.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.85%;"><img id="BoV9pa72WM6mD9NATmJko3" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-1-21x9.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review hero 21x9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BoV9pa72WM6mD9NATmJko3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="857" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This comes after the aforementioned teams were merged into one division last year. The said “voluntary exit program” is applicable for U.S. employees only for services like Android Auto, Android TV, Wear OS, and the recent Android XR platform alongside a wide range of Google and Chrome products, which all come under the same group.</p><p>The search giant is also offering a severance package for the new program. Here’s a statement from the memo, acquired by 9to5:</p><p>“The Platforms & Devices team is offering a voluntary exit program that provides US-based Googlers working on this team the ability to voluntarily leave the company with a severance package. This comes after we brought two large organizations together last year. There’s tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.”</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that the program does not align with any changes to the product roadmap and is also not available to the entire organization, only to the employees in the U.S., as mentioned.</p><p>Considering Google’s handling of previous layoffs, this is a convenient move from the company as it allows employees to exit voluntarily. Since the merger of the hardware and software teams last year, employees are believed to have a better idea of their roles now. They may decide whether to stay "deeply committed" or move out—only they now have a convenient option to consider.</p>

<p>When it comes to upgrading an Android phone, it’s easy to get stuck in your ways. “I have always had a Samsung Galaxy phone and I want to stick with it.” That’s something we hear often. But the latest alternatives are giving Samsung a run for its money. This isn’t to say you shouldn’t get a Samsung Galaxy phone as your next snazzy device. The brand continues to make fantastic phones. But when looking at the Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. OnePlus 13, you might find yourself wondering if it’s time for a switch.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-oneplus-13-the-design-and-basic-features-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. OnePlus 13: The design and basic features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="TnSftznBShisVRkjYUY3S5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-display-lock-screen-01" alt="Customizing the lock screen in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnSftznBShisVRkjYUY3S5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the larger phone in the new Samsung Galaxy S25 line, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus measures 6.7 inches with a 3,120 x 1,440 QHD+ dynamic AMOLED 2x screen. It affords a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate and Vision Booster that ensures the screen is viewable in even bright sunlight.</p><p>Available in Silver Shadow, Navy, Ice Blue, and Mint finishes, the frame is made of armor aluminum and the screen of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. It boasts an IP68 rating so it can withstand both dust and water immersion. Nicholas Sutrich says in his hands-on of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> that he appreciates the curved corners that make it comfortable to hold along with the fact that it’s lighter in weight than the previous generation Galaxy S24 Plus.</p><p>You can get the phone with either 256GB or 512GB storage. It’s not expandable, so you’ll have to rely on cloud storage or offloading content if you need more. You’re best to save up for the 512GB version just in case.</p><p>The phone has a 4,900mAh battery and it supports 45W Super Fast Charging 2.0 along with fast wireless charging 2.0 and Wireless PowerShare. It has an ultrasonic fingerprint reader on the screen, 2D facial recognition, and a new security feature called post-quantum cryptography that is designed to further safeguard your personal data.</p><p>Samsung continues with its promise to offer extended support for the Galaxy S25 Plus: you get seven years of OS and security updates, so the phone will not only last far beyond as long as you want it, but it will also have great resale, trade-in, and hand-me-down value.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yvL4fzCNNRMgcc6cCBh9FN" name="oneplus-13-display-home-screen-03" alt="A customized home screen on the OnePlus 13 with a mountain wallpaper from the Backdrops app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yvL4fzCNNRMgcc6cCBh9FN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By comparison, the OnePlus 13 has a larger 6.82-inch LTPO OLED Aqua Touch screen bosting 3,168 x 1,440 resolution, 1,600 nits brightness (4,500 nits peak brightness), and dynamic 1-120Hz refresh rate. The screen also includes Intelligent Eye Care 4.0 to help reduce strain on your eyes. Sutrich says in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">his review of the OnePlus 13</a> that it’s “the best display of any phone on the market,” easy to see in direct sunlight, which he tested on a beach in The Bahamas.</p><p>The Aqua Touch screen is designed to allow you to easily manipulate the phone even if your hands are wet or there are water droplets on the screen. This could be a game-changer for those who live in rainy or snowy climates, or for use in the field. It also has a Glove Mode for operating it even while wearing thin gloves.</p><p>Available in Midnight Ocean, Black Eclipse, and Arctic Dawn finishes, the screen is made of the company’s Crystal Shield super-ceramic glass. Visually, Sutrich calls it the “most beautiful phone I’ve ever used” (referencing the blue vegan leather model he was given for review). OnePlus, for its part, says the Ceramic Guard screen offers better scratch and drop protection than Gorilla Glass.</p><p>A stand-out feature is that the phone supports both the IP68 and IP69 ratings, which means it can not only withstand dust and be submerged, it can also withstand high-pressure water jets. This means you can take it on a boat, while jet skiing, or even literally toss it in the dishwasher and it will purportedly come out unscathed. In fact, Sutrich tested this theory, running it through a sanitizing cycle on his dishwasher for four hours, then taking it into a sauna and it continues to work just fine.</p><p>A bit heavier and thicker than the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus given its larger size, Sutrich finds the flat side rails on the front and back with the curved edge of this phone makes it easy and comfortable to hold. It comes with the same 256GB or 512GB storage capacities, so make sure to get the bigger one and look into cloud storage options if you think you’ll need more.</p><p>The battery is another stand-out here: it has a massive 6,000mAh battery and, like other OnePlus phones, lasts an incredibly long time. It also supports 80W (yes, you read that correctly!) SUPERVOOC charging, with the charger in the box (yay!) You can increase this to up to 100W with OnePlus’ SUPERVOOC 100W dual-port power adapter, which is sold separately. It also supports 50W AIRVOOC wireless charging. Again, you read that correctly. So, this phone not only lasts a long time, at least a few days per charge, but it recharges at blazing speeds.</p><p>“I am constantly surprised when I plug it in for 10 or 15 minutes,” says Sutrich, “and see that it’s already in the 80% range…If you’ve never used a OnePlus phone before, you’re going to be absolutely blown away by not only how good the battery life is, but also by how fast it charges. It puts every leading flagship phone to shame.”</p><p>While there’s no Qi2 support without a case, whereas the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus does offer built-in Qi2 support, OnePlus does offer a wide range of cases with Qi2 support and appears to be one of the only phone brands, if not <em>the</em> only phone brand, to be doing so. You’ll need a case either way, of course, but it’s worth noting.</p><p>The phone has traditional security features, like an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on the screen, but nothing specific that will blow you away. Ongoing support is not as robust in comparison to Samsung, as you’ll only get four major Android updates and security updates for six years. But that’s still impressive.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-oneplus-13-the-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. OnePlus 13: The specs</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-vs-oneplus-what-can-these-phones-do-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. OnePlus: What can these phones do?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TMRESzEBxjtH3UiNPSVnQ7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-AI-select-01" alt="Using AI Select on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus to get context-sensitive actions from an image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TMRESzEBxjtH3UiNPSVnQ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that you have an idea of the bare bones specs of these two phones, it comes down to the most important question: what can these phones do, how well can they do them, and what makes them stand out?</p><p>Running on the ultra-fast and responsive Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus can keep up with even the most demanding tasks and use cases. You get a significant boost in performance from previous-generation processors, which is necessary to run all the on-board AI features that this phone has to offer. While others rely on the cloud to process certain AI functions, this processor allows the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus to do more locally. That even includes features like Generative photo editing.</p><p>Loaded with the Android 15 OS, Samsung also overlays its One UI 7, which affords access to plenty of cool Galaxy AI features along with customization and personalization options for the look and feel of the phone. Some new features include AI Agent: long-press the power button and you’ll instantly open the Gemini assistant, which works with native app integration. This means no matter what app you’re in, Gemini will assist with what you want, related to that specific app. Sutrich played around with this feature during his review and said it works well. He used it, for example, to find specific recipes within an hour-long YouTube video and it accomplished this with ease.</p><p>A neat new feature with Samsung One UI 7 is Now Brief, which shows AI-powered insights for your sleep, the weather, your daily schedule, and more. You’ll get Auto Suggestions, like a reminder to turn on the smart washing machine based on your usual weekly routine. Multimodal Search, meanwhile, lets you run searches in unique ways, like humming a song to be reminded of its name.</p><p>The most important factor with this phone is its heavy AI integration. You can be more productive and enjoy better context awareness as you switch among apps and use Gemini and other AI tools at your disposal. This includes everything from getting help composing an e-mail in the right tone, to searching for ideas for your next vacation, using Circle to Search to identify what jacket the person in that YouTube video is wearing, and more. Circle to Search now also recognizes phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and URLs so you can instantly open what’s needed. Overall, the phone better understands natural language, so it’s easy to communicate as well.</p><p>Along with the processor, Android 15, and Samsung One UI 7, all this runs smoothly thanks to the 12GB RAM. So, you can enjoy everything from streaming and capturing video to mobile gaming and more. Speaking of gamers, there are features specifically for them, including an improved cooling system, ray tracing, and a Vulkan Engine.</p>

<p>How does the OnePlus 13 stack up? Very strongly. It runs on the same Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile processor. The phone handles switching among apps at a blazing pace, with little to no lag. Sutrich says it exhibits the best haptics he has experienced on a non-Pixel phone. “I have never seen the phone falter once in its impeccable performance, whether that’s normal day-to-day scrolling or playing games at 120 fps.” He also calls multitasking “the best I’ve seen among any flagship phone.”</p><p>The OnePlus 13 has plenty of AI features as well, including intelligent search, AI Notes, and deep Google Gemini integration, just like the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus. However, much of the work is done via cloud computing, so you need an Internet connection, which is one downside.</p><p>It comes loaded with Android 15 and adds OnePlus OxygenOS 15 for its version of personalization, customization, and unique features. You get many of the same features you find in the Galaxy S25 Plus like Circle to Search and intelligent assistance for everything from composing messages to booking vacations, with the intelligence fueled by both Gemini and, with this phone, OxygenOS.</p><p>There’s a cool feature in this phone called BeaconLink that lets you essentially use the device as a walkie-talkie to communicate with another person with the same (or compatible) phone that is up to 200 meters away. This is great if you’re in an area that doesn’t have good mobile coverage, like on a boat or campsite.</p><p>Features in this phone will appeal to gamers as well, including the 12GB or 16GB RAM, depending on which variant you choose, Adreno 830 GPU, and overall fast and snappy processor along with efficient cooling.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VJBAxue4C5n69f7YCmeENP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-back-navy-01" alt="The back of the Navy Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VJBAxue4C5n69f7YCmeENP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The latest premium phones don’t just have fabulous cameras. They also have tons of pre- and post-editing tools you can leverage to get the best images and footage possible. Many of these tools use AI, and that’s true for both of these phones.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus has a 50MP wide AF OIS main camera, 12MP ultra-wide camera, 10MP 3x tele AF OIS camera, and 12MP wide AF front “selfie” camera. The 30x space zoom is impressive so you can capture less grainy, more detailed images from even far distances. Other features include HDR portraits, a nightography mode, and more. For video, you can record 4K video at 60 frames per second using the ProVisual Engine.</p><p>You’ll find all the same AI photo editing features that were in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Samsung Galaxy S24</a>, along with a few new ones. A standout is an improved version of Audio Eraser for videos, which can remove background noise, including conversations, in videos to isolate just the sounds you want. Sutrich tried this as part of his review and was pleased with the results.</p><p>There’s also a new feature called Auto Trim that will intelligently remove things like “ums” and “ahs” in your speech along with blank spaces. Use keywords and the AI will pick out which clips or sound bites aren’t essential and remove them for a cleaner editing experience. For videos taken at night, you’ll be able to better capture moving subjects without worry that the footage will be under or over-exposed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uG8pRQQVBXWj6ZFu58wBMf" name="oneplus-13-blue-case-ocean" alt="Holding the OnePlus 13 in its blue case with the ocean in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uG8pRQQVBXWj6ZFu58wBMf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching over to the OnePlus 13, OnePlus relies on Sony cameras for the OnePlus 13, which affords a massive step up in performance. Sutrich says it’s “easily one of the best smartphone cameras I’ve ever used.”</p><p>The set-up includes a 50MP main camera, 50MP telephoto camera with an incredible up to 120x zoom, 50MP ultra-wide camera, and a 32MP front camera. You can take 4K video at 60 frames-per-second and enjoy features like portrait mode, night scene, panorama, time-lapse, and more. Dual Exposure is worth noting, which can capture moving subjects with incredible clarity, along with Action Mode that accomplishes fantastic detail in action shots. Clear Burst lets you hold down the shutter to take multiple photos to capture that perfect moment.</p><p>What really sets this phone apart when it comes to the cameras are all the useful and effective AI photo editing tools. There’s AI Detail Boost, AI Unblur, and even a feature that removes distracting objects from a photo. In most cases, you’ll find similar equivalents with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, as well as other phones like Google Pixel devices. But one that works wonderfully and I haven’t seen in other phones is the AI Reflection Eraser. This will intelligently remove distracting reflections from a photo so you get a clearer image of something with glass or another reflective surface.</p><p>Bottom line: Sutrich says there “wasn’t a single category where I saw the OnePlus 13’s camera falter.”</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pm3DpFcaQkKZYM6wkynkSm" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-03" alt="The back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pm3DpFcaQkKZYM6wkynkSm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes down to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus vs. OnePlus 13, the OnePlus 13 is all-around the better phone. In fact, Sutrich says in his review that it’s “the best-built Android phone on the market, full stop.” You won’t find a better phone. Considering it’s the same price as the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, the decision is simple.</p><p>Now, there are still reasons to stick with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus. If you are familiar with the Samsung ecosystem and feel more comfortable with it, you might want to stay with that. This is especially so if you have Samsung smart devices in the home, and/or a Samsung Galaxy Watch and/or Galaxy Ring. If so, it makes sense to have a Galaxy phone as well and be able to enjoy everything the ecosystem has to offer.</p><p>You also get longer support with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, including a whole three more Android updates and an extra year of security updates. Considering you will probably upgrade to a new phone in another three or four years anyway, this isn’t a big deal. But you will be able to resell or hand this phone down to a friend or family member and be confident they’ll get the most out of it.</p><p>It's important to note that brands like OnePlus have really upped their game with their latest devices. The OnePlus 12 ranked among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> we have reviewed to date, and the OnePlus 13 will undoubtedly be replacing that model for the top spot.</p><p>There’s nothing specific to learn about how it works, since it’s incredibly intuitive. It’s the most durable consumer-level phone you’ll find on the market yet it’s still sleek and downright beautiful. While we wish it had more storage and Qi2 support built in, these are minor complaints, and really the only ones we can find with this phone.</p><p>The cameras and camera editing features, software, processing speeds, and performance are all top-notch with the OnePlus 13. If you’re looking for a new premium Android phone you can hang onto for many years to come, and that will give you access to multitasking, AI features, capture great photos, and even go into the hot tub with you on your next vacation, the OnePlus 13 is the one to choose.</p><p>You’ll still get a great device with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, including wonderful cameras, powerful processing and onboard AI features (that’s a huge plus worth noting), decent battery life, a sleek look, and extra-long software support. But overall, for most users who aren’t tied to a specific platform, the OnePlus 13 is a winning choice.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 series is admittedly not the most exciting hardware upgrade we were hoping for, but some of the new Galaxy AI features make you want to give it a second look. One in particular that caught our attention the most during our hands-on with the S25 series is the new Audio Eraser feature. Samsung says this will let you remove unwanted sounds from any video stored on your S25 device, and you can even fine-tune which sounds you wish to subdue or remove altogether.</p><p>If you've pre-ordered a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a> device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, here's how to use the Audio Eraser feature in your Gallery app.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-series-2">How to use Audio Eraser on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Gallery</strong> app on your S25 device and find the video you wish to edit.</p><p>2. When previewing the video, tap the <strong>Sparkle icon</strong> from the bottom to take you directly to the Audio Eraser page.</p><p>3. Alternately, you can tap <strong>Edit</strong> (pencil icon) below the video, and the <strong>Audio</strong> icon on the far right on the next screen. Then, tap <strong>Audio Eraser</strong> for the AI to analyze the video.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4375px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.03%;"><img id="oymJNY3vAr4RWt63qyeEHe" name="audio-eraser-galaxy-s25-series-1" alt="Audio Eraser on S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oymJNY3vAr4RWt63qyeEHe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4375" height="3064" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>3. After a few seconds, you'll be presented with a few options. Tap <strong>Auto </strong>to autmatically remove any background noise in the video.</p><p>4. Depending on the types of sounds in the video and how legible they are, Galaxy AI will give you up to six options to manipulate.</p><p>5. You can then choose individual sounds like <strong>Voices</strong>, <strong>Noise</strong>, <strong>Music</strong>, etc., and adjust the intensity for each.</p><p>6. The <strong>Hear original</strong> button in the upper-left corner of the screen lets you quickly compare your edits to the original audio.</p><p>7. Once you're satisfied with your edits, tap <strong>Done</strong> and <strong>Save copy</strong>. This preserves your original video in case you need it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ex5Bc8nxVQwGpYDMakpErk" name="audio-eraser-galaxy-s25-series-2" alt="Audio Eraser editing menu on S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ex5Bc8nxVQwGpYDMakpErk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Audio Eraser can detect up to six types of sounds such as Voices, Music, Wind, Nature, Crowd, and Noise. Samsung cautions users that it's possible for the AI to not recognize all sounds, every single time, as it largely depends on the source audio quality and recording condition of the video.</p>
<h2 id="audio-eraser-is-not-the-sole-reason-to-get-the-galaxy-s25-but-it-s-compelling-2">Audio Eraser is not the sole reason to get the Galaxy S25, but it's compelling</h2>
<p>If you've used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Google Pixel 8</a>, then you would have noticed that this Audio Eraser feature in the Galaxy S25 series is a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a> on the older Pixels. The big difference though is that Samsung's implementation works completely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a> and doesn't send anything to the cloud for processing, according to Samsung. You can manipulate a many more types of sounds (six in total) compared to what Google offers. Audio Eraser can work on any video that you have stored on your device, so it doesn't have to be recorded by the S25 device itself.</p><p>The big question probably on you mind right now is, will Audio Eraser come to the Galaxy S24 series or older flagships? This is something Samsung hasn't confirmed nor denied yet. You can try out the latest beta of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">One UI 7 on the S24 series</a> if you come under the supported regions, but make sure you backup all your data first. I don't think Samsung will release Audio Eraser for older Galaxy flagships as it's one of their new marquee feature that it will want exclusively for the new phones.</p><p>This could be due to hardware processing restrictions or simply because it might want to force users to upgrade. Either way, if you must have this cool new feature, you'll have to spring for the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phone</a>.</p>

However, the higher-priced Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra models both support UWB.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-uwb-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-2">Everything you need to know about UWB on the Samsung Galaxy S25</h2>
<p>Samsung's latest trio of flagship phones pack a few hardware and connectivity upgrades, including Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 support. However, the base model, 6.2-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25</a> still does not include an ultra-wideband (UWB) chip. Meanwhile, both the mid-tier, 6.7-inch Galaxy S25 Plus and high-end, 6.9-inch Galaxy S25 Ultra models feature a UWB chip.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-uwb-galaxy-s21-series-and-which-models-support-it">UWB</a> is a relatively new technology that became mainstream with recent Apple and Samsung phones, and is also found on other handsets. Essentially, it's a near-field radio communication protocol optimized for both data transfer and location. With better range and precision than Bluetooth, UWB is ideal for finding other UWB-enabled trackers and devices.</p><p>For instance, Samsung's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-2-announcement">Samsung SmartTag 2</a> — an item tracker that you can attach to keys, wallets, or anything else — has a UWB chip for precision finding. While older, standard versions of the SmartTag relied on Bluetooth, the newer model uses UWB. However, for this use case and many others, you'll need a Galaxy S25 Plus or Ultra phone rather than a base Galaxy S25.</p>

<p>Additionally, some other apps use UWB to connect with products and accessories if your phone supports the connection protocol. Some car manufacturers will let your phone work as a car key if it supports UWB, like BMW, Audi, and Ford. Tile is another example of a third-party accessory maker that uses UWB to connect with trackers.</p><p>For those who need UWB support, choosing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus </a>or Ultra is a must. Unfortunately, Samsung's cheapest Galaxy S25 model still does not include a UWB chip.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini 2.0 Flash is rolling out now for free users in the Gemini app.</li><li>It replaces Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental, which was once exclusively for subscribers, and will eventually replace Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini 1.5 Pro.</li><li>Google One AI Premium subscribers still get a larger context window and exclusive features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is now making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.0 Flash</a> available for free users in the Gemini app, replacing the placeholder Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model, and eventually older Gemini models. Gemini 1.5 Flash and 1.5 Pro will stick around for "the next few weeks" so users can continue their conversations. After that, Gemini 2.0 models — starting with Gemini 2.0 Flash will replace them.</p><p>Previously, the Gemini 2.0 Flash experimental model was exclusive to Gemini Advanced subscribers in the Gemini app. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> members still get exclusive perks, like a one-million token context window (good for up to 1,500 pages of file uploads), Deep Research, Gems, and more. Free users get access to Gemini 2.0 Flash conversations and image uploads.</p><p>Google describes the Gemini 2.0 Flash model as offering "fast responses and stronger performance across a number of key benchmarks, providing everyday help with tasks like brainstorming, learning or writing." Comparatively, the Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental model it replaces was described as "an early preview and might not work as expected."</p><p>Presumably, the future Gemini lineup will include Gemini 2.0 Flash, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-feature-expands-to-more-languages-and-regions">Gemini 1.5 Pro with Deep Research</a>, and Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced — with the latter two models being paid offerings for Gemini Advanced users. All users now get improved Imagen 3 image generation, which "delivers richer details and textures" and "follows your instructions with greater accuracy," according to Google.</p><p>Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-subscribers-can-now-use-gemini-flash-2-0-experimental-in-latest-gemini-app-beta">became available for Gemini app beta testers last month</a>. It's unclear when we might see Gemini 2.0 Experimental Advanced, or other 2.0 models, become stable. The stable Gemini 2.0 Flash model is already available on the Gemini web client and is rolling out now in the Gemini app, with free access available for the first time.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is tinkering with a new shade for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-dark-mode-google-search-desktop">dark theme in Search</a>, giving it a subtle color twist. It’s not exactly in-your-face, but more like a quiet refresh that might fly under the radar for most.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/28/google-blue-dark-theme/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the new look swaps the usual dark gray for a richer, more vibrant blue. It’s a small but noticeable tweak, showing Google is always fine-tuning things to make Search easier on the eyes, especially in low-light settings.</p><p>It’s unclear exactly when this new look rolled out, as per 9to5, but it might’ve been quietly live for a while—maybe even a few weeks.</p><p>Right now, Google Search and the Android app use a dark gray theme, and while it gets the job done, some folks find it a bit dull. To spice things up, Google's experiment is a richer, bolder blue theme that’s noticeably deeper and more vibrant than the current one.</p><p>The switch to this new color scheme amps up the contrast between text and background, making things easier to read.</p><p>Spotting this change might be tricky. The current dark theme is mostly dark gray, while the new version shifts ever so slightly toward a faint blue tint. Luckily, 9to5Google shared some side-by-side visuals that highlight the tiny but noticeable difference between the two.</p>

<p>If you’re not spotting the new theme yet, here’s a hack: log out of your account and hop into Incognito mode.</p><p>The new dark blue theme is also popping up in the Google app for Android, but only for those rocking the latest beta version. It gives the Home and Search tabs a fresh background color, which tweaks how your search results look in the app.</p><p>In the Google app, the blue dark theme isn’t just about the background—it’s also giving the search bar and bottom navigation bar a lighter blue makeover, creating a cool contrast with the darker backdrop. But not everything has caught up yet; spots like the ‘Saved’ and ‘Notifications’ sections are still rocking the old gray look.</p>

<hr>
<p>Fitbit is giving kids a gaming gift for the new year that keeps them active in two new interactive ways.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/The-Pulse-Fitbit-Community-Blog/Fitbit-Ace-LTE-new-games/ba-p/5717831">community post</a>, Fitbit announced that users with an Ace LTE will soon download two new games: Shutterbug and Gnome Heisters. A press release to Android Central revealed that these two games are designed to ensure kids remain "active and engaged" while enjoying the relaxation of these two colorful smartwatch games.</p><p>Available via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbitacelte/answer/14953102">Fitbit Arcade</a> collection, Shutterbug is all about turning kids into photographers for their expressive new clients: bugs. The company states kids can "test their point-and-shoot photography skills as they’re tasked to take the perfect shot of bugs hiding in different locations."</p><p>All bugs in the area must be found and photographed before you can move on to the next level.</p><p>The next game, Gnome Heisters, is all about being meticulous and calculative. Fitbit states that, in this game, users need to help gnomes "complete escapades" so they can brag about pulling the greatest heist ever.</p><p>To ensure your child's Ace LTE is prepared for these new games, ensure the latest software (Season 3) is downloaded/installed. After, the waiting game begins as Fitbit states the update has started making its rounds this week. So, checking your Ace LTE periodically is recommended.</p>

<p>The Fitbit Ace LTE had a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-debit-card-school-returns-update">major content drop</a> a few months ago that brought two games: Spirit Garden and Sproutlings. The former is a relaxing mindful game with guided practices while the latter is about raising and nurturing pets. During that update, Fitbit stated that it worked to improve the gaming experience for kids by adding "haptic feedback and ear-catching sounds."</p><p>The company also extended support for "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-school-time-parental-android-feature-detailed">School Time</a>" to parents with kids who own an Ace LTE. Similar to its functions on Android, School Time on the Ace LTE lets parents set a period where the more fun capabilities of the device are unavailable. As the name implies, parents can set this time to revolve around school hours to make sure their child is attentive and engaged in schoolwork.</p><p>Additional updates for handling digital payment methods and "Daily Quests" are available on the Ace LTE, as well.</p>

<p>DeepSeek is a Chinese AI laboratory that has recently released the DeepSeek R1 AI model. It's an AI ChatBot based on Meta's free and open-source <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q3-2024-earnings">Llama 3.3,</a> trained by the DeepSeek team.</p><p>You're going to read a bunch of terms like LLM (Large Language Model) and reasoning, but what it all means is that researchers and engineers worked on writing software that can be "trained," either through manual input or by actually searching the internet, to find the answer to a question and present it in a way that sounds like a real person wrote it. The software can separate different problems from a single question and tackle them individually.

<p>DeepSeek is good, but it's not perfect. It will return incorrect results and it's censored by the Chinese government. If you do try it, don't bother asking about the Uyghur people or Tiananmen Square.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-everyone-talking-about-deepseek-ai-2">Why is everyone talking about DeepSeek AI?</h2>
<p>There are two reasons: it's new, and it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deepseek-already-had-a-usd1-trillion-impact-and-its-just-getting-started">costs a lot less</a> to develop than similar AI models. A <em><strong>lot</strong></em> less.</p><p>As an end-user who is not an investor or Nvidia shareholder, I don't care about the costs. While it was far less than the amount OpenAI spent, it's still an astronomical amount that you or I can only dream of having access to. Technology is that way — companies choose to spend money to develop something instead of feeding starving kids. It's not going to change.</p><p>I will say one thing about the cost: Is anyone surprised that China was able to produce something of comparable or greater quality than a Western product at a fraction of the cost? Labor costs, taxes, environmental protections, and bureaucracy all add up. China has all of this figured out for the time being.</p><p>Other than the price, the simple fact is that DeepSeek R1 is new and works well. It debuted in December 2024, quickly gained popularity in mobile app stores, and now everyone is talking about it. It's the very same thing that happened when ChatGPT was first made public. We find new novelties interesting as a species.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-privacy-issues-with-deepseek-ai-should-you-try-it-2">What about privacy issues with DeepSeek AI? Should you try it?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1170px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.74%;"><img id="C7vVpqcpM2yDUZYnPejsyM" name="DeepSeek-privacy-policy" alt="DeepSeek's privacy policy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C7vVpqcpM2yDUZYnPejsyM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1170" height="734" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/data-protection-day-is-a-great-day-to-stop-using-deepseek">there are plenty of privacy issues</a>, and the same issues you would find with the same type of products from Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc., apply to DeepSeek. You are entering data into the machine every time you type in the box. How that data gets treated is very importan,t and companies need to be fully transparent about how it is collected, used, and stored.</p><p>DeepSeek is actually pretty good with this. The company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chat.deepseek.com/downloads/DeepSeek%20Privacy%20Policy.html" target="_blank">privacy policy</a> spells out all the terrible practices it uses, such as sharing your user data with Baidu search and shipping everything off to be stored in servers controlled by the Chinese government.</p><p>You can download and install DeepSeek locally to bypass some of this data collection, but not all of it. In any case, the company is likely betting that you either won't care or just won't read the privacy policy. I applaud both their audacity and transparency.</p><p>There is speculation that DeepSeek is also doing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-ai-china-privacy-data/" target="_blank">some very sketchy things</a>, especially through the mobile app. Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, and META also do some very sketchy things through their mobile apps when it comes to privacy, but they don't ship it all off to China. Our official company guidance from IT is not to install it on a work-provided device and to not use our company Google accounts to sign into DeepSeek's website. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/us-navy-restricts-use-of-deepseek-ai-imperative-to-avoid-using.html" target="_blank">U.S. Navy has stated</a> that the service can not be used in any capacity by any service member.</p><p>Better safe than sorry. You need to think about these issues before you try DeepSeek. Don't let the hype and fear of missing out compel you to just tap and opt-in to everything so you can be part of something new. Not because DeepSeek comes from China, but because you should do this for <em><strong>every</strong></em> new awesome thing you read about on the internet.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1460px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="759HG5MKU7Z9hYmwewvnQQ" name="white-house.JPG" alt="The White House" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/759HG5MKU7Z9hYmwewvnQQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1460" height="821" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: whitehouse.gov)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's possible, and it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/white-house-evaluates-china-ai-app-deepseeks-affect-national-security-official-2025-01-28/" target="_blank">already being investigated</a>.</p><p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says that DeepSeek is being investigated to determine the national security implications of the service, and the administration's cryptocurrency czar, David Sacks, claims <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/news/live/deepseek-latest-news" target="_blank">intellectual property theft could be happening</a>. OpenAI is saying the same thing, claiming that DeepSeek secretly used its software.</p><p>President <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/trump-china-deepseek-ai-wake-call-rcna189526" target="_blank">Donald Trump says</a> this should be a "wake-up call" to the American AI industry and that the White House is working to ensure American dominance remains in effect concerning AI.</p><p>DeepSeek sends far more data from Americans to China than TikTok does, and it freely admits to this. The data is also potentially more sensitive as well. It's hard to say if someone in Washington will decide that DeepSeek is abusing our data or causing U.S. companies to lose too much money and ban the service outright. It might happen, and we shouldn't be surprised if it does.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster on X discovered a new Google Maps update that adds proper support for its glanceable navigation info on Samsung's Now Bar.</li><li>Users with a Galaxy S24 have reportedly spotted its functioning in the One UI 7 beta, though others are having difficulties.</li><li>Google detailed several uses for Samsung's Now Bar on the Galaxy S25, like news, sports, maps navigation, and more during Unpacked.</li><li>Samsung confirmed that One UI 7 will arrive on past-gen Galaxy S phones "imminently" following its latest flagship trio.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There's a lot that users awaiting One UI 7 can expect and a recent discovery shows that Google is making sure one of its apps is ready.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1884851908793311454">Tarun Vats on X</a>, a Google Maps update is here for those in the waiting room for Samsung's wider One UI 7 rollout (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/google-maps-now-bar-samsung-one-ui-7-update/">9to5Google</a>). The tipster noticed an update arriving for past-gen Galaxy phone owners marked as version 25.04.01.71725 for Google Maps. Vats states that this update adds support for the Maps chip in One UI 7's Now Bar and "Live Activities."</p><p>The post shows that users with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> (and likely in the One UI 7 beta) should notice Maps appear in the Now Bar. If it does, users will see brief information, such as its icon, how far you are to your next turn/destination, and an arrow for additional understanding. Users can also quickly exit Google Maps' navigation via the lock screen by tapping the button in the widget.</p><p>The Live Activities portion is the small indicator in the top left of your device's display on the home screen. It simply shows the distance and the direction you should be heading. Further, users can have a much larger navigation card on their home screen with the same information as the lock screen.</p><p>Users chimed into Vats' thread on X, stating the update has appeared on a Galaxy S23, meaning it will likely see Maps on the Now Bar once the update drops. Elsewhere, one user with a Galaxy S24 claims the update has been installed, but Maps is not functioning on the lock screen.</p>

<p>Google Maps integration with the Now Bar is nothing new as an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-lock-screen-keeps-you-in-the-loop-on-sports-and-directions">Unpacked press release</a> stated as much last week. The latest Maps update provides extended support to past-gen Galaxy devices in the One UI 7 beta awaiting its full release. Users who've purchased a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25</a> will see Maps, sports, entertainment, fitness tracking, and more via the Now Bar straight out of the box. Google also states that the Now Bar will support news articles, so you can quickly glance at what's happening.</p><p>Samsung's One UI 7 beta has progressed as users enrolled in the program got their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">hands on Beta 3</a> early this month. It was a significant update with a 1.2GB download size and a long list of bug fixes. Samsung was busy improving its Game Booster mode with playback setting changes, FPS setting alterations, and more. Some other QoL (quality of life) additions were implemented to aid the Quick Panel's closing operations.</p><p>The Korean OEM <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">recently confirmed</a> that its One UI 7 (Android 15) update will drop onto past-gen Galaxy S devices "imminently." A blog post states the software is eyeing a Q1 2025 launch date for older smartphones after several of its elements/changes were "praised" by testers. Specifically, the company's AI features are reportedly sitting pretty well with users.</p><p>A Q1 launch gives us a time frame between now and March, so there's not much wait time left as Samsung polishes things up.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Qi2 became readily available for Android phones last year, but smartphones are often designed more than a year in advance of their release — that's partly why we've only seen a few Qi2-equipped phones debut, like the HMD Skyline. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-s25-could-bring-qi2-revolution">2025 was supposed to be the year where Qi2 took off</a>, and it will be. But it's only because the Wireless Power Consortium bent the rules.</p><p>Qi is a ubiquitous wireless charging standard maintained by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), but it's aging. The standard only requires a minimum 5W charging speed, and doesn't utilize magnets or other fancy features. That's why the WPC designed Qi2 in coordination with big tech companies, like Apple, which effectively gave <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-favorite-magsafe-phone-grips-ranked">MagSafe</a> to the standard.</p><p>Qi2 has the Magnetic Power Profile, a magnetic connection method designed for precise alignment with chargers and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-magnetic-wallet-galaxy-s25-retail-listing">universal compatibility with MagSafe/Qi2 accessories</a> — or at least, it did.</p><p>We first spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-does-not-require-magnets">references to a version of Qi2 that did not require magnets</a> back in August 2024. After reporting on it, a spokesperson for the WPC swiftly corrected us, explaining that while the Qi v2.0 specification does allow for Extended Power Profile (EPP) devices without magnets to comply, these devices and accessories "cannot call itself Qi2 or use the Qi2 logo."</p><p>"Any packaging or marketing materials for such a device would have required language informing the consumer that this device does not include magnets," the WPC continued.</p><p>The WPC made similar statements in a more recent round of reporting around Qi2's magnet situation in December 2024, when the official X (formerly Twitter) account confirmed that all Qi2 devices must have magnets.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi Chris! A phone carrying the Qi2 logo is using the Qi v2.0 specification and Magnetic Power Profile or MPP.   So, yes, if it says Qi2 it must have magnets.

However, are two different power profiles that carry a Qi logo.  (1) Basic Power Profile (BPP) devices that charge at 5W,…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1870115419799072923">December 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Here's where things get confusing: the WPC has now completely tossed aside this premise. In January 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">the WPC announced a new branding</a>, called "Qi2 Ready." Essentially, it allows phones to use Qi2 tech without adding magnets — which renders every statement the WPC has made prior to this announcement irrelevant.</p><p>Phones branded as Qi2 Ready support Qi2 tech on the inside, such as 15W wireless charging, and leverage accessories to add magnetic connection. The WPC says these Qi2 Ready devices and accessories will deliver the full Qi2 user experience "in approved combinations."</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a> appears to be the first smartphones to utilize this Qi2 Ready standard, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">because it doesn't have magnets</a>. But that isn't actually clear. I've yet to see a single spec sheet, product page, or WPC listing for the Galaxy S25 that references Qi2 Ready. In fact, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jpsapi.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/products/qi/23212" target="_blank">official Galaxy S25 Ultra entry in the WPC database</a> lists the device as Qi2.1 certified — it doesn't mention Qi2 Ready or the lack of magnets at all.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1252px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.68%;"><img id="KfLQvtUCR7wwT2woMxfBp5" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-Qi2-Database" alt="The official Galaxy S25 entry in the WPC database." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfLQvtUCR7wwT2woMxfBp5.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1252" height="1248" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Wireless Power Consortium)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Central reached out to Samsung about the uncertainty surrounding the Galaxy S25's Qi2 support, and the company returned the following statement via email: "The Galaxy S25 does support Qi2 wireless charging up to 15W — a case can be leveraged to take advantage of this capability."</p><p>Again, based on the WPC's original definition of Qi2, that shouldn't be possible. The newer "Qi2 Ready" workaround isn't mentioned at all, further complicating things. If that wasn't confusing enough, the WPC listed a Qi2.1 certification for a Samsung magnetic case that would round out Qi2 support on the Galaxy S25 — presumably one of the "approved combinations" it described — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/28/qi2-smartphone-cases-certified-database/" target="_blank">before subsequently removing it</a>.</p>

<p>Android Central also reached out to the WPC for clarification on the Qi2 specification, and asked about the confusion that the new standards could cause for consumers. We didn't hear back in time for publication, but will update this article when we do.</p><p>The saga surrounding Qi2 on Android is tough to follow, and that's the problem. Apple giving MagSafe to the Qi2 standard was supposed to create a unified ecosystem of chargers and accessories between iOS and Android phones. It was a rare gift from a company that likes to create so-called "walled gardens" and exclusive features for its users. Android OEMs and the WPC have squandered it.</p><p>We're now in a position where all iPhones are Qi2 certified with magnets, some Android phones are Qi2 certified with magnets, some Android phones are Qi2 certified without magnets, and most Android phones aren't Qi2 certified at all. Without sounding too dramatic, it's a borderline disaster.</p><p>Qi2 and the WPC are following the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-usb-c">bad precedent set by USB and the USB Implementers Forum</a> — there have been enough renamings and discrepancies that there are multiple Qi2 versions, and no one knows what any of them really mean.</p><p>Considering the lofty goals of the WPC, this outcome is extremely disappointing to see. "The Qi v2.0 standard will unify the wireless charging industry under one global standard, eliminating consumer confusion and enabling greater device interoperability," the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wirelesspowerconsortium.com/standards/qi-wireless-charging/#:~:text=The%20Qi%20v2.0%20standard%20will%20unify%20the%20wireless%20charging%20industry%20under%20one%20global%20standard%2C%20eliminating%20consumer%20confusion%20and%20enabling%20greater%20device%20interoperability." target="_blank">WPC's website still states</a>.</p><p>Over a year after Qi2 was made available, wireless charging is more disjointed than ever.</p>

<ul><li>Google dropped a new easter egg on Search and, this time, is a retro throwback game called "Block Breaker."</li><li>Similar to the original game, Breakout, users have a single paddle, one ball, and four rows of Google-colored bricks in the company's version.</li><li>Google Search often drops its easter eggs out of nowhere, like its other throwbacks via Snake, Minesweeper, and Tic-Tac-Toe.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Every so often Google gets a little silly and adds in a secret easter egg for users looking for a little downtime.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-searchs-new-easter-egg-breaking-blocks/">Android Police</a>, Google Search has a new easter egg that takes you back to the days of retro gaming. Users can look up "Block Breaker" in Search and find its colorful logo and convenient play button. It's a game that reminds us of old phones with pullout antennae, rubber number pads, and a tiny screen. Google's version of this classic game keeps in theme with what you'd expect: a singular pad, one ball, and four rows of Google-colored bricks.</p><p>However, Google throws in different colored bricks and power-ups to make the game interesting.</p><p>Users hitting the right bricks can gain a bubble power-up that slows the balls down as they plummet back toward you. Another buff gives you two blasters on either end of the paddle that shoots up at the bricks. Then, there's the safety net — just in case you didn't see that third ball to your right.</p><p>Bricks with power-ups are clearly marked, so you know your next target. Additionally, on desktop, the game is displayed in a small, overlayed window (which you can also make larger). The left and right arrow keys slide you across the playing field while the up arrow sends the ball to kick things off.</p><p>The publication also drops a bit of history, stating Google's game, like all others, are reinvented versions of the original brick-breaking game, Breakout, by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak from Atari (known more as the creators of Apple).</p>

<p>Entering "Block Breaker" into Search will display the newest easter egg, as well as a library of Google's other games. Users can enjoy a session of Snake, PAC-MAN, Minesweeper, Tic-Tac-Toe, and more.</p><p>Google's no stranger to dropping unique and wacky easter eggs in Search regarding games or the time of the year — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-search-twosday-easter-egg">like Twosday</a>. In 2022, on February 22, people called it "Twosday" because the written date was all 2s. If you were on Search at the time and typed Twosday into its bar, you'd see results for the once-in-a-lifetime date alongside a bombardment of the number. This special occurrence isn't expected to happen again for another 400 years; well, 397 years, this February.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-mandalorian-grogu-google-easter-egg">magical, space-themed</a> easter egg dropped during Disney Plus' "The Mandalorian" hype in 2023. The cute baby Grogu was on Search that day for anyone who looked up information about the show. Grogu would enter on the bottom right of your screen and use the Force to yank your results off the page and pile them up.</p><p>The Force is truly strong with that one.</p>
