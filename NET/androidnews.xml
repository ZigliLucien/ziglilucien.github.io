This is exactly what AI does well and demonstrates the basics of how the tech actually works.</p><h2 id="how-google-s-ai-helps-the-mlb-2">How Google's AI helps the MLB</h2><p>There are a lot of parts to this tricky system, but baseball fans love statistics and predictions. The visualizations built by the system are really cool, too.</p><p>Using radar, high-speed drones, AI, and a lifetime of historical data gave us a neat look at the kinds of things baseball nerds love: batter's preferred "sweet spots", how weather can affect a ball's flight, where a ball would land at various stadiums and where a homer would land at Atlanta's Truist Park when the sluggers make that connection.</p><p>It's all done using pure data. Some is gathered in real-time using the drones and radar, but a lot of it is also historical. Everything in baseball is tracked; some fans can spout more facts than you would ever want to know. What's needed is a fast, accurate, and efficient way to parse it all. That's where AI comes in.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX" name="Gemini-Pro-tokens.jpg" alt="Google Gemini Pro's new token count" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Imagine a giant spreadsheet that tells us what happened with every pitch of every game in the past 50 years. Was it a ball or a strike? How fast was the pitch? Did it break over the plate, and if so, where?</p><p>Then imagine an equally large spreadsheet from the batter's perspective. Did the ball cross the plate in the strike zone, and if so, where? How fast was it? How did the pitch break? Most importantly, did the batter connect with the pitch, and if so, where and how did the ball fly?</p><p>That's an insane amount of information. A perfectly pitched game still has 81 individual pitches, and you'll never see one. With hundreds of pitches and hundreds of games every year, the sheer amount of data is impossible for a person to analyze in real time.</p><p>That's what AI does best, though. Provide the right data for AI to look at, and it can tell you anything. If you tell AI about every seemingly insignificant stat from every single pitch in every MLB game, it can predict what will happen when presented with the real-time data of the current pitch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX" name="ask-gemini-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-3" alt="Ask Gemini prompt on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Say Joe steps up to the plate for his second at-bat. He's warmed up from playing a few innings, Bob the pitcher has loosened up nicely but hasn't blown out his arm yet, and Bob throws a beautiful breaking pitch to start the inning.</p><p>It crosses the plate just above Baseball Joe's knees at 87 mph, and Joe is ready for it. He swings in a low arc and smashes it! All the data from what happens when Bob throws that pitch at that speed across the plate at that spot is there for AI to analyze.</p><p>AI also has data telling it what happens when Joe hits a pitch at that spot and at that speed. Using this historical data, a projected path can be built. Compare that with real-time data collected by the drones and sensors to compensate for things like humidity, and AI has a very good idea of where that ball will land. It will tell us as it's happening, and we love it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="sWYNyURt2PjsWsE7DxmVHB" name="Google-ai-server.jpg" alt="Google Tensor server backdrop on stage at Google I/O 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWYNyURt2PjsWsE7DxmVHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4030" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can expand those basics into everything, and it works mostly the same way. For example, you have historical data saved on your phone or in an online account profile. You have real-time data being gathered by your phone or your watch. AI uses the two to "create" an answer for almost any relevant question.</p><p>It can tell you if the sunset will be nice tonight at the beach. It can pair the latest photo you took with a past photo of the same subject for a nice collage. It can predict traffic patterns. It can even estimate when a piece of machinery will need servicing on an assembly line. The functional and useful information it provides uses the same types of patterns as predicting a home run at the All-Star game.</p><p>This is also why AI needs to be fast to be more useful. Telling us where a baseball landed isn't as useful as telling us where it will land, for example. Specialized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomms-new-on-device-ai-chip-could-change-smart-glasses-forever">AI accelerators</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/a-coprocessor-really-is-a-wonderful-thing">coprocessors</a> are used to do what is needed <em>when</em> it's needed.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">AI can do a lot of other things</a> besides the basics of searching through piles of information or making a prediction based on that information, but a lot of that is hit or miss. Predicting that Kyle Schwarber's last swing would fly into the seats to break the tie is a lot easier for a computer algorithm to figure out, and what AI was originally designed to do.</p><p>It's really good at it!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="1902e49f-11ee-4e70-8edb-acecb4d8c9b9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnQGJNQVqF2XVQV4KfMbN8.jpg' alt="google pixel 9 square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>The best AI phone</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>AI powerhouse</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 9 has a premium build, excellent cameras, and better connectivity than its predecessors.

The original poster (OP), VHBlazer, states they received a $96 off discount for the NFL Sunday Ticket as a returning subscriber. The user states they typically subscribe and then kick it after March Madness.</p><p>This was reported earlier this week, and it seems it's still rolling out. Of course, there's likely some underlying conditions there.</p><p>While others have started receiving their emails, they report an interesting occurrence: the price discount is <em>not </em>always the same. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1m0p9vo/comment/n3bwia2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">few users who've been emailed</a> by YouTube TV in hopes of returning claim they've been offered $48 off, instead of $96. It's not exactly clear why there's this gap in discounts.</p><p>On the other hand, some users say they haven't received a "returning user" email, but attempting to return manually shows a discounted price. Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1m0p9vo/comment/n3ccf53/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">even report getting the email</a>, yet trying to purchase still shows the full price undiscounted price. Perhaps contacting YouTube TV's support would be beneficial here.</p><h2 id="the-nfl-25-26-season-is-upon-us-2">The NFL '25-'26 Season is upon us</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1m0p9vo/nfl_sunday_ticket_returning_subscriber_deal_96_off">NFL Sunday Ticket returning subscriber deal: $96 off</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv">r/youtubetv</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Back in June, YouTube TV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/huge-youtube-tv-deals-nfl-sunday-ticket-games-2025-season-report">announced some major discounts</a> for new NFL Sunday Ticket holders interested in watching their first season. New consumers purchasing the Season Pass on YouTube can do so for $276, while those on YouTube's Primetime Channels will see it for $318.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that the previous announcement didn't concern recurring or returning NFL Sunday Ticket holders at all. Those users would still see the same full-priced packages. Now, though, with the recent Reddit reports, perhaps YouTube TV is offering a little love to its older, unsubscribed crowd.</p><p>Also, YouTube TV's monthly payment option for the NFL season is rolling out in more States for more users. This should give users a little more flexibility with the NFL Sunday Ticket moving forward. Be warned: YouTube TV states Season Pass' monthly installment plan length will change from 12 months to eight as we near the beginning of the season in September.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Regarding the former, Google says this update aims to bring its AI into a position where it can help users "get things done faster." There's nothing faster than letting the AI call businesses and set up appointments for you, which is where this update takes us.</p><p>Google highlights its agentic capabilities headed for Search, which will enable its AI to call businesses for pricing information and availability for a visit. If you're looking up a pet groomer, Google says users should soon find a "Have AI check pricing" button right beneath the map. The AI will then run you through a "request." It's a short questionnaire, so the AI knows everything about you and your pet before calling.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="vQuJoB46hgMcCxuDrrp7yb" name="google-search-have-ai-check-pricing" alt="Google Search is receiving a "Have AI check for pricing" button, which lets it call businesses on your behalf for info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vQuJoB46hgMcCxuDrrp7yb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1068" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="GzHR6QLqsnDG2MhASyPxzb" name="google-search-ai-calling-update-request-email" alt="Google Search's AI, after calling businesses, will compile its information into an update email for the user, per their request." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzHR6QLqsnDG2MhASyPxzb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1070" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It will question you about your pet's breed, weight, what service you're looking for, when you'd like to visit, and your contact information.

This Pro model advances what AI Mode can already do with better reasoning capabilities for math and code-related questions. What's more, AI Mode's Gemini 2.5 Pro integration brings Google's "Deep Search" ability.</p><p>Google says this option, when asking a question, can help "save hours by issuing hundreds of searches, reasoning across disparate pieces of information and crafting a comprehensive, fully-cited report in minutes." In short, Deep Search dives in deep, digging up every bit of information for you on a particular subject and compiling it neatly.</p><p>This is for users who want every piece of information <em>before </em>making an important decision. Since the advanced reasoning and Deep Search are brought to you by Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google says the toggle for it in AI Mode is only available for subscribers. Those with AI Pro or AI Ultra can click "AI Mode" and swap to the 2.5 Pro option for these advanced features if you've enrolled in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/22">Search Labs</a> experiment.</p><h2 id="ai-mode-levels-up-again-2">AI Mode levels up (again)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WPwBbvkCNKuxLfmwvPoxZf" name="Shopping-AI-Mode-checkout" alt="Shopping on AI Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WPwBbvkCNKuxLfmwvPoxZf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In May, during I/O 2025, AI Mode <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">completely stole Google Search's thunder</a> when the company announced Gemini integration. The feature was being granted Gemini 2.5, the predecessor to what the feature is starting to receive today. The model was added to AI Overviews, as well, bringing the intelligence it needed to handle complex queries. This was a custom version of the model that arrived, making it more "ideal" for whatever topic the user was curious about.</p><p>Even shopping with AI Mode was boosted. Users could detail what they're looking for, and the AI's "Shopping Graph" will "browse for inspiration, think through considerations, and narrow down products."</p><p>Google Search itself received a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">Project Astra</a> update, letting users speak to Gemini as it looks at the world through your camera.

While they haven't mentioned their source, the spec sheet seems quite thorough.</p><p>To start, the publication notes that the phone's cover display could be a bit larger than the previous model, measuring 6.4 inches. This could be due to the rumored reduction of the cover display’s bezel and the potential reworking of the hinge.  Additionally, the leak suggests that the cover display is also getting a brightness upgrade of up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, a 10% increase from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-changed-my-mind-about-foldables-but-i-still-prefer-flip-phones">Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</a></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-closed" alt="A leaked rendering of the alleged Pixel 10 Pro Fold in a Porcelain color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking about the device's battery, the leak suggests that it will show up with the largest non-silicon carbon battery, with 5,015mAh capacity and a bump from the 4,460mAh of the previous model. Which means users with this new foldable could use it for a couple more hours than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The massive battery will supposedly get a 23W wired, 15W wireless (with Qi2) charging compatibility.</p><p>As many previous rumors have indicated, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold might be powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> 3nm chipset. However, things remain unchanged when it comes to the phone's camera. According to the website, the phone will sport a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, and a 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto camera. It will also have 10-megapixel selfie cameras on the cover as well as the main display.</p><p>As for the device's storage, the phone might see a higher 1TB option of this foldable, as indicated by a previous leak as well. And these storage options could also be linked to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">color users choose for their device.</a></p><p>Lastly, Android Headlines claims that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be the first ever foldable to get an IP68 dust and water rating, which is much higher than the Samsung Z Fold 7's rating as well.</p><p>That said, as real as this may seem, this is still just a leak and must be taken with a grain of salt. However, the wait isn't for that long as Google officially announced that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-officially-sets-a-date-for-its-pixel-10-launch-event">Pixel 10 series would be unveiled on Aug. 20 in New York.</a></p> ]]></dc:content>

We've had rumors about the former for a while, but this render suggests there are a couple of key changes inbound. First, the render purports some rather noticeable bezels around the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra, seemingly similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">the Tab S10 Ultra</a>.</p><p>However, the tipster's image claims the tablet could see a slightly redesigned selfie camera cutout. Instead of the more boxy look, the Tab S11 Ultra render shows a smaller Infinity-U reminiscent display cutout. It looks like what you'd find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">budget Galaxy A26</a>. It remains to be seen if this new cutout takes away one of the Ultra's two selfie cameras or not. For reference, the Tab S11 Ultra features a 13MP wide and an 8MP ultrawide selfie lens.</p><p>The Tab S11 Ultra's rear panel appears mostly the same—clean and clear—but there's one thing missing: the S Pen holder. Other users took note of this, as well, on X (formerly Twitter). It's kicked off some speculation, with some wondering if Samsung moved the strip to the top (side) of the tablet.</p><p>The tipster also highlighted the Galaxy S25 FE, which seems pretty much identical to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">the Galaxy S25</a> series. The only difference is that Samsung seems to have placed silver rings around its triple camera array, rather than the thicker black rings of the flagship models.</p><h2 id="more-samsung-2">More Samsung</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">GTS11U / GS25FE pic.twitter.com/yyqVXhzi6z<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1945437427692093702">July 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Rumors about Samsung's next tablet series have been pretty light, other than theories <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">that it's dropping the Plus</a>, bringing only the base and Ultra models. The Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra was reportedly spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-surfaces-stronger-mediatek-database-leaks">moving through Geekbench</a> for its performance tests, and it's said the model sports the boosted MediaTek Dimensity 9400 Plus chip. The chip is a refresh of MediaTek's answer to the Snapdragon 8 Elite from Qualcomm; however, the Tab S11 Ultra supposedly received a score "lower than smartphones."</p><p>The Tab S11 Ultra might also see a battery boost. There was a report that claimed the tablet could jump 500mAh to ~11,374mAh.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Galaxy S25 FE was allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-wpc-listing-qi2-info-real-life-image-report">spotted grabbing Qi2 certification</a>, but the kicker was the WPC's real-life leaked snapshot of the phone. We got a clearer look at the phone's rear panel (and kind of the display), which showed off that small camera array change.</p><p>Samsung's summer Unpacked just went by, so we're looking ahead. The Galaxy S25 FE has been rumored to launch with the Galaxy Tab S11 series, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">reportedly happening "shortly." </a>There's a chance we could see these devices in August or September. The latter option is closer to the company's 2024 tablet reveal.</p><ul><li><strong>Tablet deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ipad-tablets-ereaders/tablets/pcmcat209000050008.c?id=pcmcat209000050008"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=tablet"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/tablets-laptops-computers-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablet&crid=2HCFROTF588S1&sprefix=tablet%2Caps%2C159&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/tablet"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong></strong></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The improved heart rate sensor is substantially more accurate than that of the Watch 6, which is a good reason on its own to snag the watch while it's a little cheaper. It also boasts highly addictive double pinch gestures, health monitoring additions like medication interaction warnings, and a broad swath of Galaxy AI features that make it great.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$329.99" data-dimension48="$329.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQ3MML" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="5fkfzAa3nceSUcsYgLmsYP" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fkfzAa3nceSUcsYgLmsYP.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQ3MML" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$329.99" data-dimension48="$329.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$329.99</del> <strong>$199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>After this year's installment of Amazon Prime Day, the retailer has kept a solid 39% discount on the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a>, representing a whopping $130 off the normal purchase price.

My Galaxy Watch 8 review unit, running One UI 8 Watch, had it from day one, so I've been testing it to see how the experience compares to the old Google Assistant or using Gemini on my phone.</p><p>Gemini recognizes natural language commands more dynamically, provides custom Google Search LLM responses instead of "Here's something I found" summaries, and syncs directly with your Google or Samsung apps so you can (for example) create a Google Calendar reminder or YouTube Music playlist via command.</p><p>My Pixel Watch 3 still runs Google Assistant at the time I'm writing this, so it became my control group against my Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's Gemini. And while I can't say my Gemini experience was perfect, it's certainly a major improvement.</p><h2 id="gemini-on-wear-os-is-a-noticeable-upgrade-over-assistant-2">Gemini on Wear OS is a noticeable upgrade over Assistant</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="MEBXRp5fzKVXhMdffXZHb3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-vs-Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Assistant" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (left) showing a Gemini summary about antioxidant-rich foods, and the Google Pixel Watch 3 (right) showing an Assistant summary on this topic." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MEBXRp5fzKVXhMdffXZHb3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3276" height="1843" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (left) showing a Gemini summary about antioxidant-rich foods, and the Google Pixel Watch 3 (right) showing an Assistant summary on this topic. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's a relevant example. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 8</a> has a new antioxidant index that measures carotenoids, the pigments in fruits and veggies that help prevent premature aging and chronic illnesses. So I asked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and Assistant which foods have the most carotenoids.</p><p>Assistant unhelpfully quoted a Mayo Clinic article that confirmed "fruits, vegetables, and whole grains" have carotenoids. Gemini gave actual specifics, then let me create a Google Keep shopping list with the suggested produce pasted.</p><p>I'm also able to ask random on-the-spot questions about things like "the history of carrier pigeons in 30 seconds" and get a relevant, concise answer. I like to skip past the Search AI summary to the actual articles on my laptop browser, but this LLM data is well-suited to on-the-go insights.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="e5zrKQnTcq9xMKxpGQhdC4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Google-Keep-list" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a Gemini-created carotenoid-rich foods list added to Google Keep." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e5zrKQnTcq9xMKxpGQhdC4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My friend told me he loved the new Superman movie, so I asked both assistants about the critical reception. Google Assistant quoted a pithy Rotten Tomatoes' summary, while Gemini offered more nuance and detail about which aspects reviewers liked and disliked.</p><p>More importantly, I asked Gemini for showtimes at my closest theater on Saturday — it pulled data from Search and Maps simultaneously, then had it create a Google Calendar entry for a specific showing and send my fiancée an invite. Google Assistant can do a lot of this <em>individually</em>, but can't multitask in the same way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YhUq95hTSJW3UAhbpTAWS4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-calendar-entry" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the Gemini app creating a Google Calendar entry for the movie Superman." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YhUq95hTSJW3UAhbpTAWS4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini asks Galaxy Watch owners which app they want to default to, such as Samsung Reminders / Google Tasks or Google / Samsung Messages. Once you choose your default apps and give Gemini access, everything speeds up. I had Gemini create reminders, summarize emails, and search for a good nearby Italian restaurant before opening walking directions to it.</p><p>Google Assistant also has some integration with Google apps; Gemini isn't reinventing the wheel. But Gemini does do things more seamlessly and has fewer instances where it "doesn't understand" or can't fulfill my request.</p><h2 id="how-gemini-on-wear-os-can-get-even-better-2">How Gemini on Wear OS can get even better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Tile" alt="The Gemini widget on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini on Wear OS feels pretty polished, considering it's only just launched. I worried about its battery impact, but dozens of Gemini commands and the always-listening "Hey Google" setting only burned about 20% of my Watch 8 Classic battery across a full afternoon. That's faster than normal drain, but even heavy use won't stop you from getting over a day per charge.</p><p>That said, I think Gemini on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> can get even better! It occasionally gets things wrong and has leaps in logic, but that's normal for LLMs. I have more concrete requests.</p><p>I started adding "in 30 seconds" to info requests because Gemini's long, meandering answers take minutes to read, which isn't always suitable when out and about. Tapping the display silences the AI so you can read the full answer yourself, but I think this version of Gemini might focus more on brevity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="a73pnnnWfMtTm4Q5Y8XtK4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-website-links" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a Gemini response with websites for a nearby restaurant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a73pnnnWfMtTm4Q5Y8XtK4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There should be a "View on phone" button at the bottom of Gemini replies. The mobile Gemini often shows relevant hyperlinks when, for example, you search for good nearby Indian restaurants, but the Wear OS Gemini typically sticks to text summaries. Sometimes it'll share hyperlinks that open on your phone if asked directly, but more often it gets confused.</p><p>However, as dynamic as this version of Gemini is, there does come a point when pulling out my phone is less time-consuming, and Wear OS should make that transition easier.</p><p>Also, unlike the more conversational <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>, the Gemini assistant can be bad at knowing when I'm done talking, cutting me off mid-command or halfway through a message. I understand that people don't want to wait around too long, but the AI should be a little more patient.</p><p>Lastly, if and when Google starts supporting the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-galaxy-watch-8-tiles-are-best-part-of-one-ui-8-watch">One UI 8 Watch Tile format</a> for its own apps, I'd like to see a scrolling Gemini Tile with room for more than two saved commands; ideally, it'd show your recent commands, too, so you could pick up where you left off.</p><p>Overall, replacing Assistant with Gemini is a major net positive. I simply hope that Google continues to optimize this version of the assistant in future updates!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ced8c3e7-59dd-4ce6-86dc-42f4ef06ddd0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4tmhPs8yGBuoHYFfdrVvW6.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>New kind of Classic</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic isn't the only Wear OS watch with Gemini, but its fast processor is primed to answer questions speedily, and you'll read responses on its 3,000-nit display.

The post states the update has started as of July 15, and is expected to "reach all devices over the coming weeks." While the OnePlus 13 and 13R don't feature the dedicated Plus Key like the 13s, the post states users with the former can activate Plus Mind using a "three-finger swipe up" on their displays.</p><p>As the update appears, users will soon notice a new Mind Space app appear on the 13 and 13R. Details highlight your ability to send a "wide variety" of information into Plus Mind. OnePlus states this includes your texts, images, webpages, social media posts, and more. What you capture via the screen gesture will be sent to the Mind Space app.</p><p>Additionally, the AI analysis of your content can spot and understand dates and suggest that you put them into your calendar for later.</p><p>For fashion, OnePlus says Plus Mind can "summarize the styles shown" and save that summary within Mind Space with a direct link, so you can revisit it. If there's a lot of content in your Mind Space app, OnePlus says you can leverage AI Search on the 13 and 13R to find things. Knowing the gist of what you're looking for, and also <em>when </em>you might've saved it, can help the AI return useful stored content.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-smart-one-2">It's a smart one</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WA2j9mRQcKQGWBPHfgbgRF" name="OnePlus-AI-Plus-Key" alt="OnePlus AI Plus Key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WA2j9mRQcKQGWBPHfgbgRF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When the OnePlus 13s was on its way, it was made evident that the company had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">ditched the Alert Slider</a> in favor of a new Plus Key. As previously stated, the feature primarily focuses on your screenshots—and placing them in a unique space (Mind Space), so they're not cluttering your memories in the Gallery. Plus Mind's AI suggestions piggyback off OnePlus AI to make saving important dates, locations, and more a breeze.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-launching-in-india-on-july-5">compact flagship is available in India</a>, which meant the rest of us were left waiting (and wondering) if we'd ever see something similar. Users in India are also enjoying AI VoiceScribe, a feature that lets users record, summarize, and translate phone calls and meetings. The Chinese OEM's AI suite has continued to evolve, as we have AI Translation, Search, Reframe, and Perfect Shot to play with.</p><p>However, OnePlus states that there's "more to come," and Plus Mind on the 13 and 13R is a "step in that direction."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Vivo proved last year that it knows how to deliver an all-round package with a sleek design, amazing cameras, and good software features.</p><p>With the X Fold 5, it isn't changing things too much; if anything, the phone is nearly identical to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold 3 Pro</a>. Coming in at 4.3mm, it is among the thinnest tech products you can buy today, but it just misses out on being the thinnest foldable — that honor goes to the 4.2mm Magic V5.</p><p>However, Vivo put a bigger 6,000mAh battery in its foldable, and that ensures the device easily lasts a day even with heavy use. And at 217g, it is 12g lighter than the X200 Ultra, and that in itself highlights just how much foldables have evolved in recent years. Like last year, Vivo is making the X Fold 5 available in several Asian countries, but it won't debut outside the region.</p><p>Having used the X Fold 5 as my daily driver, I'm convinced that it is one of the best foldables you can buy in 2025 — provided you're in a country where Vivo sells the device.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x-fold-5-specs-pricing-and-availability"><span>Vivo X Fold 5: Specs, pricing, and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BQpjW4NAoER92Jcar75qD3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BQpjW4NAoER92Jcar75qD3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo unveiled the X Fold 5 alongside the new X200 FE on July 14, and the devices are slated to go on sale in select Asian countries over the coming weeks.

Vivo says it is about delivering the right "balance and efficiency," but the manufacturer didn't go into detail as to why it didn't use the 3nm-based 8 Elite over the 4nm 8 Gen 3. It's entirely likely that it wanted to undercut Samsung and Honor, so it utilized last year's platform.</p><p>Thankfully, the 8 Gen 3 still has plenty of power, and I didn't see any slowdowns in the week I used the X Fold 5. It handled demanding games and visually-intensive titles without any issues, and I didn't see much in the way of overheating either. That said, it tends to throttle significantly earlier than regular phones powered by the same silicon.

The ultra-thin design and great in-hand feel is the main reason why I'll continue to use the X Fold 5 after the review, and it just feels like a regular phone most of the time — with the added benefit of an 8.03-inch fold-out panel.</p><p>If you've convinced yourself to get a foldable this year, don't bother with Samsung — the X Fold 5 is a much better choice in just about every area.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="439d8dbd-af21-40da-81dc-aa4ee43da572">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FninbrNUf9aaAXuBQjsCwL.jpg' alt="Vivo X Fold 5"><span class='featured__label hero__label'>Vivo X Fold 5</span></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title"></div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With an ultra-thin design and fabulous cameras, the X Fold 5 proves that it is the foldable to beat in 2025.

Compare that to your current phone bill and tell me it doesn't sound good. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/phone-plans/12-month-plans/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d82427d5-ec0f-4872-9a51-0ec91469d5bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile" data-dimension48="Get 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want Unlimited wireless for dirt cheap; you don&apos;t mind paying for a full year of service in advance.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t want to commit to a year of one wireless plan; you need more perks or you regularly use over 35GB of data in a month. </p><p>Owned and operated by T-Mobile, Mint Mobile is a popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carrier</a> that works by selling its wireless in 3, 6, and 12-month increments of time. Although you have to pay a bit more for the wireless upfront, it generally becomes quite cheap once you break the costs down month to month. This makes Mint a convenient choice for folks who want to drop a chunk of cash and not think about their phone bill again for a while.</p><p>As described above, the Unlimited plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile&apos;s vast 5G network. High-speed data is technically capped at 35GB per month, after which speeds <em>could</em> slow if the network becomes congested. Aside from a free mobile hotspot and a few international benefits, there also aren&apos;t as many perks as you might get from other wireless carriers, but that&apos;s a small price to pay when you consider the value here. </p><p>I&apos;ll put it this way: Mint is a simple, affordable carrier for folks who want simple, affordable wireless. And if you&apos;ve been thinking about switching anyway, this deal presents an outstanding opportunity. </p><h2 id="need-a-new-phone-too-2">Need a new phone too?</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e4f03dbe-b4ed-498c-8893-2a6492d77f69" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:204px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:121.08%;"><img id="Y8nScb7AAtxK4j2d2EnxjV" name="google-pixel-9-render-obsidian.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y8nScb7AAtxK4j2d2EnxjV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="204" height="247" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 9 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" data-dimension112="e4f03dbe-b4ed-498c-8893-2a6492d77f69" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799"><del>$799</del> <strong>$359, plus BOGO year of Unlimited at Mint Mobile</strong></a></p><p>Mint is also home to a ton of great phone deals, such as this offer that slashes over 50% off the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> AND throws in a free year of Unlimited when you bundle the purchase of the phone with one year of service.</p><p>In other words, you're getting a top-rated flagship phone along with two full years of T-Mobile-powered wireless for only $719 (or $30 per month when you pay using affirm). <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e4f03dbe-b4ed-498c-8893-2a6492d77f69" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div><ul><li> <strong>More MVNO deals: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.boostmobile.com/mypromo/trial-mybm"><u><strong>Boost</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans"><u><strong>Tello</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans"><u><strong>Cricket</strong></u></a> </li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The survey runs through the typical checks and balances; however, the publication noticed two important questions, each regarding Qi2 wireless charging and its magnetic hardware.</p><p>Arguably, the most important question is number 38, which says, "Would you prefer to have magnets built into the phone even if it made the phone thicker?" Two of the answers say you wouldn't mind Qi2 magnets within the device, even if it made the phone "within 0.3mm" or "within 0.5mm" larger. These aren't outlandish differences, especially considering Samsung's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">thin phone era</a>, but that tech inside would <em>slightly </em>enlarge things.</p><p>The publication details another option that says you wouldn't want Qi2 magnets inside if it made the phone larger, while the final choice says "magnets must be included," no matter the increase.</p><p>The other question poses an interesting scenario: what if a Galaxy phone <em>only </em>had wireless charging? Samsung asks, "if only wireless charging is supported, would having Qi2 (like MagSafe) reduce any inconveniences?"</p><h2 id="samsung-qi2-2">Samsung & Qi2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87" name="magsafe-ring-adapter-silicone-case-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Silicone Case with MagSafe ring and PopSocket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's recent history with Qi2 on the Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">has been incredibly confusing</a>, but it all boils down to a simple answer.

So, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">yes, the Galaxy S25 series offers wireless charging</a>, thanks to Qi2, but only at 15W.</p><p>If you're interested in grabbing a Qi2 charger, the Galaxy S25 series will be compatible with it. One thing you should note is that, without the magnets, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">you will need a case</a> that brings the necessary built-in magnets for that.</p><p>Perhaps we can speculate that Samsung dropped these magnets to make its series thinner, especially after seeing the recent consumer survey. That's not exactly confirmed, so it's just food for thought. There's also no telling when/if Samsung would even provide built-in magnets for its devices. The Galaxy S26 series comes to mind. We'd only hear something actionable early next year, if it does.</p><p>The company's rumored Galaxy S25 FE was recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-wpc-listing-qi2-info-real-life-image-report">spotted moving through the WPC</a> for wireless charging, to which it received Qi2 (v2.1) certification. However, given speculation that says we might see this phone later this year, we might not see these built-in magnets for this model. If anything, the S25 FE will fit closer to the others with 15W wireless charging and the necessity for a case.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Kang praised the foldables, stating they are "perfect hardware innovations that perfectly complete the first generation of foldables and open up the next generation."</p><p>One of the most substantial changes occurred within the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, which thinned down to 8.9mm (unfolded) and 4.2mm (folded). Kang states this was a product of consumers wanting something "thin and light." However, Samsung understands that not everyone may enjoy its sacrifices: notably, the S Pen. Samsung is reportedly looking into R&D means for new technologies within a future S Pen to make it thinner.</p><p>For now, Kang states consumers should look at the Fold 7 as a "trade-off," adding, "where you lose one if you choose one."</p><p>The publication highlights Kang's additional statement, claiming Samsung won't do anything that sticks until there's a certain level of "perfection." Moreover, "consumer demand" is another major catalyst behind the S Pen's potential return. The post mentions the Fold 7's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-flagship-launch-flip-7-fe">Armor Flex Hinge</a>, which is lighter and thinner than the Fold 6's hinge, further facilitating a slimmer phone.</p><h2 id="the-s-pen-lingers-2">The S Pen lingers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-32" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hinges hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Flip 7 was also discussed, as Samsung finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-flagship-launch-flip-7-fe">provided it with a full cover display</a> (4-inch) that reaches edge-to-edge for a more immersive experience. Samsung worked in a more "compact" form factor for the device, while also boosting its battery by ~300mAh to 4,300mAh.</p><p>You may remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-flagship-foldable-production-rumors">some earlier rumors</a> that said the Galaxy Z Fold 7 would debut with a standalone S Pen that required charging. That didn't happen. The reason for this memory jog is that rumors claimed this S Pen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-fold-phone-might-work-with-an-s-pen-you-need-to-charge">would need to be charged</a> (since there's no digitizer), <em>and </em>the pen would be slightly larger. Speculation claimed Samsung was looking into adding active electrostatic (AES) technology so the pen could manage its own operations. Such additions would likely expand its size, but taking into account Kang's comments, perhaps Samsung is moving in a different direction.</p><p>For now, our current reality is this: the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has no S Pen. If you're interested in that useful tool, you'll have to look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">the Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Samsung's executive vice president and head of customer experience, Patrick Chomet, once told CNET, "We could put it in, but it's not the main feedback from people, and therefore getting it thinner and lighter is more important."</p><p>This pretty much echoes what Kang Min-seok said after Samsung's summer Unpacked. Chomet added, "Many people use the S Pen, but far from the majority of users."</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Since it’s coming from Google’s own AI, it looks totally above board, which means most folks won’t even think to question it. That false sense of trust is what makes this so dangerous.</p><p>According to BleepingComputer, even though prompt injection has been on the radar since 2024 and some guardrails are already in place, this tactic still works. That means the current defenses aren’t quite keeping up with how crafty attackers are getting.</p><p>Google says there’s no sign of hackers actually using this trick in real-world attacks thus far. But the research clearly shows it can be done, which raises a big red flag. Just because it hasn’t hit the wild yet doesn’t mean it’s not a serious threat waiting to happen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The convertible design means that you can transform the laptop into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">a powerful tablet</a> in an instant, and it also clocks in at just over three pounds, making it the perfect device for tossing into your backpack or briefcase. </p><p>On the other hand, the Spin 714&apos;s battery life certainly won&apos;t win any awards (it maxes out at just 10 hours on a single charge), and you don&apos;t get a fingerprint reader. That said, these are small sacrifices when you consider the overall experience offered by the Acer laptop, and this $200 discount from Best Buy is simply the cherry on top.  </p> ]]></dc:content>

The company has upgraded the Phone 3 with a faster processor and better cameras. The Phone 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-grabs-snapdragon-8s-gen-4-for-its-upcoming-flagship-phone-3">opted for Qualcomm's</a> Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, instead of the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Skipping all the jargon, Nothing CEO Carl Pei said the chip helps make the phone feel "a lot snappier."</p><p>The phone's rear camera array consists of three 50MP lenses, and Nothing even popped one onto the front. One of the larger changes regards the Phone 3's Glyph Lighting, or rather lack thereof. Nothing has implemented instead its new GlyphMatrix, a smaller circular display on the back of the phone. Users can switch between a battery indicator, a stopwatch, a mirror, a digital clock, a solar clock, and more on this Matrix.</p><p>The Headphone 1, the company's first over-ear headset, features a set of physical buttons, a paddle, and roller control. It feels a little more retro, but with Nothing's eye-catching design. The Headphone 1 packs ANC that can adapt to your surroundings, so you're tunes never feel out of... tune.</p><h2 id="committing-to-the-phone-3-2">Committing to the Phone 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="XCAUZSvDwAK6rYDD9YsERR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XCAUZSvDwAK6rYDD9YsERR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In June, amidst Nothing's preparations for the Phone 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-android-os-upgrades-five-year-confirmation">the company confirmed</a> that it is going to provide five major Android OS upgrades for the device.

During launch, the company stated this update would arrive sometime in Q3 2025.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d5cee1ec-12ed-4327-9a69-080bed9cedca">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LdeEWY6LkaLEKRNnhJp4dY.jpg' alt="An official product render of the black Nothing Phone 3"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Phone 3 is Nothing's "true flagship," boasting notable CPU and GPU improvements over the company's past-gen model.

It's convenient to scroll through relevant information, such as your Samsung Health goals, current weather, or calendar reminders, without opening each app individually. But it can also feel tedious to scroll through a dozen tiles to find the one bit of information you need.</p><p>With One UI 8 Watch on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 8 series</a>, Samsung has made themed Tile groupings that take better advantage of the watch display space; they feel so natural that I can't believe it hasn't been tried before now.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-new-take-on-wear-os-tiles-2">Samsung's new take on Wear OS Tiles</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gzT3mvz7oAhE7igu6RdvME" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Fitness-Tile" alt="The Fitness Tile on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing four workout options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gzT3mvz7oAhE7igu6RdvME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I rotate my Classic bezel once, and I see a "Health" Tile with my daily goals, Energy score, Sleep, Breathing exercises, and ECGs.

So you can still give an important app a "full" Tile space, but group other apps below it, if you prefer.</p><p>Unfortunately, Google and third-party apps only have traditional, full-Tile layouts; they don't appear as an option when you edit multi-app Tiles. The Gemini tile, for example, already has the Wear OS 6 look, with rounded edges and finite space for two saved commands.</p><p>I assume (or at least hope) Samsung will let other Wear OS app developers make their own mini-Tile views. Because they've become an instant favorite, allowing me to fit more apps into my routine without having to commit an <em>entire</em> Tile to something I won't use every day.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-and-pixel-watch-4-took-two-different-tile-paths-2">The Galaxy Watch 8 and Pixel Watch 4 took two different Tile paths</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a5EjfN7gpNfWueZfXrEVRG" name="Wear-OS-6-Google-Home" alt="The new Google Home tile on Wear OS 6 on the Pixel Watch 3, showing options to check your Kitchen, Thermo, Custom, Doorbell, and Bedroom controls." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a5EjfN7gpNfWueZfXrEVRG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="m23b4XmgZ7iRAitHxemYX9" name="Wear-OS-6-Gmail" alt="The new Gmail tile for "Your mail" on Wear OS 6 on the Pixel Watch 3, showing two emails about lunch and dinner from different contacts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m23b4XmgZ7iRAitHxemYX9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3864" height="2173" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3651px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ouoJQnbvKuG5jyCyzkp4nF" name="Wear-OS-6-weather" alt="The new Weather tile on Wear OS 6, showing three narrow tiles for Now, 5PM, and 6PM temperatures in London." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ouoJQnbvKuG5jyCyzkp4nF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3651" height="2054" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2990px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YcUnxsaZ9dN3FXm9rwZWKV" name="Wear-OS-6-Contacts" alt="The Contacts Tile on Wear OS 6 on the Pixel Watch 3, showing different contact icons for individual numbers and an All Contacts button on the bottom edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YcUnxsaZ9dN3FXm9rwZWKV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2990" height="1682" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-tested-early-wear-os-6-build-on-pixel-watch-3-at-google-io-2025">tried out Wear OS 6 at Google I/O</a>, I was impressed by Google's redesigned Tiles because they took full advantage of the display space. You can avoid opening individual apps because the Tile will jump-start your search for the most relevant information or shortcuts.</p><p>Now that I've seen Samsung's take on Wear OS 6, I find this fundamental difference fascinating. Samsung's Tiles system feels much more like customizing your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> home screen so that you can swipe left to your organized apps and widgets. Google's UI is more self-contained, designed for watches with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/material-3-expressive-is-return-to-form-pixel-watch-4-needs">Material 3 Expressive</a> aesthetic as inspiration.</p><p>This may just be recency bias talking, but my preference has shifted to Samsung's Tiles. For one, I prefer seeing more information at once, even if it's smaller. For another, I find it easier to scroll <em>down</em> through one themed Health tile and decide which option to tap, rather than have to memorize my Tile order and settle on one thing at a time.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="DLCGjr9DFQ9njdP3sthmNE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Tile-size-options" alt="The "Add Tile" view on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing two sizes of Antioxidant Index widget." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DLCGjr9DFQ9njdP3sthmNE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Two Tile size options for the Antioxidant Index metric </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Tile" alt="The Gemini widget on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">One fixed size option for the Gemini Tile </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I'm not writing off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> UI until I thoroughly test it.

Once created to solve a problem, temporal dithering has created its own monster of a problem that's slowly infecting new and old devices alike, rendering them unusable to a portion of the population, and Android users have had enough.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use. It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>On July 9, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/430486442">an official bug report was filed</a> to Google's Android issue tracker system, outlining the ways that system-wide temporal dithering was negatively affecting users. The symptoms sound an awful lot like an article I wrote <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">over two years ago</a> about how the flickering effects of PWM dimming were causing me headaches and making me nauseous.</p><p>However, unlike PWM dimming, temporal dithering can be introduced to a phone after purchase, sometimes years later. Apple's iPhones are among the worst offenders of this tactic, forcing users to find ways to "downgrade" the iOS version to an older one (often iOS 17) or face debilitating issues.</p><p>Plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are at fault too, and while Android users have a far wider range of choice than Apple provides, the list of phones that are both <em>certified flicker-free</em> and the ones that <strong>don't</strong> use temporal dithering has dwindled to near-zero. Now, it's time for Google to put in the work for new accessibility options to help an entire swath of users from having to put down smartphones altogether.</p><h2 id="what-is-temporal-dithering-2">What is temporal dithering?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6f5Yowxok7cNyyvVtfY6eS" name="dithering-testing-using-microscrope-on-honor-tablet-01" alt="Testing to see if the Honor Pad V9 uses temporal dithering by using a OnePlus 13's 480FPS slow motion video and a Carson MicroFlip smartphone microscope" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6f5Yowxok7cNyyvVtfY6eS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Displays are usually made up of millions of pixels, all individually displaying colors that make up the images we see on our phones. To make these colors, pixels adjust the hue each of their red, green, or blue colored subpixels. Think of it a bit like when Bob Ross dips his paintbrush into a crimson red, then an azure blue to make some kind of lovely purple for a mountainscape.</p><p>But temporal dithering, also known as FRC or Frame Rate Control, is different. Instead of just showing a solid set of colors to create one color, temporal dithering flashes subpixels back and forth between colors to create a color that doesn't exist. Your eye sees this "new" color because that's how the human eye works. Flash something fast enough in front of one, and it starts seeing a solid or moving image instead of a series of flashing images.</p><p>It's a clever engineering trick that saves companies R&D dollars, allowing them to use cheaper panels and still get away with saying their phones or displays show "billions of colors," even if they technically can't. But of course, just as is the case with PWM dimming, displaying a flashing light or color to some people will cause them to get headaches, nausea, or, at worst, a seizure.</p><h2 id="avoiding-it-is-nearly-impossible-2">Avoiding it is nearly impossible</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fvNWBxgkDjJ6KhdDS5KeaS" name="dithering-testing-using-microscrope-on-honor-tablet-02" alt="Testing to see if the Honor Pad V9 uses temporal dithering by using a OnePlus 13's 480FPS slow motion video and a Carson MicroFlip smartphone microscope" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fvNWBxgkDjJ6KhdDS5KeaS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>People sensitive to temporal dithering have a much harder time finding suitable devices for three main reasons. First, while some monitor companies readily list FRC on spec sheets, smartphone companies do not.</p><p>That means the only way to know if a phone or tablet uses dithering is by either experiencing symptoms or finding a review that dives deep into the display. I try to include these numbers on any review I publish, but I'm just one person, and there are far too many devices for me to be able to test on my own.</p><p>Aside from finding the existence of flickering itself, there's no published rate at which these pixels flicker. At least with PWM dimming, most manufacturers now advertise the existence of PWM dimming and the dimming rate. Phones from brands like Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel run at a very slow 240-480Hz rate, while other brands like OnePlus and Honor push that number up to between 2160Hz and 4320Hz. The faster, the better for humans.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ibisLkmWgzvsbXc5DkEa3C" name="iqoo-z10-neo-eye-care-settings" alt="Eye protection settings on the Iqoo Z10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ibisLkmWgzvsbXc5DkEa3C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No one knows how fast pixels flash when temporal dithering is used, outside of the engineering teams that create the algorithms, of course. Because of this, there's no way to know which phones have a "safe" level of flickering and which are bad for you. All we know is that when phones employ temporal dithering, some users experience real pain and cannot use those phones.</p><p>Lastly, there's no specific color, app, or even activity on the phone that could trigger temporal dithering to activate. Some companies use temporal dithering around the edge of text to make it smoother or more "readable," while other companies may use it to enhance animations and make them more attractive looking. It's a total mixed bag, and it makes figuring out the right phone an extraordinarily difficult process if you're sensitive to it!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="GPQxq6ULrrsVCE5YV6cHtP" name="temporal-dithering-example-oled" alt="An example comparing OLED panels that use color dithering/FRC to another panel that does not" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GPQxq6ULrrsVCE5YV6cHtP.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you want to test for yourself, I recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Carson-Microscope-Smartphone-Digiscoping-MP-250/dp/B015MS8O48/">this $20 smartphone microscope</a> from Amazon. Find a phone that can do at least 240FPS slow motion video capture — I prefer the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> because both phones can capture 480FPS slow motion — and run the microscope over different parts of the screen.</p><p>I often test around the edges of text, on different icons on the home screen, and on both a rainbow gradient and a grayscale gradient. If you see pixels "dancing" between colors, it's likely your display dithers. Check out the GIF above to see what it might look like, as an example.</p><p>The subpixels on the right side are flashing between two colors constantly, while the display on the left is displaying solid colors. This was captured on what looks to my eyes like a solid color, so this movement isn't the result of an animation on screen.</p><h2 id="what-s-the-solution-2">What's the solution?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Jka6Qc2Xbz5VGGfLnce8Ro" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-nxtvision-settings" alt="Adjusting the NXTVISION settings on an NXTPAPER 4.0-powered TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jka6Qc2Xbz5VGGfLnce8Ro.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most immediate thing you can do <em>right now</em> is hop over to the AOSP issue tracker and click the +1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/430486442">on the temporal dithering issue</a>. If you're affected, share your story in the comments and officially put your name on the tracker. It's like signing a petition, but with a lot more weight behind it. This tells Android engineers that this issue needs to be prioritized in future Android updates. Otherwise, they have no idea there's a problem!</p><p>Now, on to the companies that make the smartphones. Since 10-bit color has become the new industry standard for display excellence, companies need to use 10-bit displays whenever possible. An 8-bit screen can display 256 different shades of red, green, or blue in its subpixels, while a 10-bit screen ramps this up to a possible 1024 hues per subpixel.</p><p>In general, only OLED can properly display 10-bit color without any sort of dithering nonsense. If you see an LCD that claims it's 10-bit, the manufacturer is likely being misleading. Even many 8-bit LCDs use 6-bit panels and employ FRC/dithering to achieve an 8-bit or 10-bit color palette.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aZsffDvc8HtLMyGPmSzt8d" name="mudita-kompact-vs-minimal-phone-back-cameras-03" alt="Comapring the camera software on the Minimal Phone to the Mudita Kompakt" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZsffDvc8HtLMyGPmSzt8d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The problem with OLED is that it cannot be fully DC-dimmed like a traditional lightbulb. There is no such thing as a completely flicker-free OLED. It's impossible. Instead, there are "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">safe ranges</a>" that exist for most users, but a subset of users will never be able to use OLED because of this problem.</p><p>Those folks <em>need</em> an accessibility option that allows them to disable dithering or FRC completely. Otherwise, the only safe options are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/an-e-ink-phone-isnt-something-you-just-switch-to-in-one-day">E Ink phones</a>, and all of those have some sort of significant limitations for modern workflows or usages. I recently wrote about how TCL has removed temporal dithering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/tcl-nxtpaper-4-fixes-one-of-the-technologys-biggest-hidden-issues">on its latest NXTPAPER 4.0 tablets</a> when using specific settings, and we need to see other manufacturers start doing the same.</p><p>This is particularly important for LCDs, as users who are the most sensitive to flicker either have to choose between an LCD or an E Ink device. Introducing something like FRC/dithering to an LCD completely defeats the point of these displays as a safe medium, and both hardware manufacturers and OS developers like Google need to implement ways of turning this off completely.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5zAVBxAPszK4664MpG9UeC" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-vs-honor-pad-v9-home-screens" alt="Comparing the displays between the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus and the Honor Pad V9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5zAVBxAPszK4664MpG9UeC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The aforementioned Android bug report has already been assigned to an engineer and tagged as a "feature request" in hopes of getting a new accessibility option for affected users. Google has had accessibility options in place for color blind users for years, which statistically make up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/">less than 4%</a> of the world's population. We don't know the number of people negatively affected by color dithering, but we know that people who <em>are</em> affected by it cannot use any phone with it at all.</p><p>This is an important differentiator between some accessibility options, which are made simply for comfort or convenience reasons, and the one we're asking Google to make. Without this new option, an entire subset of users may be unable to use any Android phones at all, especially as support for older phones ends.</p><p>Android is, by far, the world's largest operating system, and that statistic isn't changing anytime soon. Now that we know Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-exec-android-gemini-future-os-interview-report">is combining ChromeOS and Android</a>, that number is only going to get higher. Now is the time to act, Google. I know you can do it, and now that you know it's a problem, I hope it's only a matter of time before we get a fix.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e8f55126-665c-4040-82a7-4eb43977e555">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zcr4Z8qwujAeqMm5gfzGGn.jpg' alt="An official render of the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet's display and rear camera module"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>TCL's latest tablet employs NXTPAPER 4.0, the newest evolution in TCL's unique ePaper display that features even better eye comfort modes than previous generations.

The partnership doesn’t mean the navigation system in Rivian cars is just Google Maps; instead, it is built on it.

Then there’s charging score, which is Rivian’s unique score derived from individual charging sites, based on plug-in data from the company’s vehicles, giving information on how reliable a charge station is.</p><p>All in all, Rivian users can experience a refreshed map look with enhanced natural spaces in its topography and colors, and have easy glanceability. Lastly, the mobile app also includes all-new place photos, place descriptions, and Satellite view (with a Connect+ subscription), and the ability to see traffic and traffic incidents. Also, riders will be able to share destinations and trips from the mobile app to the vehicle and outside the app via Google Maps.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That’s according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-google-pixel-watch-4-specs-leak-3577020/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, which says the next-gen watch is set to run on the same aging silicon.</p><p>If this checks out, that would make it three straight years of Google recycling the same chip in its Pixel Watch lineup.</p><p>Notwithstanding, it's hard to write off the Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 just yet, as it’s still holding its own.

The 45mm model goes by the codename “kenari” (FK23), and the 41mm one is called “meridian” (FME23)—both nods to Star Wars planets, which is a fun shift from Google’s usual god-themed names.</p><p>As usual, expect both LTE and Wi-Fi-only versions for each size.</p><p>Google might be putting in the work to squeeze out every drop of efficiency. The report notes a slight battery bump for both Pixel Watch 4 models: a 7% boost for the 41mm and a 9% jump for the 45mm with a 459mAh cell. It’s not a huge leap, but it could help stretch out battery life just a bit more on Google’s next-gen watch.</p><p>Additionally, faster charging is reportedly on the way. If true, it should cut down charge times even more, which is a nice step forward from previous Pixel Watch models.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This discovery, powered by insights from the Google Threat Intelligence Group, shows how AI can now catch bugs before they blow up.</p><p>Big Sleep was built to think like a human security expert, digging through code and spotting shady behaviors just like a real researcher would. Google also designed it to catch sneaky twists on known bugs, which are a goldmine for hackers looking to mess with modern software.</p><p>Additionally, Google’s open-source digital forensics tool, Timesketch, is getting a powerful AI boost. Backed by a new model called Sec-Gemini, the upgraded platform can now do some of the heavy lifting in forensic investigations, like sifting through logs and flagging potential threats. This means less work for analysts and much faster incident response. A live demo is set for Black Hat USA.</p><h2 id="facade-google-s-secret-insider-threat-catcher-2">FACADE: Google’s secret insider threat catcher</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1466px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="RJDyHw3W2cZ9f9auHorGW" name="android-security.jpg" alt="Android logo on a phone with a padlock in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RJDyHw3W2cZ9f9auHorGW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1466" height="825" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another internal tool is stepping into the spotlight. Google will share a behind-the-scenes look at FACADE, its insider threat detection system that’s been quietly monitoring billions of daily events since 2018. It doesn’t need training data from past attacks to spot anomalies, thanks to a machine learning approach called contrastive learning.</p><p>At DEF CON 33, Google is also co-hosting a Capture the Flag (CTF) event with Airbus. Teams will get help from AI assistants to tackle a wide range of security puzzles. It’s a fresh spin that puts AI in the trenches with security pros and hobbyists alike.</p><p>Google is also putting its weight behind safer AI development. It’s donating data from its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-saif-risk-assessment-security-threats-details">Secure AI Framework</a> (SAIF) to the Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI), helping fuel work around agentic AI, software supply chain security, and cyber defense. This move follows the initiative's launch at last year’s Aspen Security Forum.</p><p>And finally, next month marks the end of the AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC), a DARPA-led competition supported by Google. The winners will show off new AI tools built to find and fix vulnerabilities in major open-source software, a major step forward for proactive digital defense.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are three case sizes in total: 40mm, 44mm, and 46mm. You can get the Galaxy Watch 8 in 40mm or 44mm sizes, with both options available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/which-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-color-should-you-buy">Graphite and Silver colorways</a> each. Meanwhile, the upsized Galaxy Watch 8 Classic with the popular rotating bezel is only available in one 46mm case size. Customers can choose from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/which-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-color-should-you-buy">Black and White color options</a> when shopping for the Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>Choosing the right case size when buying a wearable depends on the size of your wrists. If you've got big hands, a larger case size like 44mm or 46mm, is best suited. Something as small as 40mm may not be proportional and might end up looking strange or funny. You don't want to seem like you accidentally wore a kids' smartwatch.</p><p>Naturally, the petite 40mm case size looks the most aesthetically pleasing on tinier wrists. It's also more functional. You don't want an oversized, chunky wearable that covers the entirety of your wrist, feels heavy, and ends up knocking around every single thing in close proximity to your hands.</p><p>Small wrists have a disadvantage when looking at the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, because it only comes in a gigantic 46mm case size. So you'll be stuck between the Watch 8's 40mm or 44mm variants if you have smaller hands.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This year, Samsung added the best mobile processor, a 200MP main camera sensor, and a refreshed thin-and-light design to its premium Fold. However, Galaxy Z Fold users might have also gotten something they <em>didn't</em> want, and that's the $2,000 starting price of the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>For those keeping track at home, that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> the most expensive Samsung foldable to ever launch in the U.S. It's even pricier than the original Galaxy Z Fold that launched in 2019 for $1,980. Of course, inflation, tariff uncertainty, and a host of other factors might explain the price hike, but this just goes to show that the decision of whether to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is more complicated than ever.</p><p>People considering an upgrade will have to look at their current phone and figure out whether having the newest Samsung foldable is worth the high cost. For anyone with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">recent foldable</a> from Samsung, Google, or OnePlus, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is probably out of reach — unless you take advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-deals">insane pre-order trade-in deals</a>. It's easier to justify an upgrade with an older model because the changes compound across multiple generations.</p><p>Let's dive into the Galaxy Z Fold 7's price and specs to help you figure out whether you should upgrade or pass.</p><h2 id="should-you-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-from-a-galaxy-z-fold-6-2">Should you upgrade to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 from a Galaxy Z Fold 6?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5naTkQoLMYoejCq4GVAp3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-mint-hands-on-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5naTkQoLMYoejCq4GVAp3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> was already a standout foldable, and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 builds off those initial upgrades. Is there enough added to the newer model to make current owners want to upgrade? That probably depends on who you ask. There are a lot of noticeable changes, but it'll be tough to justify spending $2,000 on a foldable just one year after spending $1,900 on the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">major differences between these two models</a> will be their display sizes and form factors. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has bigger inner and outer screens, measuring 8 inches on the main display and 6.5 inches on the cover screen. That's up from a 7.6-inch main screen and a 6.3-inch cover screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Most importantly, the newer model has a wider cover screen, which should make typing and general use more comfortable.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications </caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Folding display</p></td><td  ><p>8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2184 x 1968 QXGA+</p></td><td  ><p>7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2160 x 1856 resolution, 20.9:18 aspect ratio, 374 ppi, 2600 nits peak brightness, 480Hz PWM dimming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover display</p></td><td  ><p>6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 2520 x 1080 HD+, Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2376 x 968 resolution, 22.1:9 aspect ratio, 410 ppi, 2600 nits peak brightness, 480Hz PWM dimming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating System</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (One UI 8)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 14 (One UI 6.1.1) [upgradeable]</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor </p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, or 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, or 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery </p></td><td  ><p>4,400mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,400mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging </p></td><td  ><p>25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 4.5 reverse wireless</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 4.5 reverse wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras </p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 12MP ultrawide + 10MP telephoto (3x optical zoom)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 12MP ultrawide + 10MP telephoto (3x optical zoom)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie cameras </p></td><td  ><p>10MP (cover display) + 10MP (folding display)</p></td><td  ><p>10MP (cover display) + 4MP (folding display)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9 mm (folded); 158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2 mm (unfolded)</p></td><td  ><p>Folded (68.1 x 153.5 x 12.1 mm); Unfolded (132.6 x 153.5 x 5.6 mm)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>215g</p></td><td  ><p>239g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Silver Shadow, Blue Shadow, Jetblack</p></td><td  ><p>Silver, Shadow, Pink, Navy</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is <em>significantly</em> thinner and lighter than its predecessor, which is probably the most compelling reason to upgrade. It's only 8.9mm thick when closed, and that means you can add a case to it if you'd like while still remaining under the Galaxy Z Fold 7's 12.1mm thickness. Meanwhile, the new version weighs only 215 grams, and that's less than every big flagship from Apple, Google, and Samsung.</p><p>Hardware upgrades are a mixed bag. The new model has the advantage of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip</a> and a 200MP camera, but the Galaxy Z Fold 6's comparable offerings are no slouch. You probably won't notice that big of a difference in performance during daily use. Plus, the amount of RAM, battery capacity, and charging speed is completely unchanged between models.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 half-opened with the display on.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it would be nice to have the thinner and lighter Galaxy Z Fold 7, most Galaxy Z Fold 6 users should probably stick with the phone they have for another year.

It was tough to go from Galaxy S25 Edge to a thicker device, and I absolutely noticed a difference holding the Galaxy Z Fold 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>Still, we're talking about $2,000 here. Unless you have boatloads of cash, there just isn't enough to justify the upgrade from the prior model.

Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, which is only two years old, is starting to show its age. It has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip that wasn't built for the AI era, and a 6.2-inch cover screen that isn't wide enough by 2025 standards. Additionally, the phone's 252-gram weight and 13.4mm thickness when folded is pretty chunky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5">compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><p>There are positives to sticking with the Galaxy Z Fold 5, as it has the same battery capacity, charging speed, and secondary cameras as the newer Galaxy Z Fold 7.

These Galaxy foldables had the older wedge-shaped hinge with a gap between the two halves of the phone. This not only made the foldables thicker but also less durable. Samsung's hinge design and build quality have vastly improved since this generation of foldables, and there are many reasons to upgrade.</p><p>For those with a Galaxy Z Fold 5 or a Galaxy Z Fold 4, an upgrade to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 makes a lot of sense. Samsung is offering $900 of trade-in credit for the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and $800 for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 toward the newer model, which is excellent. It means your device will have retained about half of its value even after two or three years of use. If you like the Galaxy Z Fold form factor and have no regrets, I'd jump on this Galaxy Z Fold 7 pre-order offer now before your phone loses value.</p><h2 id="should-you-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-from-a-pixel-fold-pixel-9-pro-fold-or-oneplus-open-2">Should you upgrade to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 from a Pixel Fold, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, or OnePlus Open?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on fence railing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anyone with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a>, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, or OnePlus Open should probably take a pause before jumping toward the new Galaxy Z Fold 7. For starters, switching from phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and OnePlus Open to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is more like a lateral move. Many of Samsung's new additions, like a wider cover screen and thin form factor, have been staples of Google and OnePlus foldables.</p><p>For example, while the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the thinnest foldable available in the U.S., the Pixel 9 Pro Fold measures 10.5mm when folded, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/you-should-love-the-oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a> measures 11.7mm when folded. Both of those are still thinner than the Galaxy Z Fold 6. So, even though Samsung's changes are impressive, they seem better because of how far behind Galaxy Z Fold models already were.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VkZ6nwWXb3q7SN5ammb5v3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-13" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 in Tent Mode hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VkZ6nwWXb3q7SN5ammb5v3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As such, if you're an owner of a Google or OnePlus foldable, I'd recommend waiting to see what the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> holds.

For owners of the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, OnePlus Open, or even an Honor or Oppo foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 isn't going to feel as impactful of an upgrade.</p><p>To figure out whether you need to upgrade, think about the ways your current phone isn't cutting it. Evaluate whether the Galaxy Z Fold 7's upgrades — a thinner and lighter design, bigger main and cover screens, and a 200MP camera sensor — will address those concerns. Finally, decide whether you can afford to spend $2,000 to fix your current device's shortcomings.</p><p>Remember that you can walk into your nearest Best Buy store to try out the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 for yourself — that's how I got my hands on it before release day.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c749f321-4c35-402e-a736-8ded4d096094">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A worthy upgrade</strong></em></p><p>If you have an older Fold or are trying one out for the first time, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the best foldable we've seen come to the U.S. However, anyone with a recent big-screen foldable might find it hard to justify the $2,000 price tag. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-67">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>In a brief video, Anbernic announced its latest gaming handheld, the RG477M.</li><li>This marks the first Anbernic handheld with a metal shell to be released since the RG405M in 2023.</li><li>Other details are scarce, but there's a good chance it features similar specs to the RG557.</li></ul><p>In the time that Anbernic last launched a handheld with a metal shell, the company has released 22 different retro and Android gaming handhelds. That streak will soon be broken, as the RG477M was announced in a 21-second video published to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@anbernic">Anbernic's YouTube channel</a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RBArKfpkZE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The company didn't provide any further details besides showing off some quick B-roll footage. This confirmed the metal shell along with the button, joystick, and D-pad placement. And although it wasn't mentioned, it's safe to assume that the joysticks will have RGB lighting, based on the close-up shots in the video.</p><p>However, based on Anbernic's history, there are a few gaps we can try to fill just from the name. With only a couple of exceptions, the majority of Anbernic handhelds carry a naming scheme of "RGXXYZZ," and are broken down as such:</p><ul><li><strong>XX -</strong> Screen Size</li><li><strong>Y - </strong>Processor</li><li><strong>ZZ -</strong> Version</li></ul><p>So, looking at the RG477M, Anbernic's next handheld will feature a 4.7-inch screen. The "7" likely denotes a more powerful chip, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gemini-notebooklm-gaming-guide-creation">RG557</a>, making use of the MediaTek Dimensity 8300. And the "M" simply denotes that it will feature a metal shell.</p><p>Provided that Anbernic doesn't throw a curveball, it's pretty safe to assume that the RG477M will feature similar internals to those of the RG557. In addition to the Dimensity 8300, the RG557 includes 12GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="nVK46NxPnCeAFZm4VY96mb" name="anbernic-rg477m-teaser-video-screengrabs-6" alt="Anbernic RG477M promo banner render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVK46NxPnCeAFZm4VY96mb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="RNffGvaN4E7ZKVHPcJGAkb" name="anbernic-rg477m-teaser-video-screengrabs-4" alt="Anbernic RG477M bronze shell - angled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RNffGvaN4E7ZKVHPcJGAkb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="QbCNu6FgSCu7rwZTfBeajb" name="anbernic-rg477m-teaser-video-screengrabs-5" alt="Anbernic RG477M silver/gunmetal close-up on left joystick" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QbCNu6FgSCu7rwZTfBeajb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One interesting tidbit to note is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/products/rgslide">Anbernic RG Slide</a> from June features a 4.7-inch IPS display, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1280x960 resolution. It wouldn't come as any surprise if Anbernic ended up using the same panel from the RG Slide in the forthcoming RG477M.</p><p>That being said, we probably won't have to wait very long to learn more about what Anbernic has been working on. Once the initial teaser video is released, the company usually trickles out more information on a semi-rapid pace, leading up to pre-orders being made available. Given that retro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a> with metal shells don't come around very often, I'll be keeping a close eye on the launch of the RG477M.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-72">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>A tipster digging through Google's Android Canary build discovered an alleged early look at its rumored "Gemini Spaces" feature.</li><li>The feature, which seems like a complete At a Glance rework, lets Gemini surface seemingly real-time data on sports and leverage your calendar events.</li><li>Gemini Spaces was reportedly discovered back in June; however, that code leak only suggested its basic functions, like At a Glance-like features, finance, and sports data.</li></ul><p>More information regarding Google's supposed Gemini variant of At a Glance has reportedly come to light.</p><p>Well-known tipster AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-gemini-space-first-look-apk-teardown-3577101/">Android Authority</a>) dug into Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-canary-release-channel-devs-rigorous-testing-pixels">Android Canary release build</a> and reportedly found more on "Gemini Spaces." Diving in supposedly provided the tipster with Google's early design of the feature. Reminiscent of At a Glance, Gemini Spaces will seemingly appear as a widget users can place on their home and lock screens.</p><p>Regarding the latter, the Gemini Spaces card will appear above your Pixel's lock screen clock if the larger numbers are used. If the smaller clock is chosen, the cards will appear right beneath it. The cards on the home screen seem relatively the same; however, the tipster offered a look at its Sports and Calendar event (birthday), which delivered a transparent background for the latter.</p><p>Another important detail is the dots right beneath Gemini Spaces cards.</p><p>These dots seem to indicate users can swipe through whatever Gemini has procured for the user. AssembleDebug was able to swipe from some sports scores to the calendar event, and it looks like there's room for more (if only Google had it working). The tipster adds that these cards should display finance information alongside what was already working early on. Considering Gemini's involvement, it's likely we'll see a whole host of topics/genres available in its new "Spaces" cards.</p><h2 id="gemini-becomes-integral-2">Gemini becomes integral</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:265px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:226.42%;"><img id="SZUbz5m4VKo44PMkJrU3NJ" name="google-gemini-spaces-at-a-glance-lock-screen-leak" alt="A leaked screenshot of Google's "Gemini Spaces" redesign for At a Glance showing a birthday calendar event." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SZUbz5m4VKo44PMkJrU3NJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="265" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="SDf8W3Hdgk5PjVuZLZzFNJ" name="google-gemini-spaces-at-a-glance-home-screen-leak" alt="A screenshot leak of a Pixel's home screen, showing sports scores, courtesy of Google's rumored "Gemini Spaces" feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SDf8W3Hdgk5PjVuZLZzFNJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="266" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>In June, Google's development of "Gemini Spaces" was reported. Those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-give-at-a-glance-a-gemini-makeover-with-extra-smarts">early reports</a> claim the feature was similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Samsung's Now Bar</a>, a feature that delivers real-time information on whatever your interests are. It was originally reported to be a feature for your lock screen, but as we've now seen, it seems Google plans for this to be a true Gemini-fueled successor to At a Glance for your home screen, too.</p><p>The initial report was mostly code; however, that early code showed Gemini Spaces is aiming to "go beyond" what At a Glance can currently do: weather and calendar events. Only finance information and sports scores have been alleged, but it's not hard to imagine what else Gemini can pull for us. Perhaps sales on products we like or quick news blurbs.</p><p>What's more interesting is how much of Android Gemini is moving into. The AI has truly become a part of Google's vision <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-exec-android-gemini-future-os-interview-report">about the future of Android</a>, according to its president of Android Ecosystem, Sameer Samat. Not only is Google planning to merge ChromeOS with Android, but Gemini is taking center stage. Per Samat, Gemini has turned Android into a "helpful experience," which the company undoubtedly plans to evolve.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the app can already "assemble high-quality sources" for users researching hard topics, Google states this update will make things even easier. For this, the post states two new partners, the Atlantic and the Economist, have helped to create public notebooks, such as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/750a23df-fd98-4954-b9c4-71f16c3ee937">How to Build a Life</a>" (Advice) and the analysis journal, "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/5881d15d-7b82-4002-8613-df59b6eece4c">The World Ahead 2025</a>," respectively.</p><p>Soon, when opening NotebookLM, users should notice a "featured notebooks" button beside "My notebooks" on its main page.</p><p>Google will produce several cards of its available featured notebooks with thumbnails, the number of sources, and their titles. These featured notebooks already have everything you'd need available, as well as the option to generate an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overview</a>. These topics, such as the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/19bde485-a9c1-4809-8884-e872b2b67b44">Complete Works of William Shakespeare</a>," have a mind map available to see how things connect.</p><p>Users retain the option to pose questions to the AI to get a little more understanding. However, if you're more interested in reading, you can certainly do that. Gemini's AI summary will be located at the top of those lengthy texts, just in case, too. NotebookLM's "featured notebooks" are rolling out today (July 14) for desktop computers.</p><h2 id="notebooklm-helps-streamline-learning-2">NotebookLM helps streamline learning</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUUZlcUgEis" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Users will also find these publicly available notebooks, courtesy of this new feature:</p><ul><li>Longevity advice from Eric Topol</li><li>A science fan’s guide to visiting Yellowstone National Park</li><li>An overview of long-term trends in human wellbeing, published by the University of Oxford-affiliated project, Our World In Data</li><li>Science-backed parenting advice from psychology professor Jacqueline Nesi</li><li>A notebook tracking the Q1 earnings reports from the top 50 public companies worldwide</li></ul><p>The feature currently rolling out for NotebookLM feels like an extension of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/public-notebooks-are-coming-to-notebooklm-for-easy-sharing-and-studying">Public Notebooks</a>, which debuted in June. Kind of like sharing a Google Doc, users can compile their latest notebook in the app and share a link with other users, so they can see and interact with it, too. Considering NotebookL:M is about studying and learning about topics in a way that doesn't feel so heavy, teachers and other educators may find this useful.</p><p>Topics that you need to teach or learn about take center stage without all the other fluff that doesn't matter. Moreover, your sources are clear, and if you need to scour the internet for them, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">NotebookLM would take care of it</a>.</p><p>Google rolled out Discover Sources in the app this spring, which takes away the necessity for users to search around manually for important sources. Now, users need only describe their topic and let NotebookLM look around and add in what's important. The AI will display what it found, leaving it in the user's hands to go through and check off which ones they want and don't want.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Latest leaks claim the S25 FE will hop over the base S25 in terms of charging, just like last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-vs-galaxy-s23-fe">S24 FE</a>, which only had 25W.</p><p>Early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">rumors from April</a> alleged Samsung was creating a Galaxy Tab S10 "Lite," which is seemingly an even more toned-down variant, under its FE line. While it might also see two-year-old Samsung tech—the Exynos 1380 SoC—a report claimed the company had started testing it with One UI 7. It suggests the device has "progressed" in its development cycle, as rumors purport a fall launch alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-battery-specifications-leak">main Galaxy Tab S11 lineup</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The goal was simple: build a website using Gemini detailing the history of Android.</p><p>Since then, we've been a little busy around these parts, so the project was slightly delayed. I was determined to come up with a (mostly) final result, but wasn't really a fan of the site design that I shared before.</p><p>As a result, I basically started over, firing up Google AI Studio and using a combination of prompts and my own knowledge to reach the goal. So, without further ado, I introduce you to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://androidrewind.com/">AndroidRewind.com</a>.</p><h2 id="android-rewind-2">Android Rewind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NFjPeACJRmYqqz2RQsoe6c" name="android-rewind-home-page-screenshot" alt="Android Rewind home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NFjPeACJRmYqqz2RQsoe6c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3896" height="2191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Funnily enough, Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand recently published his own "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-evolution-of-android-decades-of-transformation">ode to Android</a>," providing snapshots of history since Google acquired Android Inc. back in July 2005. I implore you to check that out before anything else, as you'll get a Jerry-infused history lesson, and there's really nothing better than that.</p><p>As for Android Rewind, I wanted to provide digestible snippets about Android over the years. So you'll find the following landing pages:</p><ul><li><strong>Releases - A timeline of every major version of Android:</strong> Each entry shows the Codename, Release month/year, and Key Features.</li><li><strong>Devices - The hardware that defined generations of Android: </strong>Clicking a device will pull up the full name, OEM, release month/year, and a brief description.</li><li><strong>OEMs - The companies that build the hardware for the Android ecosystem: </strong>Select a company to view the name, primary location, and a bit about each company's impact.</li><li><strong>Notable Figures - The architects and visionaries behind Android: </strong>This one's pretty self-explanatory.</li></ul><p>Initially, the home page was nothing more than the header and a block of text at the top, along with the boxes at the bottom. But that was a bit too bland and boring for my taste, so I prompted Gemini to add a background image to the header section. More importantly, there's also the "Recent Release History," which is just an overview of the last five Android versions.</p><p>Almost all of the images you see on the site were sourced from the Android Central archives. With the exceptions being on the Figures page and images for the very early days of Android releases. Oh, right, and the actual website logo, which I asked Gemini to create and then tweaked to get what you see.</p><h2 id="lean-on-gemini-or-do-it-yourself-2">Lean on Gemini, or do it yourself</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3924px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3bAgZVNZbZgEcydFETvw2c" name="android-rewind-code-assistant-file-tree-preview" alt="Code Assistant with Files and Preview in Google AI Studio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3bAgZVNZbZgEcydFETvw2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3924" height="2208" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since basically this entire website is built using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, that means there's no "backend" or CMS for me to interact with. So after I managed to get most of the pieces in place, I realized I needed a way to edit the content on the page.</p><p>Following the path of least resistance, I just asked Gemini to make certain elements editable. Then, I realized that all I really needed to do was edit the website code myself.</p><p>That kind of speaks to the versatility of working with Gemini, at least from the confines of Google AI Studio. Basically, if you want or need Gemini to do the legwork for you, it's right there. But if you want to take a more hands-on approach, that's also at your disposal.</p><h2 id="a-few-headaches-2">A few headaches</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3931px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cfbkpJWrGtmwQgamaBcr2c" name="android-rewind-google-cloud-deployment-revisions" alt="Android Rewind Google Cloud Deployment History" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cfbkpJWrGtmwQgamaBcr2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3931" height="2211" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Gemini made all of this possible, not everything about building Android Rewind was smooth sailing. The most frustrating aspect was when I wanted to revisit the project at a later time, in order to make changes before the final push.</p><p>It turns out that even after connecting the created app to Google Cloud Run for deployment, there are a couple of ways that I lost progress. The first was actually clicking the "Deploy" button, which results in a pop-up that says the project was "successfully deployed to Google Cloud."</p><p>This is technically true, but it turns out that you have to click the "Redeploy app" if you make any changes to the code. There were a few times in the beginning when I would make changes and hit deploy, thinking that what appeared in the Preview window would be what showed up on the deployed site. That wasn't the case, so I ended up losing a few hours' worth of changes and manual tweaks.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="feePwDWyFAMZLb6avr5Cvb" name="android-rewind-google-cloud-project-deployment-message" alt="Android Rewind Google Cloud Project Deployment from AI Studio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/feePwDWyFAMZLb6avr5Cvb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other frustration I ran into is trying to edit the code after it's been deployed. One might think that you would be able to just come back to the same project in AI Studio later and pick up right where you left off.</p><p>Unless there's something I'm missing, that's not the case. So I had to dig through the Google Cloud Console to find the site code. After downloading the ZIP file, I opened up the initial project in AI Studio, then copied and pasted all of the contents into the specific files, and created new ones where necessary.</p><p>This is something that both Claude and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-havent-used-chatgpt-since-2023-heres-why-gemini-is-all-the-ai-i-need">ChatGPT</a> excel at, as I can close a window and pick right back up where I left off by selecting the pertinent "conversation." Hell, I can even upload an entire ZIP file to either of those and have it make edits for me, while AI Studio only lets me upload individual files and not entire projects.</p><h2 id="looking-to-the-future-2">Looking to the future</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3884px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="AzMrjDtjwDZEaJPxcSvD3c" name="android-rewind-android-release-details" alt="Android Rewind Release window" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AzMrjDtjwDZEaJPxcSvD3c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3884" height="2184" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm pretty happy with the current state of Android Rewind, at least for now. I'm sure that others will tell me about things that are missing, but I'm also going to eventually add more information where it makes sense.</p><p>First, I will add more details to each Android Release and Device entry. I've also toyed around with the idea of having dedicated OEM pages, providing a list of every major device release. Admittedly, I did think about having a full device history, but then I remembered just how many devices Samsung releases any given year, which quickly changed my mind.</p><p>More importantly, I will soon be adding devices like tablets, wearables, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> to the mix. These are all just as important to the history of Android as phones, but for the sake of getting the site launched, I decided to omit them for now.</p><p>Be sure to keep an eye on Android Rewind, as the changes will (hopefully) come swiftly, and with Gemini at my side.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It builds on the original Balance with new features, including HYROX training, scuba support, and a brighter sapphire-glass display. Battery life remains a highlight, easily lasting up to two weeks in everyday use. While it's heavier than past models, it still looks sharp enough to wear all day.</p><p>The Amazfit Balance 2 pushes even closer to Wear OS territory, offering features such as Bluetooth calling through its built-in speaker and microphone. It also supports smart replies with a full QWERTY keyboard, making it easier to respond on the go. You'll find a solid mix of built-in apps, NFC for payments via Zepp Pay. The large 1.5-inch AMOLED display is bright enough for Outdoor use, and the upgraded sapphire glass and aluminum frame give the watch a premium, durable feel.</p><p>That said, the Balance 2 isn't without its drawbacks. Zepp OS also lacks the flexibility and app ecosystem of Wear OS, and message replies, while supported, can occasionally lag or fail to send. With no LTE option, you'll need to stay connected to your phone for full functionality.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-value"><span>Best value</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2361px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zupyfmcha2XvpCfLogXuVC" name="Amazfit-bip-6-lifestyle" alt="Amazfit Bip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zupyfmcha2XvpCfLogXuVC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2361" height="1328" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazfit)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-amazfit-bip-6-2"><span class="title__text">2.

It keeps the familiar rectangular design that many users love, but upgrades the experience with a larger, sharper 1.97-inch AMOLED display. The lightweight aluminum frame strikes a good balance between style and durability, and at 27.9 grams without the strap, it's comfortable enough for all-day use. You can choose from a range of colors, including black, charcoal, stone, and red.</p><p>The 14-day battery life is comparable to that of some of the more expensive Amazfit watches on this list, which is impressive. When you compare that to competitors that last for a day or two, this is a great accomplishment. The Amazfit Bip 6 offers over 140 sports modes, including popular options like outdoor running, strength training, and cycling. You'll also find more specialized activities, such as HYROX racing, yoga, and high-intensity interval training, providing fitness enthusiasts with a wide range of options.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-under-100"><span>Best under $100</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2587px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="keaEodb2MAR2ugvAA5t9YE" name="Amazfit-active-2" alt="Amazfit Active 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/keaEodb2MAR2ugvAA5t9YE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2587" height="1455" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazfit)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-amazfit-active-2-2"><span class="title__text">3.

The polycarbonate watch body is available in two unique colors: Desert Black and Sahara. The 1.3-inch AMOLED display has a touchscreen for easy navigation and four side buttons that you can use to navigate the watch if that's your preferred method. The best thing about this design is that it's tough and ideal for outdoor enthusiasts since it has military-grade durability. The Amazfit T-Rex Ultra is easily one of the toughest watches, as it has passed 15 military-grade tests instead of 12 on the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-t-rex-review">Amazfit T-Rex</a>.</p><p>No matter how long you plan to be outdoors, this is also one of the best Amazfit smartwatches for extended battery life. You can expect this beast to last up to 20 days with typical use. Those who use their smartwatch heavily can expect an average of around 12 days. In continuous GPS mode, the battery will last for 28 hours, and you can get as much as 80 hours from the endurance GPS mode. You also get an incredible water resistance rating. The Amazfit T-Rex Ultra can handle a depth of up to 100 meters, also known as 10 ATM water resistance.</p><p>Speaking of tracking, most users will be happy with the Amazfit T-Rex Ultra's health and activity features. You'll have over 160 sports modes, including outdoor cycling, treadmill, trail running, and walking. You can also record specific activities like hiking, climbing, hunting, and more. During a workout, you can also track your route with the built-in advanced GPS.

This model offers better GPS features than most smartwatches, with the GPS antenna able to pick up 100% of satellite signals instead of the 50% that most watches can manage. As a result, the Cheetah Pro will let you track your route far more accurately than other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running smartwatches</a> on the market.</p><p>Its slew of features includes 24-hour monitoring of various metrics and multiple triathlete modes. These features make it well worth the price tag, along with over 100 apps and multiple face options to tailor the watch to suit your needs.</p><p>There are arguably <em>too</em> many features here, though, with hidden menus and an overwhelming number of options that don't work as well as they should. This suggests that Amazfit could have benefitted from a little more streamlining rather than going the route of "jack of all trades, master of none."</p><p>However, while running, the watch comes into its own, boasting an impressive 14-hour battery life and a super lightweight design. The price tag is competitive, too, with the number of features justifying a purchase for serious runners.</p><p>The touchscreen is bright and impressive, but it is a little inconsistent during use. Overall, though, the Cheetah Pro is impressive, but it is a little more niche than other offerings on this list. If you are into running, though, this is definitely the watch for you.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-battery"><span>Best battery</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="S9ZHSccc36QHj6CCdA4RoV" name="Amazfit Balance" alt="Amazfit Balance smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S9ZHSccc36QHj6CCdA4RoV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="6-amazfit-balance-2"><span class="title__text">6.

As with any smartwatch, you first ask yourself why you're getting it. Is it to keep track of steps, specific sports or activities, or get a good handle on your overall health and wellness? Then consider what else you want to do with it. Do you need access to third-party apps? Would you like to load music directly onto your watch? Do you want to read notifications and answer calls or texts directly from your wrist?</p><p>Create a list of features you want the watch to have, as well as the ones you need. Then, run through this list and eliminate or highlight models one by one. Soon, you'll be left with one or two models to choose from. From there, it might come down to price and design: Which one fits better on your wrist, suits your lifestyle, and is more affordable for your pocketbook?</p><p>The good news is that Amazfit has a smartwatch for just about everybody. When you focus on fitness, fashion, or both, you can find a model with everything you need. However, if you're looking for the absolute best Amazfit smartwatch, we highly recommend the Balance. It features a sleek design with fitness tracking capabilities, ensuring exceptional battery life.</p><p>To recap, the Amazfit Balance is equipped with over 150 sport modes, built-in GPS, sleep tracking, heart-rate monitoring, blood oxygen tracking, Amazon Alexa integration, and a microphone and speaker, allowing you to answer calls. It's not the type of watch that you'll have to charge every night, either. With average use, you might only need to charge it once a week.</p><p>Regardless of your preferences, you can likely find an Amazfit smartwatch that meets them. Whether you're a professional athlete looking to track your workouts and improve endurance, a runner training for the next big 5K, or a first-time user just getting started in the smartwatch world, there's bound to be a fitness-focused wearable from Amazfit that's perfect for you.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-we-test"><span>How we test</span></h3><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Why you can trust Android Central</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">☑️ One of the <strong>oldest and most trusted</strong> Android sites on the web<br>☑️ Over <strong>15 years</strong> of product testing<br>☑️ <strong>Thousands </strong>of products reviewed and tested since 2007<br>☑️ <strong>Dozens </strong>of smartwatches tested every year by our team</p></div></div><p>Testing smartwatches at Android Central involves much more than strapping them to our arms and taking a few pictures. Android Central Senior Editor Michael Hicks runs a weekly column called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/sunday-runday">Sunday Runday</a>, where he discusses how smartwatches and exercise can help improve your life and promote health. Other smartwatch reviewers on the team, like Managing Editor Derrek Lee and Senior Editor Nicholas Sutrich, take numerous watches to the gym and competitions, putting them to the test exactly as you might.</p><p>In addition to comparing various watches during workouts, we wear each one to bed to evaluate sleep tracking and take them on long walks to test step accuracy. These everyday routines help us judge comfort, durability, and battery life over time. Therefore, when we recommend a smartwatch, it's because we've thoroughly tested it in real-world conditions and have the data to back it up.</p><p>Then there's the watch's operating system itself. Like Amazfit's smartwatches, many watches use proprietary operating systems that are compatible with Android and iOS devices. However, that can sometimes mean they aren't as full-featured as the OS made by Apple or Google. We take these things into account and ensure that you understand what might be missing from the experience on these watches, because, often, they excel in areas where watches from Google or Apple fall short.</p><p>Of course, all this affects how long a smartwatch's battery lasts. More features can sometimes mean worse battery life, but watches from brands like Amazfit or Garmin aim to help you stay healthier without requiring daily battery charging. We wear our watches for weeks or months to ensure accurate data and testing, so you can expect our battery life estimates to be exact.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Both the inner and outer displays are AMOLED with 120Hz refresh rates, and the FlexWindow also utilizes Samsung's Vision Booster technology so you can use the screen in any light. </p><p>Things are just as impressive under the hood, as the Galaxy Z Flip 7 boasts the powerful Exynos 2500 processor with all of the latest Galaxy AI-boosted software features. The phone also features seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed, and the 4,300mAh battery is the largest ever used in a Z Flip device.</p><p>The only problem is that the $1,099.99 price tag may put the Z Flip 7 out of reach for some folks, which is all the more reason why the T-Mobile deal above is so, so sweet. </p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-z-flip-7-quick-links-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 / Z Flip 7 quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hands-on: a new hope</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Samsung Unpacked 2025: your ultimate guide</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-deals">Galaxy Z Flip 7 preorder deals</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-deals">Galaxy Z Fold 7 preorder deals</a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The teardown of the HeyMelody <strong>v115.8</strong> version has revealed new code referencing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-use-spotify-tap-samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro">Spotify Tap</a>.</p><p>For the unaware, Spotify Tap is a feature that lets users start playing tracks with a double tap or triple tap on compatible earbuds without the need to unlock the phone or open the Spotify app. The feature is already a prominent one on audio products made by Bose, Jabra, Sony, and Marshall or some Samsung Galaxy Buds, for that matter.

However, going by the recent rumors of Samsung replacing the Plus model in favor of the Edge phone, the NPA2 is likely an indication of the next iteration of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.</p><p>And according to the supposed database, either of the handsets is likely to feature an ultra-wide angle lens featuring a 50MP lens. If it turns out to be accurate, it marks a significant upgrade over the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> and S25 Edge handsets.</p><p>Lastly, there isn't any notable information regarding the NPA1 model, which is likely the regular Galaxy S26 model. Since these are just specs based on the internal codenames and databases, things are likely to change when the devices launch officially sometime early next year, which is at least six months from now. So, consider the latest developments with a grain of salt.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Even though there was an "end of 2025" deadline, Samsung hasn't shared much about how things go forward, even in any of the recent Unpacked events held this year.</p><p>What this means is that the Galaxy AI features comprising Live Translate, Note Assist in Samsung Notes, Zoom Nightography, Audio Eraser, Browsing Assist, Generative Wallpapers, and several others that come by default on Galaxy phones, like the Galaxy S25 series, for instance, will remain free, which sounds promising.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dCRgAQhcjbG28XCcx6NSw3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-10" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Google Gemini hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCRgAQhcjbG28XCcx6NSw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, Google provides advanced features with paywalls like Gemini AI Pro and Ultra subscriptions.

Google has announced that both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> would get access to the Google AI Pro subscription for six months at zero cost.

HMD Global, the company behind Nokia-branded smartphones, is shifting its focus away from the U.S. market, leaving fans wondering what this means for the future of the Nokia brand.</p><p>HMD Global told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/705046/hmd-global-nokia-scaling-back-us-market" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that it is scaling back its presence in the U.S., which could mean no new Nokia phones will be launching stateside anytime soon. The company reiterated that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-global/hmd-global-barbie-phone">existing devices will still get support</a>, meaning security updates and warranties will continue as promised.</p><p>The company is calling it “scaling back,” but it looks more like it's fully stepping away from selling phones in the U.S. It’s a quiet exit from a market HMD never quite managed to crack.</p><p>As it stands, all buy buttons are gone from HMD's product pages. You might still spot a few Nokia phones on places like Amazon, but those are probably just leftover inventories, and once they're gone, that’s likely it.</p><h2 id="tariffs-took-a-toll-2">Tariffs took a toll</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="ghtTu477BqoshoXmRuGhUa" name="Nokia-C1-Plus-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Nokia C1 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ghtTu477BqoshoXmRuGhUa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1535" height="863" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nokia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>HMD blames its U.S. retreat on geopolitical and economic challenges, which is basically a polite way of saying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/trumps-tariff-threat-now-targets-samsung-and-your-favorite-smartphones">U.S. tariffs made things too expensive to be worth it</a>. Higher costs, thinner profits, and the market just wasn’t working in its favor.</p><p>The U.S. smartphone market is a tough battleground, dominated by big players like Apple and Samsung. HMD struggled to gain traction with carriers and consumers, despite Nokia’s nostalgic appeal. Meanwhile, the company may be refocusing on markets where budget and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phones</a> sell better.</p><p>Last year, it began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nokia-no-more-hmd-global-shifts-gears">moving away from the Nokia brand</a> to focus on creating original devices and building new partnerships.</p><p>To be clear, HMD is not closing shop. Right now, it is focused on making sure the exit doesn’t leave customers or partners hanging. Warranties, support, and service are still on the table, backed by its global teams.</p><p>HMD took over Nokia’s feature phone business from Microsoft back in 2016, after Microsoft had its own go at reviving the brand in 2014. At the same time, HMD scored a deal to use the Nokia name on budget and mid-range phones and tablets. That licensing deal runs until March 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But <em>should</em> you upgrade to the Galaxy Watch 8, or should you hold off for the Galaxy Watch 9?</p><p>As the person who reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 and 6 Classic</a>, owns the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, reviewed the first-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, and is currently testing the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, I feel more than qualified to answer the question!</p><p>I'll talk about the polarizing Ultra-fication of the Watch 8 lineup, something my colleague Andrew discussed in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 8 hands-on</a>. But whatever your tastes, upgraded specs and new Samsung Health features should matter just as much as design.</p><p>Here's the gist, if you're in a hurry: Galaxy Watch 7 owners have only one tentative reason to upgrade, but with a Galaxy Watch 6 (Classic) or older, you should be seriously tempted.</p><h2 id="the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-isn-t-as-different-as-it-looks-2">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 isn't as different as it looks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="e2XQUEGeVYWuj3GdMkZRJG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2XQUEGeVYWuj3GdMkZRJG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 8 vs. 7</a>, it's immediately apparent how similar they are. They share the 3nm Exynos W1000 chip, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, dual-band GPS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity standards, and the latest BioActive Sensor suite with extra HR LEDs.</p><p>If you're switching from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Watch 6 to the Watch 8</a>, however, you do get a faster, more battery-efficient processor, dual-band GPS, more accurate health sensors with more data, faster charging, and doubled storage. Slightly more tempting, right?</p><p>Samsung slightly switched up its display sizes with the Watch 8: It measures 1.34 and 1.47 inches instead of 1.3 and 1.5, with a 326 pixels-per-inch ratio that's right in the usual ballpark. I doubt most people will notice that the display is different from previous years, aside from the extra brightness.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-11" alt="The Galaxy Watch 8 (left) and Watch 8 Classic (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch 8 (<em>left</em>) and Watch 8 Classic (<em>right</em>) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 is 1.1mm skinnier than the Watch 7, or 2mm thinner than the Watch 8 Classic. So even if it looks thick in photos, it's the opposite because Samsung redesigned its internals to shrink things down.</p><p>The photos above and below show what the Galaxy Watch 8 looks like in person. Active-style Galaxy Watches have cases that hug the display edge so it feels like one seamless package; now, the bezelless display looks more isolated and elevated, and the squircle aluminum case stands out more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pryAeGXhZDXVRmSfCcJUXG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pryAeGXhZDXVRmSfCcJUXG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Personally, I've always found Galaxy Watches to be comfortable and functional, but fairly boring and far from a "normal" watch look. So I don't mind the Galaxy Watch 8 design experiment, because it switches things up after years of monotonous repetition.</p><p>Both the Watch 8 and 7 look artificial; the newer model just leans into this a bit more. Samsung superfans might dislike it, but since this squircle redesign is probably here to stay, you may want to try it out and see if you like it in person.</p><p>My colleague Andrew prefers the Watch 8 Classic look more and doesn't mind heavier watches, but he admitted that the Watch 8 is light enough to "forget" you're wearing it. With the default band attached, the Watch 8 40mm and 44mm will only weigh about 52–56g, very reasonable and comfortable for a smartwatch.</p><h2 id="no-other-smartwatch-looks-like-the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-except-the-ultra-2">No other smartwatch looks like the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (except the Ultra)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dWtbcgRrNYoq22gE4hH4vZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-close-up" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in a top-down view." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dWtbcgRrNYoq22gE4hH4vZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Galaxy Watch 6 Classic owners may feel conflicted about the Watch 8 Classic look, because the Ultra chic runs directly counter to the idea of a "classic" smartwatch design. But if you're strictly buying for the rotating bezel paired with two generations of upgrades, the Watch 8 Classic fits the bill nicely.</p><p>Where the Watch 8 display looks naked above the square-ish case, the Watch 8 Classic fills that gap with the zero-to-sixty scale border and the rotating bezel. From your top-down perspective wearing it, the Watch 8 Classic looks stylish and doesn't seem "unnatural."</p><p>To others, however, its flat sides may look bulky, calling attention to the fact that it's a smartwatch.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-display" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the default watch face, display border, and rotating bezel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2766" height="1556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="m5SWPtuvZkHymD45EFs36a" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-quick-button" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic sitting on top of an ornamental gold bowl, the right side with three buttons showing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m5SWPtuvZkHymD45EFs36a.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PWL6aEAvifsKmW9YPQfxzZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-side-view" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on the left side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWL6aEAvifsKmW9YPQfxzZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>You may be rightly concerned that the extra steel casing makes the Watch 8 Classic overly heavy. In practice, both my Watch 8 Classic 46mm and Watch 6 Classic 47mm weigh 86g or 3oz. And the newer model is 0.3mm thinner, though you can barely tell the difference in person.</p><p>The bulk <em>does</em> have an impact, because Samsung gave its Watch 8 Classic a smaller 1.34-inch display; there's no 1.5-inch option this time because (presumably) it would be <em>way</em> too heavy. You'll have to accept that visual downgrade, though you get an extra 1,000 nits of brightness, the Quick Button, 64GB of storage, and the other Watch 8 upgrades as consolation.</p><p>It's clear that Samsung made the Classic a more affordable spin-off of the Ultra, without the benefit of an extra day of battery life. It's too heavy for casual smartwatch fans, but those willing to wear a heavier watch might want the Ultra, or a cheaper, long-lasting option like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, long-time Classic fans will have to accept these changes for the rotating bezel, which feels just as seamless and natural to use as it did with the Watch 6 Classic.</p><h2 id="your-watch-8-upgrade-decision-will-come-down-to-samsung-health-2">Your Watch 8 upgrade decision will come down to Samsung Health </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results with Samsung Health on Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 launches with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> running One UI 8 Watch, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/samsung-announces-one-ui-8-watch-beta-program">major new health metrics</a>: carotene levels for your Antioxidant Index, heart health with Vascular Load, personalized training plans with Running Coach, and circadian rhythm for Bedtime Guidance.</p><p>I assumed that because the Watch 8 and 7 share the same health sensor suite, the Watch 7 would track all of this data once it got the update in a few months.

As with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it feels like Samsung has something to prove with the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and its bold yet familiar design shows us that it does listen to consumers… at least somewhat.</p><p>There's certainly a lot to like about the Galaxy Z Flip 7, but there are some big question marks. This includes the move to another chipset despite Samsung's other phones this year using the latest from Qualcomm, as well as Samsung's insistence on not following Motorola's footsteps with regard to exactly how that newly expanded cover screen is handled.</p><p>So, should you buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>?

However, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 still doesn't let you use apps on the cover screen out of the box. As noted by Andrew Myrick in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">hands-on</a>, Samsung still keeps this functionality behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">MultiStar module in Good Lock</a>, meaning users will have to do a bit of extra work to enable this.</p><p>We haven't had a chance to see if there are any improvements to the overall experience, but this already doesn't bode well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Tg6AxfFftiir4PJqXAv866" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-25" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Now Brief hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tg6AxfFftiir4PJqXAv866.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, using apps on the cover screen is very handy, but it's not the be-all end-all of the entire Galaxy Z Flip 7 experience.

The Razr Ultra 2025, for example, doesn't seem to hit awe-inspiring benchmarking numbers compared to other 8 Elite devices, despite the phone performing very well in daily use. The compact Z Flip 7 may not require all that power, and Samsung may be more interested in efficiency than anything else.</p><p>I should note that I don't put much stock in benchmarking and instead rely solely on my experience using devices. The Razr Ultra 2025 can handle just about anything I throw at it, but I can't help but wonder if all that power is why Motorola stuffed a 4,700mAh battery into it. Meanwhile, Samsung seems content with a 4,300mAh battery for the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and given the difference in how these two chips are configured, I imagine Samsung is able to etch out more battery life with less.</p><p>Of course, time will tell how the chip will perform, and you'll have to wait for our review for more details.</p><h2 id="verdict-who-should-buy-this-phone-2">Verdict: Who should buy this phone?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 in Blue Shadow hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 feels like a huge step in the right direction for Samsung. The improved design and larger cover screen make this a much more competitive flip phone, which should make Motorola nervous. That said, the jury is still out on whether the Exynos 2500 will shine or fall flat when compared to the competition.</p><p>The lower price tag is one of the advantages the Galaxy Z Flip 7 has over the Razr Ultra 2025. You can get it in a lower storage configuration than what Motorola offers, saving you about $200. Even at 512GB, it's still cheaper than Motorola's flagship, although that's with less RAM.</p><p>Overall, I think that almost anyone interested in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 should consider buying one, especially if you're coming from anything older than the Galaxy Z Flip 6. If you do have last year's model, you might wanna hold off upgrading, as the differences aren't as drastic.

July 11, 2005, is regarded by many as the official date when the Android team relocated to the Google campus and became part of the Google team.</p><p>Initially, Android Inc. was developing an operating system for digital cameras, but Google quickly pivoted its focus towards the burgeoning smartphone market, recognizing the immense potential. This acquisition laid the foundation for Google's entry into mobile software, setting the stage for a revolution.</p><p>The first commercially available Android device, the HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1), launched in October 2008. At this time, smartphones were still a niche, dominated by BlackBerry. Early Android phones were characterized by physical keyboards, small resistive touchscreens (typically around 3.2 inches), and a focus on basic internet browsing, email, and communication. Consumer needs were relatively simple: a reliable device for calls, texts, some basic web access, and a handful of apps.</p><p>Android's open-source nature quickly attracted developers, leading to a rapid expansion of the app ecosystem. By the early 2010s, Android had begun its meteoric rise, with devices like the Motorola Droid and Samsung Galaxy S series pushing touchscreen-only designs and incrementally larger displays (around 4-5 inches), signing the death certificate for physical keyboards.</p><h2 id="growing-pains-2015-2017-refinement-and-the-rise-of-the-big-screen-2">Growing pains (2015-2017): Refinement and the rise of the big screen</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qsuQSb7ouMb2R6KiKUSYFR" name="htc-one-nexus-4-04.jpg" alt="LG Nexus 4 versus HTC One." src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qsuQSb7ouMb2R6KiKUSYFR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>By 2015, Android was a <em>mostly</em> mature and dominant platform, having surpassed its competitors in market share. Devices were becoming sleeker, and screen sizes had settled into a comfortable range, typically between 5 and 5.5 inches. The "phablet" category, once a novelty, was starting to influence mainstream design, with devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-6p-specs">Nexus 6P</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-review">Galaxy Note</a> series pushing the upper limits. Consumer needs at this time revolved around reliable app performance, improved battery life, and access to a rapidly expanding and increasingly sophisticated app ecosystem for communication, social media, entertainment, and basic productivity.</p><p>Android's strength continued to be its open-source nature, fostering diverse hardware options from numerous manufacturers, which in turn catered to a wide range of budgets and preferences.</p><p>This period saw the solidification of core Android features, the refinement of Material Design for a more cohesive user interface, and significant improvements in camera technology. As users consumed more media, played more graphically intensive games, and engaged with more complex apps, the desire for slightly larger and more vibrant viewing areas began to subtly emerge, pushing screen sizes incrementally upwards and setting the stage for the next wave of innovation.</p><h2 id="the-era-of-edge-to-edge-displays-2018-2020-maximizing-screen-real-estate-2">The era of edge-to-edge displays (2018-2020): Maximizing screen real estate</h2><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="F6G2N7CAH334QDScAfamr4" name="google-pixel-3-xl-white-4.jpg" alt="Pixel 3 XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F6G2N7CAH334QDScAfamr4.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The years between 2018 and 2020 marked a pivotal shift towards truly expansive, edge-to-edge screens. Manufacturers, driven by consumer demand for more immersive content consumption and enhanced multitasking capabilities, began to minimize bezels aggressively. Innovations like the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-notch-add-screen-space-or-take-it-away">notch</a>," "punch-hole," and later under-display camera designs became common, pushing displays closer to the very edges of the device.</p><p>Screens grew significantly, with 6-inch and even 6.5-inch displays becoming standard, often in taller, narrower aspect ratios that made them more comfortable to hold despite their increased diagonal size.</p><p>Consumer needs evolved beyond basic functionality.

The larger, more immersive screens facilitated better split-screen multitasking and provided a superior canvas for media, gaming, and productivity apps, cementing the idea that a bigger display offered a more premium and functional experience.</p><p>This period also saw a greater emphasis on software updates, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-important-are-android-security-patches">security patches</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-io-privacy-location-data-collection">privacy controls</a>, as smartphones became increasingly central to users' personal and professional lives.</p><h2 id="the-foldable-frontier-2021-present-a-new-form-factor-2">The foldable frontier (2021-Present): A new form factor</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PTZZY2kKG6QR9StcMURpS7" name="podcast-addict-android-central-podcast-z-fold-3-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Podcast Addict app playing Android Central podcast on a Galaxy Z Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PTZZY2kKG6QR9StcMURpS7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most radical change in Android's recent history has been the introduction and maturation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, beginning around 2019 but gaining significant traction and refinement from 2021 onwards. Devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dont-want-to-spend-usd2k-on-the-fold-7-get-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-for-almost-40-percent-off-instead">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Z Flip</a> series, along with offerings from other manufacturers such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google's Pixel Fold</a>, shattered the traditional smartphone form factor. These devices directly addressed the desire for even larger screen real estate, offering a tablet-sized display when unfolded, while maintaining a pocketable form factor when closed.</p><p>This innovation necessitated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-is-google-getting-serious-about-foldables">significant adaptations within Android itself</a>. Google introduced specific optimizations for large screens, improved app continuity (seamless transitions between folded and unfolded states), and enhanced multitasking features tailored for the expansive inner displays, including better drag-and-drop and multi-window support. Consumer needs now include not just a large screen, but a versatile screen that can adapt to different use cases – from a compact phone to a mini-tablet, and even a laptop-like experience with external accessories.</p><p>Beyond foldables, the trend of large screens continued in traditional slab phones, with premium models routinely sporting displays well over 6.7 inches, often with high refresh rates for smoother scrolling and animations. Privacy and security have also become paramount consumer concerns, leading to more granular permission controls and transparency features within Android.</p><p>The platform continues to evolve, focusing on seamless connectivity, deeper integration with other devices (like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables">wearables</a> and smart home devices), and a more personalized, intelligent user experience, all while pushing the boundaries of hardware innovation with the foldable form factor leading the charge.</p><h2 id="evolving-android-2">Evolving Android</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4146px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iowDZd4ev9eQV6gdinVrbK" name="Android" alt="The Android sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iowDZd4ev9eQV6gdinVrbK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4146" height="2332" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since Google's foresightful acquisition of Android Inc. in 2005, the Android ecosystem has undergone a remarkable and ongoing transformation.

Nowadays, things have mostly calmed down, with Amazon, Apple, Google, and Roku leading the charge. Last year, Google shifted its focus, as it introduced the Google TV Streamer 4K, while also retiring the beloved Chromecast line.</p><p>Now, the Google TV Streamer sits atop the mountain in Google's ecosystem, operating as both a smart home hub and an excellent 4K streaming device. It wasn't really something that I expected to be part of the Prime Day festivities, but as it turns out, it's actually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Streamer-Streaming-Entertainment-Porcelain/dp/B0D8WJYSF9/"><strong>$15 off over at Amazon</strong></a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9645927358031349343-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><em><strong>Prime Day 2025 ends tonight!

Google thankfully rectified that with the TV Streamer, as it includes 32GB of storage. And if that isn't enough, you can connect a USB-C hub and a thumb drive to expand it even further.</p><p>There are also a few AI features on board, but they aren't really intrusive and are more novelty than anything else. However, the biggest reason why I love the TV Streamer is that it can basically turn my TV into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-display">massive smart display</a>.</p><p>Google integrated both Matter and a Thread Border Router into the TV Streamer, ensuring that it would be compatible with just about any smart home ecosystem. Of course, it works best when you use the Google Home app, but if you take the time to set up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/this-one-app-has-made-my-life-so-much-easier">Home Assistant</a>, you can connect and control all of your smart home devices right from the Google Home app.</p><p>I'm not sure what the future holds for the Google TV Streamer, but it's still performing well enough that it's not something I've even thought about.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-7">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4573639154595610853-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1212356707565852129-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9376992827335726461-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1233177422277781313-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4012941798439036658-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide.</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Even though Prime Day ends at midnight on July 11, some deals will persist on competing sites like Best Buy through the weekend, and one cheap (for Garmin) deal that's currently still available is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/garmin-venu-sq-2-gps-smartwatch-40mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-slate-2022/6517040.p?skuId=6517040"><strong>Garmin Venu Sq 2 at $149 ($100 off) at Best Buy</strong></a>.</p><p>We called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review">Garmin Venu Sq 2</a> the "Goldilocks smartwatch" in our original review because of how it struck a nice balance between smarts and fitness. Since then, Garmin watches have gotten smarter, but also more expensive; I'd love to recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-x1-bizarre-premium-watch-stuck-between-two-worlds">Venu X1</a>, but they're just too dang expensive for an impulse buy to try out the brand.</p><p>That's why I'm recommending the Venu Sq 2 as an affordable gateway into the world of Garmin, to see if you can change your lifestyle and become more fit with a little help, while also benefiting from perks like an 11-day battery life, all-systems GNSS tracking, and a 1.4-inch AMOLED display.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1cd4efa2-456e-408e-8eb3-30a2eb870a1d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Garmin Venu Sq 2 still holds up as an intriguing entry-level option to the brand.
