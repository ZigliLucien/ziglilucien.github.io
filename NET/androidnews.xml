Not today. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/phone-plans/12-month-plans/"><strong>Purchase one year of Mint&apos;s Unlimited plan right now and you&apos;ll get 50% off your purchase,</strong></a> knocking the price down to only $180 upfront (or $15 per month).  </p><p>Mint&apos;s Unlimited plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile&apos;s unrivalled 5G network, plus you get a free mobile hotspot and free calls to Mexico, Canada, and the UK. There&apos;s a reason we listed it as one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">best unlimited plans</a> for Android users, and now it&apos;s half off. </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d82427d5-ec0f-4872-9a51-0ec91469d5bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile" data-dimension48="Get 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/phone-plans/12-month-plans/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="cNfSyKCaNDAiPxukdZBSfG" name="mnt mobile square render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cNfSyKCaNDAiPxukdZBSfG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/phone-plans/12-month-plans/" data-dimension112="d82427d5-ec0f-4872-9a51-0ec91469d5bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile" data-dimension48="Get 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile"><strong>Get 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile</strong></a></p><p>While everything else seems to be getting more expensive, <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a> has decided to give you 50% off one year of its popular Unlimited plan, knocking the upfront price down to only $180. </p><p>Just imagine it: 12 months of unlimited T-Mobile-powered wireless for what amounts to $15 per month. Compare that to your current phone bill and tell me it doesn't sound good. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/phone-plans/12-month-plans/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d82427d5-ec0f-4872-9a51-0ec91469d5bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile" data-dimension48="Get 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want Unlimited wireless for dirt cheap; you don&apos;t mind paying for a full year of service in advance.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t want to commit to a year of one wireless plan; you need more perks or you regularly use over 35GB of data in a month. </p><p>Owned and operated by T-Mobile, Mint Mobile is a popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carrier</a> that works by selling its wireless in 3, 6, and 12-month increments of time. Although you have to pay a bit more for the wireless upfront, it generally becomes quite cheap once you break the costs down month to month. This makes Mint a convenient choice for folks who want to drop a chunk of cash and not think about their phone bill again for a while.</p><p>As described above, the Unlimited plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile&apos;s vast 5G network. High-speed data is technically capped at 35GB per month, after which speeds <em>could</em> slow if the network becomes congested. Aside from a free mobile hotspot and a few international benefits, there also aren&apos;t as many perks as you might get from other wireless carriers, but that&apos;s a small price to pay when you consider the value here. </p><p>I&apos;ll put it this way: Mint is a simple, affordable carrier for folks who want simple, affordable wireless. And if you&apos;ve been thinking about switching anyway, this deal presents an outstanding opportunity. </p><h2 id="need-a-new-phone-too-2">Need a new phone too?</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e4f03dbe-b4ed-498c-8893-2a6492d77f69" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:204px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:121.08%;"><img id="Y8nScb7AAtxK4j2d2EnxjV" name="google-pixel-9-render-obsidian.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y8nScb7AAtxK4j2d2EnxjV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="204" height="247" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 9 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" data-dimension112="e4f03dbe-b4ed-498c-8893-2a6492d77f69" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799"><del>$799</del> <strong>$359, plus BOGO year of Unlimited at Mint Mobile</strong></a></p><p>Mint is also home to a ton of great phone deals, such as this offer that slashes over 50% off the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> AND throws in a free year of Unlimited when you bundle the purchase of the phone with one year of service.</p><p>In other words, you're getting a top-rated flagship phone along with two full years of T-Mobile-powered wireless for only $719 (or $30 per month when you pay using affirm). <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e4f03dbe-b4ed-498c-8893-2a6492d77f69" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div><ul><li> <strong>More MVNO deals: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.boostmobile.com/mypromo/trial-mybm"><u><strong>Boost</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans"><u><strong>Tello</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans"><u><strong>Cricket</strong></u></a> </li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The survey runs through the typical checks and balances; however, the publication noticed two important questions, each regarding Qi2 wireless charging and its magnetic hardware.</p><p>Arguably, the most important question is number 38, which says, "Would you prefer to have magnets built into the phone even if it made the phone thicker?" Two of the answers say you wouldn't mind Qi2 magnets within the device, even if it made the phone "within 0.3mm" or "within 0.5mm" larger. These aren't outlandish differences, especially considering Samsung's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">thin phone era</a>, but that tech inside would <em>slightly </em>enlarge things.</p><p>The publication details another option that says you wouldn't want Qi2 magnets inside if it made the phone larger, while the final choice says "magnets must be included," no matter the increase.</p><p>The other question poses an interesting scenario: what if a Galaxy phone <em>only </em>had wireless charging? Samsung asks, "if only wireless charging is supported, would having Qi2 (like MagSafe) reduce any inconveniences?"</p><h2 id="samsung-qi2-2">Samsung & Qi2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87" name="magsafe-ring-adapter-silicone-case-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Silicone Case with MagSafe ring and PopSocket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's recent history with Qi2 on the Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">has been incredibly confusing</a>, but it all boils down to a simple answer. Samsung's latest flagship series is the first set of phones to feature "Qi2 Ready support;" however, these devices don't feature the required magnets within themselves. So, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">yes, the Galaxy S25 series offers wireless charging</a>, thanks to Qi2, but only at 15W.</p><p>If you're interested in grabbing a Qi2 charger, the Galaxy S25 series will be compatible with it. One thing you should note is that, without the magnets, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">you will need a case</a> that brings the necessary built-in magnets for that.</p><p>Perhaps we can speculate that Samsung dropped these magnets to make its series thinner, especially after seeing the recent consumer survey. That's not exactly confirmed, so it's just food for thought. There's also no telling when/if Samsung would even provide built-in magnets for its devices. The Galaxy S26 series comes to mind. We'd only hear something actionable early next year, if it does.</p><p>The company's rumored Galaxy S25 FE was recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-wpc-listing-qi2-info-real-life-image-report">spotted moving through the WPC</a> for wireless charging, to which it received Qi2 (v2.1) certification. However, given speculation that says we might see this phone later this year, we might not see these built-in magnets for this model. If anything, the S25 FE will fit closer to the others with 15W wireless charging and the necessity for a case.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Kang praised the foldables, stating they are "perfect hardware innovations that perfectly complete the first generation of foldables and open up the next generation."</p><p>One of the most substantial changes occurred within the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, which thinned down to 8.9mm (unfolded) and 4.2mm (folded). Kang states this was a product of consumers wanting something "thin and light." However, Samsung understands that not everyone may enjoy its sacrifices: notably, the S Pen. Samsung is reportedly looking into R&D means for new technologies within a future S Pen to make it thinner.</p><p>For now, Kang states consumers should look at the Fold 7 as a "trade-off," adding, "where you lose one if you choose one."</p><p>The publication highlights Kang's additional statement, claiming Samsung won't do anything that sticks until there's a certain level of "perfection." Moreover, "consumer demand" is another major catalyst behind the S Pen's potential return. The post mentions the Fold 7's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-flagship-launch-flip-7-fe">Armor Flex Hinge</a>, which is lighter and thinner than the Fold 6's hinge, further facilitating a slimmer phone.</p><h2 id="the-s-pen-lingers-2">The S Pen lingers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-32" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hinges hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Flip 7 was also discussed, as Samsung finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-flagship-launch-flip-7-fe">provided it with a full cover display</a> (4-inch) that reaches edge-to-edge for a more immersive experience. Samsung worked in a more "compact" form factor for the device, while also boosting its battery by ~300mAh to 4,300mAh.</p><p>You may remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-flagship-foldable-production-rumors">some earlier rumors</a> that said the Galaxy Z Fold 7 would debut with a standalone S Pen that required charging. That didn't happen. The reason for this memory jog is that rumors claimed this S Pen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-fold-phone-might-work-with-an-s-pen-you-need-to-charge">would need to be charged</a> (since there's no digitizer), <em>and </em>the pen would be slightly larger. Speculation claimed Samsung was looking into adding active electrostatic (AES) technology so the pen could manage its own operations. Such additions would likely expand its size, but taking into account Kang's comments, perhaps Samsung is moving in a different direction.</p><p>For now, our current reality is this: the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has no S Pen. If you're interested in that useful tool, you'll have to look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">the Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Samsung's executive vice president and head of customer experience, Patrick Chomet, once told CNET, "We could put it in, but it's not the main feedback from people, and therefore getting it thinner and lighter is more important."</p><p>This pretty much echoes what Kang Min-seok said after Samsung's summer Unpacked. Chomet added, "Many people use the S Pen, but far from the majority of users."</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The issue has been reported to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://0din.ai/blog/phishing-for-gemini" target="_blank">0din</a>, Mozilla’s AI-focused bug bounty program (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-gemini-flaw-hijacks-email-summaries-for-phishing/" target="_blank">BleepingComputer</a>).</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-is-now-in-gmail-to-write-summaries-and-craft-replies-on-the-fly">slipped Gemini into its Workspace apps a while back</a>, and one of its handy tricks is breaking down your emails. Just slide open the side panel in Gmail, and Gemini will be able to pull key details or turn messages into calendar events on the fly.</p><p>But here’s the scary part: this feature also opens the door to “prompt-injection” attacks. If someone slips a sneaky prompt into an email, Gemini might run it right in the side panel, and the user might not even notice.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2381px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.82%;"><img id="LW7Ernz47VjzFbTtMribx7" name="Google-Gemini-summary-in-Gmail" alt="malicious Gemini summary in Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LW7Ernz47VjzFbTtMribx7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2381" height="1972" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marco Figueroa / Odin)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2620px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:84.20%;"><img id="DfyQnL4ArCprqhzstuyD28" name="Google-Gemini-summary-in-Gmail" alt="malicious Gemini summary in Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DfyQnL4ArCprqhzstuyD28.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2620" height="2206" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marco Figueroa / Odin)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Hackers can hide secret commands in emails using simple HTML and CSS tricks like white text on a white background or font size zero. You won’t notice a thing, but Gemini will read it loud and clear, and that’s where things can go sideways.</p><p>Since these sneaky emails skip the usual red flags (no sketchy links or shady attachments), they often slip right past Google’s spam filters and land straight in your inbox.</p><h2 id="wolf-in-google-s-clothing-2">Wolf in Google’s clothing</h2><p>Gemini sees those hidden prompts as legit and spits them out in the email summary with zero warnings. Since it’s coming from Google’s own AI, it looks totally above board, which means most folks won’t even think to question it. That false sense of trust is what makes this so dangerous.</p><p>According to BleepingComputer, even though prompt injection has been on the radar since 2024 and some guardrails are already in place, this tactic still works. That means the current defenses aren’t quite keeping up with how crafty attackers are getting.</p><p>Google says there’s no sign of hackers actually using this trick in real-world attacks thus far. But the research clearly shows it can be done, which raises a big red flag. Just because it hasn’t hit the wild yet doesn’t mean it’s not a serious threat waiting to happen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company has upgraded the Phone 3 with a faster processor and better cameras. The Phone 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-grabs-snapdragon-8s-gen-4-for-its-upcoming-flagship-phone-3">opted for Qualcomm's</a> Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, instead of the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Skipping all the jargon, Nothing CEO Carl Pei said the chip helps make the phone feel "a lot snappier."</p><p>The phone's rear camera array consists of three 50MP lenses, and Nothing even popped one onto the front. One of the larger changes regards the Phone 3's Glyph Lighting, or rather lack thereof. Nothing has implemented instead its new GlyphMatrix, a smaller circular display on the back of the phone. Users can switch between a battery indicator, a stopwatch, a mirror, a digital clock, a solar clock, and more on this Matrix.</p><p>The Headphone 1, the company's first over-ear headset, features a set of physical buttons, a paddle, and roller control. It feels a little more retro, but with Nothing's eye-catching design. The Headphone 1 packs ANC that can adapt to your surroundings, so you're tunes never feel out of... tune.</p><h2 id="committing-to-the-phone-3-2">Committing to the Phone 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="XCAUZSvDwAK6rYDD9YsERR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XCAUZSvDwAK6rYDD9YsERR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In June, amidst Nothing's preparations for the Phone 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-android-os-upgrades-five-year-confirmation">the company confirmed</a> that it is going to provide five major Android OS upgrades for the device. Joining those five major Android updates are seven years of security updates, just to take users a little further.

So you can still give an important app a "full" Tile space, but group other apps below it, if you prefer.</p><p>Unfortunately, Google and third-party apps only have traditional, full-Tile layouts; they don't appear as an option when you edit multi-app Tiles. The Gemini tile, for example, already has the Wear OS 6 look, with rounded edges and finite space for two saved commands.</p><p>I assume (or at least hope) Samsung will let other Wear OS app developers make their own mini-Tile views. Because they've become an instant favorite, allowing me to fit more apps into my routine without having to commit an <em>entire</em> Tile to something I won't use every day.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-and-pixel-watch-4-took-two-different-tile-paths-2">The Galaxy Watch 8 and Pixel Watch 4 took two different Tile paths</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a5EjfN7gpNfWueZfXrEVRG" name="Wear-OS-6-Google-Home" alt="The new Google Home tile on Wear OS 6 on the Pixel Watch 3, showing options to check your Kitchen, Thermo, Custom, Doorbell, and Bedroom controls." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a5EjfN7gpNfWueZfXrEVRG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="m23b4XmgZ7iRAitHxemYX9" name="Wear-OS-6-Gmail" alt="The new Gmail tile for "Your mail" on Wear OS 6 on the Pixel Watch 3, showing two emails about lunch and dinner from different contacts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m23b4XmgZ7iRAitHxemYX9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3864" height="2173" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3651px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ouoJQnbvKuG5jyCyzkp4nF" name="Wear-OS-6-weather" alt="The new Weather tile on Wear OS 6, showing three narrow tiles for Now, 5PM, and 6PM temperatures in London." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ouoJQnbvKuG5jyCyzkp4nF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3651" height="2054" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2990px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YcUnxsaZ9dN3FXm9rwZWKV" name="Wear-OS-6-Contacts" alt="The Contacts Tile on Wear OS 6 on the Pixel Watch 3, showing different contact icons for individual numbers and an All Contacts button on the bottom edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YcUnxsaZ9dN3FXm9rwZWKV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2990" height="1682" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-tested-early-wear-os-6-build-on-pixel-watch-3-at-google-io-2025">tried out Wear OS 6 at Google I/O</a>, I was impressed by Google's redesigned Tiles because they took full advantage of the display space. You can avoid opening individual apps because the Tile will jump-start your search for the most relevant information or shortcuts.</p><p>Now that I've seen Samsung's take on Wear OS 6, I find this fundamental difference fascinating. Samsung's Tiles system feels much more like customizing your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> home screen so that you can swipe left to your organized apps and widgets.

For one, I prefer seeing more information at once, even if it's smaller. For another, I find it easier to scroll <em>down</em> through one themed Health tile and decide which option to tap, rather than have to memorize my Tile order and settle on one thing at a time.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="DLCGjr9DFQ9njdP3sthmNE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Tile-size-options" alt="The "Add Tile" view on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing two sizes of Antioxidant Index widget." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DLCGjr9DFQ9njdP3sthmNE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Two Tile size options for the Antioxidant Index metric </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Tile" alt="The Gemini widget on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">One fixed size option for the Gemini Tile </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I'm not writing off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> UI until I thoroughly test it.

Think of it a bit like when Bob Ross dips his paintbrush into a crimson red, then an azure blue to make some kind of lovely purple for a mountainscape.</p><p>But temporal dithering, also known as FRC or Frame Rate Control, is different. Instead of just showing a solid set of colors to create one color, temporal dithering flashes subpixels back and forth between colors to create a color that doesn't exist. Your eye sees this "new" color because that's how the human eye works. Flash something fast enough in front of one, and it starts seeing a solid or moving image instead of a series of flashing images.</p><p>It's a clever engineering trick that saves companies R&D dollars, allowing them to use cheaper panels and still get away with saying their phones or displays show "billions of colors," even if they technically can't. But of course, just as is the case with PWM dimming, displaying a flashing light or color to some people will cause them to get headaches, nausea, or, at worst, a seizure.</p><h2 id="avoiding-it-is-nearly-impossible-2">Avoiding it is nearly impossible</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fvNWBxgkDjJ6KhdDS5KeaS" name="dithering-testing-using-microscrope-on-honor-tablet-02" alt="Testing to see if the Honor Pad V9 uses temporal dithering by using a OnePlus 13's 480FPS slow motion video and a Carson MicroFlip smartphone microscope" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fvNWBxgkDjJ6KhdDS5KeaS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>People sensitive to temporal dithering have a much harder time finding suitable devices for three main reasons. First, while some monitor companies readily list FRC on spec sheets, smartphone companies do not.</p><p>That means the only way to know if a phone or tablet uses dithering is by either experiencing symptoms or finding a review that dives deep into the display. I try to include these numbers on any review I publish, but I'm just one person, and there are far too many devices for me to be able to test on my own.</p><p>Aside from finding the existence of flickering itself, there's no published rate at which these pixels flicker. At least with PWM dimming, most manufacturers now advertise the existence of PWM dimming and the dimming rate. Phones from brands like Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel run at a very slow 240-480Hz rate, while other brands like OnePlus and Honor push that number up to between 2160Hz and 4320Hz. The faster, the better for humans.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ibisLkmWgzvsbXc5DkEa3C" name="iqoo-z10-neo-eye-care-settings" alt="Eye protection settings on the Iqoo Z10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ibisLkmWgzvsbXc5DkEa3C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No one knows how fast pixels flash when temporal dithering is used, outside of the engineering teams that create the algorithms, of course. Because of this, there's no way to know which phones have a "safe" level of flickering and which are bad for you. All we know is that when phones employ temporal dithering, some users experience real pain and cannot use those phones.</p><p>Lastly, there's no specific color, app, or even activity on the phone that could trigger temporal dithering to activate. Some companies use temporal dithering around the edge of text to make it smoother or more "readable," while other companies may use it to enhance animations and make them more attractive looking. It's a total mixed bag, and it makes figuring out the right phone an extraordinarily difficult process if you're sensitive to it!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="GPQxq6ULrrsVCE5YV6cHtP" name="temporal-dithering-example-oled" alt="An example comparing OLED panels that use color dithering/FRC to another panel that does not" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GPQxq6ULrrsVCE5YV6cHtP.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you want to test for yourself, I recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Carson-Microscope-Smartphone-Digiscoping-MP-250/dp/B015MS8O48/">this $20 smartphone microscope</a> from Amazon. Find a phone that can do at least 240FPS slow motion video capture — I prefer the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> because both phones can capture 480FPS slow motion — and run the microscope over different parts of the screen.</p><p>I often test around the edges of text, on different icons on the home screen, and on both a rainbow gradient and a grayscale gradient. If you see pixels "dancing" between colors, it's likely your display dithers. Check out the GIF above to see what it might look like, as an example.</p><p>The subpixels on the right side are flashing between two colors constantly, while the display on the left is displaying solid colors. This was captured on what looks to my eyes like a solid color, so this movement isn't the result of an animation on screen.</p><h2 id="what-s-the-solution-2">What's the solution?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Jka6Qc2Xbz5VGGfLnce8Ro" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-nxtvision-settings" alt="Adjusting the NXTVISION settings on an NXTPAPER 4.0-powered TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jka6Qc2Xbz5VGGfLnce8Ro.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most immediate thing you can do <em>right now</em> is hop over to the AOSP issue tracker and click the +1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/430486442">on the temporal dithering issue</a>. If you're affected, share your story in the comments and officially put your name on the tracker. It's like signing a petition, but with a lot more weight behind it. This tells Android engineers that this issue needs to be prioritized in future Android updates. Otherwise, they have no idea there's a problem!</p><p>Now, on to the companies that make the smartphones. Since 10-bit color has become the new industry standard for display excellence, companies need to use 10-bit displays whenever possible. An 8-bit screen can display 256 different shades of red, green, or blue in its subpixels, while a 10-bit screen ramps this up to a possible 1024 hues per subpixel.</p><p>In general, only OLED can properly display 10-bit color without any sort of dithering nonsense. If you see an LCD that claims it's 10-bit, the manufacturer is likely being misleading. Even many 8-bit LCDs use 6-bit panels and employ FRC/dithering to achieve an 8-bit or 10-bit color palette.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aZsffDvc8HtLMyGPmSzt8d" name="mudita-kompact-vs-minimal-phone-back-cameras-03" alt="Comapring the camera software on the Minimal Phone to the Mudita Kompakt" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZsffDvc8HtLMyGPmSzt8d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The problem with OLED is that it cannot be fully DC-dimmed like a traditional lightbulb. There is no such thing as a completely flicker-free OLED. It's impossible. Instead, there are "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">safe ranges</a>" that exist for most users, but a subset of users will never be able to use OLED because of this problem.</p><p>Those folks <em>need</em> an accessibility option that allows them to disable dithering or FRC completely. Otherwise, the only safe options are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/an-e-ink-phone-isnt-something-you-just-switch-to-in-one-day">E Ink phones</a>, and all of those have some sort of significant limitations for modern workflows or usages. I recently wrote about how TCL has removed temporal dithering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/tcl-nxtpaper-4-fixes-one-of-the-technologys-biggest-hidden-issues">on its latest NXTPAPER 4.0 tablets</a> when using specific settings, and we need to see other manufacturers start doing the same.</p><p>This is particularly important for LCDs, as users who are the most sensitive to flicker either have to choose between an LCD or an E Ink device. Introducing something like FRC/dithering to an LCD completely defeats the point of these displays as a safe medium, and both hardware manufacturers and OS developers like Google need to implement ways of turning this off completely.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5zAVBxAPszK4664MpG9UeC" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-vs-honor-pad-v9-home-screens" alt="Comparing the displays between the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus and the Honor Pad V9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5zAVBxAPszK4664MpG9UeC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The aforementioned Android bug report has already been assigned to an engineer and tagged as a "feature request" in hopes of getting a new accessibility option for affected users. Google has had accessibility options in place for color blind users for years, which statistically make up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/">less than 4%</a> of the world's population. We don't know the number of people negatively affected by color dithering, but we know that people who <em>are</em> affected by it cannot use any phone with it at all.</p><p>This is an important differentiator between some accessibility options, which are made simply for comfort or convenience reasons, and the one we're asking Google to make. Without this new option, an entire subset of users may be unable to use any Android phones at all, especially as support for older phones ends.</p><p>Android is, by far, the world's largest operating system, and that statistic isn't changing anytime soon. Now that we know Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-exec-android-gemini-future-os-interview-report">is combining ChromeOS and Android</a>, that number is only going to get higher. Now is the time to act, Google. I know you can do it, and now that you know it's a problem, I hope it's only a matter of time before we get a fix.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e8f55126-665c-4040-82a7-4eb43977e555">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zcr4Z8qwujAeqMm5gfzGGn.jpg' alt="An official render of the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet's display and rear camera module"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>TCL's latest tablet employs NXTPAPER 4.0, the newest evolution in TCL's unique ePaper display that features even better eye comfort modes than previous generations.

The company teased today a glammed-out Razr 2025.</p><p>YTECHB previously reported about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-allegedly-preparing-crystal-bedazzled-razr-2025-leak">leaked render showing a crystal-covered Motorola Razr</a>, hinting at a design echoing the special edition Buds Loop. Motorola’s latest teaser seems to back it up, and according to the same leak, the phone is coming in an “Ice Blue” finish.</p><p>The short clip shows crystals being carefully embedded into the Buds Loop, hinting that this similar style is coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025</a>.

So, if you were hoping for a bedazzled Razr Plus or Ultra, it’s probably not happening.</p><p>This special edition likely won’t bring major spec changes compared to the standard Razr 2025. With the base model already packing solid upgrades, the Swarovski version is all about the looks: a polished finish on an already refined device.</p><p>We're counting down the days to August 5 to see the full reveal of this new collaboration.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The 45mm model goes by the codename “kenari” (FK23), and the 41mm one is called “meridian” (FME23)—both nods to Star Wars planets, which is a fun shift from Google’s usual god-themed names.</p><p>As usual, expect both LTE and Wi-Fi-only versions for each size.</p><p>Google might be putting in the work to squeeze out every drop of efficiency. The report notes a slight battery bump for both Pixel Watch 4 models: a 7% boost for the 41mm and a 9% jump for the 45mm with a 459mAh cell. It’s not a huge leap, but it could help stretch out battery life just a bit more on Google’s next-gen watch.</p><p>Additionally, faster charging is reportedly on the way.

This discovery, powered by insights from the Google Threat Intelligence Group, shows how AI can now catch bugs before they blow up.</p><p>Big Sleep was built to think like a human security expert, digging through code and spotting shady behaviors just like a real researcher would. Google also designed it to catch sneaky twists on known bugs, which are a goldmine for hackers looking to mess with modern software.</p><p>Additionally, Google’s open-source digital forensics tool, Timesketch, is getting a powerful AI boost. Backed by a new model called Sec-Gemini, the upgraded platform can now do some of the heavy lifting in forensic investigations, like sifting through logs and flagging potential threats. This means less work for analysts and much faster incident response. A live demo is set for Black Hat USA.</p><h2 id="facade-google-s-secret-insider-threat-catcher-2">FACADE: Google’s secret insider threat catcher</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1466px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="RJDyHw3W2cZ9f9auHorGW" name="android-security.jpg" alt="Android logo on a phone with a padlock in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RJDyHw3W2cZ9f9auHorGW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1466" height="825" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another internal tool is stepping into the spotlight. Google will share a behind-the-scenes look at FACADE, its insider threat detection system that’s been quietly monitoring billions of daily events since 2018. It doesn’t need training data from past attacks to spot anomalies, thanks to a machine learning approach called contrastive learning.</p><p>At DEF CON 33, Google is also co-hosting a Capture the Flag (CTF) event with Airbus. Teams will get help from AI assistants to tackle a wide range of security puzzles. It’s a fresh spin that puts AI in the trenches with security pros and hobbyists alike.</p><p>Google is also putting its weight behind safer AI development. It’s donating data from its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-saif-risk-assessment-security-threats-details">Secure AI Framework</a> (SAIF) to the Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI), helping fuel work around agentic AI, software supply chain security, and cyber defense. This move follows the initiative's launch at last year’s Aspen Security Forum.</p><p>And finally, next month marks the end of the AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC), a DARPA-led competition supported by Google. The winners will show off new AI tools built to find and fix vulnerabilities in major open-source software, a major step forward for proactive digital defense.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are three case sizes in total: 40mm, 44mm, and 46mm.

Meanwhile, the upsized Galaxy Watch 8 Classic with the popular rotating bezel is only available in one 46mm case size. Customers can choose from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/which-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-color-should-you-buy">Black and White color options</a> when shopping for the Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>Choosing the right case size when buying a wearable depends on the size of your wrists. If you've got big hands, a larger case size like 44mm or 46mm, is best suited. Something as small as 40mm may not be proportional and might end up looking strange or funny. You don't want to seem like you accidentally wore a kids' smartwatch.</p><p>Naturally, the petite 40mm case size looks the most aesthetically pleasing on tinier wrists. It's also more functional. You don't want an oversized, chunky wearable that covers the entirety of your wrist, feels heavy, and ends up knocking around every single thing in close proximity to your hands.</p><p>Small wrists have a disadvantage when looking at the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, because it only comes in a gigantic 46mm case size. So you'll be stuck between the Watch 8's 40mm or 44mm variants if you have smaller hands.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Of course, inflation, tariff uncertainty, and a host of other factors might explain the price hike, but this just goes to show that the decision of whether to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is more complicated than ever.</p><p>People considering an upgrade will have to look at their current phone and figure out whether having the newest Samsung foldable is worth the high cost. For anyone with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">recent foldable</a> from Samsung, Google, or OnePlus, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is probably out of reach — unless you take advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-deals">insane pre-order trade-in deals</a>. It's easier to justify an upgrade with an older model because the changes compound across multiple generations.</p><p>Let's dive into the Galaxy Z Fold 7's price and specs to help you figure out whether you should upgrade or pass.</p><h2 id="should-you-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-from-a-galaxy-z-fold-6-2">Should you upgrade to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 from a Galaxy Z Fold 6?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5naTkQoLMYoejCq4GVAp3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-mint-hands-on-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5naTkQoLMYoejCq4GVAp3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> was already a standout foldable, and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 builds off those initial upgrades. Is there enough added to the newer model to make current owners want to upgrade? That probably depends on who you ask. There are a lot of noticeable changes, but it'll be tough to justify spending $2,000 on a foldable just one year after spending $1,900 on the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">major differences between these two models</a> will be their display sizes and form factors. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has bigger inner and outer screens, measuring 8 inches on the main display and 6.5 inches on the cover screen. That's up from a 7.6-inch main screen and a 6.3-inch cover screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Most importantly, the newer model has a wider cover screen, which should make typing and general use more comfortable.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications </caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Folding display</p></td><td  ><p>8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2184 x 1968 QXGA+</p></td><td  ><p>7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2160 x 1856 resolution, 20.9:18 aspect ratio, 374 ppi, 2600 nits peak brightness, 480Hz PWM dimming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover display</p></td><td  ><p>6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 2520 x 1080 HD+, Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2376 x 968 resolution, 22.1:9 aspect ratio, 410 ppi, 2600 nits peak brightness, 480Hz PWM dimming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating System</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (One UI 8)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 14 (One UI 6.1.1) [upgradeable]</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor </p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, or 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, or 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery </p></td><td  ><p>4,400mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,400mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging </p></td><td  ><p>25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 4.5 reverse wireless</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 4.5 reverse wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras </p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 12MP ultrawide + 10MP telephoto (3x optical zoom)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 12MP ultrawide + 10MP telephoto (3x optical zoom)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie cameras </p></td><td  ><p>10MP (cover display) + 10MP (folding display)</p></td><td  ><p>10MP (cover display) + 4MP (folding display)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9 mm (folded); 158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2 mm (unfolded)</p></td><td  ><p>Folded (68.1 x 153.5 x 12.1 mm); Unfolded (132.6 x 153.5 x 5.6 mm)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>215g</p></td><td  ><p>239g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Silver Shadow, Blue Shadow, Jetblack</p></td><td  ><p>Silver, Shadow, Pink, Navy</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is <em>significantly</em> thinner and lighter than its predecessor, which is probably the most compelling reason to upgrade. It's only 8.9mm thick when closed, and that means you can add a case to it if you'd like while still remaining under the Galaxy Z Fold 7's 12.1mm thickness. Meanwhile, the new version weighs only 215 grams, and that's less than every big flagship from Apple, Google, and Samsung.</p><p>Hardware upgrades are a mixed bag. The new model has the advantage of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip</a> and a 200MP camera, but the Galaxy Z Fold 6's comparable offerings are no slouch. You probably won't notice that big of a difference in performance during daily use. Plus, the amount of RAM, battery capacity, and charging speed is completely unchanged between models.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 half-opened with the display on.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it would be nice to have the thinner and lighter Galaxy Z Fold 7, most Galaxy Z Fold 6 users should probably stick with the phone they have for another year.

It was tough to go from Galaxy S25 Edge to a thicker device, and I absolutely noticed a difference holding the Galaxy Z Fold 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>Still, we're talking about $2,000 here. Unless you have boatloads of cash, there just isn't enough to justify the upgrade from the prior model.

Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, which is only two years old, is starting to show its age. It has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip that wasn't built for the AI era, and a 6.2-inch cover screen that isn't wide enough by 2025 standards. Additionally, the phone's 252-gram weight and 13.4mm thickness when folded is pretty chunky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5">compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><p>There are positives to sticking with the Galaxy Z Fold 5, as it has the same battery capacity, charging speed, and secondary cameras as the newer Galaxy Z Fold 7.

These Galaxy foldables had the older wedge-shaped hinge with a gap between the two halves of the phone. This not only made the foldables thicker but also less durable. Samsung's hinge design and build quality have vastly improved since this generation of foldables, and there are many reasons to upgrade.</p><p>For those with a Galaxy Z Fold 5 or a Galaxy Z Fold 4, an upgrade to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 makes a lot of sense. Samsung is offering $900 of trade-in credit for the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and $800 for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 toward the newer model, which is excellent. It means your device will have retained about half of its value even after two or three years of use. If you like the Galaxy Z Fold form factor and have no regrets, I'd jump on this Galaxy Z Fold 7 pre-order offer now before your phone loses value.</p><h2 id="should-you-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-from-a-pixel-fold-pixel-9-pro-fold-or-oneplus-open-2">Should you upgrade to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 from a Pixel Fold, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, or OnePlus Open?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on fence railing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anyone with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a>, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, or OnePlus Open should probably take a pause before jumping toward the new Galaxy Z Fold 7.

Many of Samsung's new additions, like a wider cover screen and thin form factor, have been staples of Google and OnePlus foldables.</p><p>For example, while the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the thinnest foldable available in the U.S., the Pixel 9 Pro Fold measures 10.5mm when folded, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/you-should-love-the-oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a> measures 11.7mm when folded. Both of those are still thinner than the Galaxy Z Fold 6.

That streak will soon be broken, as the RG477M was announced in a 21-second video published to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@anbernic">Anbernic's YouTube channel</a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RBArKfpkZE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The company didn't provide any further details besides showing off some quick B-roll footage. This confirmed the metal shell along with the button, joystick, and D-pad placement. And although it wasn't mentioned, it's safe to assume that the joysticks will have RGB lighting, based on the close-up shots in the video.</p><p>However, based on Anbernic's history, there are a few gaps we can try to fill just from the name. With only a couple of exceptions, the majority of Anbernic handhelds carry a naming scheme of "RGXXYZZ," and are broken down as such:</p><ul><li><strong>XX -</strong> Screen Size</li><li><strong>Y - </strong>Processor</li><li><strong>ZZ -</strong> Version</li></ul><p>So, looking at the RG477M, Anbernic's next handheld will feature a 4.7-inch screen. The "7" likely denotes a more powerful chip, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gemini-notebooklm-gaming-guide-creation">RG557</a>, making use of the MediaTek Dimensity 8300. And the "M" simply denotes that it will feature a metal shell.</p><p>Provided that Anbernic doesn't throw a curveball, it's pretty safe to assume that the RG477M will feature similar internals to those of the RG557. In addition to the Dimensity 8300, the RG557 includes 12GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="nVK46NxPnCeAFZm4VY96mb" name="anbernic-rg477m-teaser-video-screengrabs-6" alt="Anbernic RG477M promo banner render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVK46NxPnCeAFZm4VY96mb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="RNffGvaN4E7ZKVHPcJGAkb" name="anbernic-rg477m-teaser-video-screengrabs-4" alt="Anbernic RG477M bronze shell - angled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RNffGvaN4E7ZKVHPcJGAkb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="QbCNu6FgSCu7rwZTfBeajb" name="anbernic-rg477m-teaser-video-screengrabs-5" alt="Anbernic RG477M silver/gunmetal close-up on left joystick" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QbCNu6FgSCu7rwZTfBeajb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One interesting tidbit to note is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/products/rgslide">Anbernic RG Slide</a> from June features a 4.7-inch IPS display, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1280x960 resolution. It wouldn't come as any surprise if Anbernic ended up using the same panel from the RG Slide in the forthcoming RG477M.</p><p>That being said, we probably won't have to wait very long to learn more about what Anbernic has been working on. Once the initial teaser video is released, the company usually trickles out more information on a semi-rapid pace, leading up to pre-orders being made available. Given that retro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a> with metal shells don't come around very often, I'll be keeping a close eye on the launch of the RG477M.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Diving in supposedly provided the tipster with Google's early design of the feature. Reminiscent of At a Glance, Gemini Spaces will seemingly appear as a widget users can place on their home and lock screens.</p><p>Regarding the latter, the Gemini Spaces card will appear above your Pixel's lock screen clock if the larger numbers are used. If the smaller clock is chosen, the cards will appear right beneath it. The cards on the home screen seem relatively the same; however, the tipster offered a look at its Sports and Calendar event (birthday), which delivered a transparent background for the latter.</p><p>Another important detail is the dots right beneath Gemini Spaces cards.</p><p>These dots seem to indicate users can swipe through whatever Gemini has procured for the user. AssembleDebug was able to swipe from some sports scores to the calendar event, and it looks like there's room for more (if only Google had it working). The tipster adds that these cards should display finance information alongside what was already working early on. Considering Gemini's involvement, it's likely we'll see a whole host of topics/genres available in its new "Spaces" cards.</p><h2 id="gemini-becomes-integral-2">Gemini becomes integral</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:265px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:226.42%;"><img id="SZUbz5m4VKo44PMkJrU3NJ" name="google-gemini-spaces-at-a-glance-lock-screen-leak" alt="A leaked screenshot of Google's "Gemini Spaces" redesign for At a Glance showing a birthday calendar event." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SZUbz5m4VKo44PMkJrU3NJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="265" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="SDf8W3Hdgk5PjVuZLZzFNJ" name="google-gemini-spaces-at-a-glance-home-screen-leak" alt="A screenshot leak of a Pixel's home screen, showing sports scores, courtesy of Google's rumored "Gemini Spaces" feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SDf8W3Hdgk5PjVuZLZzFNJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="266" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>In June, Google's development of "Gemini Spaces" was reported. Those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-give-at-a-glance-a-gemini-makeover-with-extra-smarts">early reports</a> claim the feature was similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Samsung's Now Bar</a>, a feature that delivers real-time information on whatever your interests are. It was originally reported to be a feature for your lock screen, but as we've now seen, it seems Google plans for this to be a true Gemini-fueled successor to At a Glance for your home screen, too.</p><p>The initial report was mostly code; however, that early code showed Gemini Spaces is aiming to "go beyond" what At a Glance can currently do: weather and calendar events. Only finance information and sports scores have been alleged, but it's not hard to imagine what else Gemini can pull for us. Perhaps sales on products we like or quick news blurbs.</p><p>What's more interesting is how much of Android Gemini is moving into. The AI has truly become a part of Google's vision <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-exec-android-gemini-future-os-interview-report">about the future of Android</a>, according to its president of Android Ecosystem, Sameer Samat. Not only is Google planning to merge ChromeOS with Android, but Gemini is taking center stage. Per Samat, Gemini has turned Android into a "helpful experience," which the company undoubtedly plans to evolve.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These featured notebooks already have everything you'd need available, as well as the option to generate an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overview</a>. These topics, such as the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/19bde485-a9c1-4809-8884-e872b2b67b44">Complete Works of William Shakespeare</a>," have a mind map available to see how things connect.</p><p>Users retain the option to pose questions to the AI to get a little more understanding. However, if you're more interested in reading, you can certainly do that. Gemini's AI summary will be located at the top of those lengthy texts, just in case, too. NotebookLM's "featured notebooks" are rolling out today (July 14) for desktop computers.</p><h2 id="notebooklm-helps-streamline-learning-2">NotebookLM helps streamline learning</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUUZlcUgEis" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Users will also find these publicly available notebooks, courtesy of this new feature:</p><ul><li>Longevity advice from Eric Topol</li><li>A science fan’s guide to visiting Yellowstone National Park</li><li>An overview of long-term trends in human wellbeing, published by the University of Oxford-affiliated project, Our World In Data</li><li>Science-backed parenting advice from psychology professor Jacqueline Nesi</li><li>A notebook tracking the Q1 earnings reports from the top 50 public companies worldwide</li></ul><p>The feature currently rolling out for NotebookLM feels like an extension of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/public-notebooks-are-coming-to-notebooklm-for-easy-sharing-and-studying">Public Notebooks</a>, which debuted in June. Kind of like sharing a Google Doc, users can compile their latest notebook in the app and share a link with other users, so they can see and interact with it, too. Considering NotebookL:M is about studying and learning about topics in a way that doesn't feel so heavy, teachers and other educators may find this useful.</p><p>Topics that you need to teach or learn about take center stage without all the other fluff that doesn't matter. Moreover, your sources are clear, and if you need to scour the internet for them, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">NotebookLM would take care of it</a>.</p><p>Google rolled out Discover Sources in the app this spring, which takes away the necessity for users to search around manually for important sources. Now, users need only describe their topic and let NotebookLM look around and add in what's important. The AI will display what it found, leaving it in the user's hands to go through and check off which ones they want and don't want.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The device was reportedly spotted moving through the World Power Consortium (WPC) for certification purposes. There, the Qi2 wireless standard was noted; however, the listing failed to detail its charging strength. The flagship Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-fast-samsung-galaxy-s25-charging-speed">boasts 15W wireless support</a>, so <em>maybe </em>we're looking at that here, too.</p><p>Samsung's flagship Galaxy S25 series is also where it seems to want to bring its Galaxy S25 FE closer to—charging-wise, that is.

While it might also see two-year-old Samsung tech—the Exynos 1380 SoC—a report claimed the company had started testing it with One UI 7. It suggests the device has "progressed" in its development cycle, as rumors purport a fall launch alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-battery-specifications-leak">main Galaxy Tab S11 lineup</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The goal was simple: build a website using Gemini detailing the history of Android.</p><p>Since then, we've been a little busy around these parts, so the project was slightly delayed. I was determined to come up with a (mostly) final result, but wasn't really a fan of the site design that I shared before.</p><p>As a result, I basically started over, firing up Google AI Studio and using a combination of prompts and my own knowledge to reach the goal. So, without further ado, I introduce you to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://androidrewind.com/">AndroidRewind.com</a>.</p><h2 id="android-rewind-2">Android Rewind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NFjPeACJRmYqqz2RQsoe6c" name="android-rewind-home-page-screenshot" alt="Android Rewind home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NFjPeACJRmYqqz2RQsoe6c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3896" height="2191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Funnily enough, Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand recently published his own "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-evolution-of-android-decades-of-transformation">ode to Android</a>," providing snapshots of history since Google acquired Android Inc. back in July 2005. I implore you to check that out before anything else, as you'll get a Jerry-infused history lesson, and there's really nothing better than that.</p><p>As for Android Rewind, I wanted to provide digestible snippets about Android over the years. So you'll find the following landing pages:</p><ul><li><strong>Releases - A timeline of every major version of Android:</strong> Each entry shows the Codename, Release month/year, and Key Features.</li><li><strong>Devices - The hardware that defined generations of Android: </strong>Clicking a device will pull up the full name, OEM, release month/year, and a brief description.</li><li><strong>OEMs - The companies that build the hardware for the Android ecosystem: </strong>Select a company to view the name, primary location, and a bit about each company's impact.</li><li><strong>Notable Figures - The architects and visionaries behind Android: </strong>This one's pretty self-explanatory.</li></ul><p>Initially, the home page was nothing more than the header and a block of text at the top, along with the boxes at the bottom. But that was a bit too bland and boring for my taste, so I prompted Gemini to add a background image to the header section. More importantly, there's also the "Recent Release History," which is just an overview of the last five Android versions.</p><p>Almost all of the images you see on the site were sourced from the Android Central archives. With the exceptions being on the Figures page and images for the very early days of Android releases. Oh, right, and the actual website logo, which I asked Gemini to create and then tweaked to get what you see.</p><h2 id="lean-on-gemini-or-do-it-yourself-2">Lean on Gemini, or do it yourself</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3924px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3bAgZVNZbZgEcydFETvw2c" name="android-rewind-code-assistant-file-tree-preview" alt="Code Assistant with Files and Preview in Google AI Studio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3bAgZVNZbZgEcydFETvw2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3924" height="2208" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since basically this entire website is built using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, that means there's no "backend" or CMS for me to interact with. So after I managed to get most of the pieces in place, I realized I needed a way to edit the content on the page.</p><p>Following the path of least resistance, I just asked Gemini to make certain elements editable. Then, I realized that all I really needed to do was edit the website code myself.</p><p>That kind of speaks to the versatility of working with Gemini, at least from the confines of Google AI Studio. Basically, if you want or need Gemini to do the legwork for you, it's right there. But if you want to take a more hands-on approach, that's also at your disposal.</p><h2 id="a-few-headaches-2">A few headaches</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3931px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cfbkpJWrGtmwQgamaBcr2c" name="android-rewind-google-cloud-deployment-revisions" alt="Android Rewind Google Cloud Deployment History" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cfbkpJWrGtmwQgamaBcr2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3931" height="2211" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Gemini made all of this possible, not everything about building Android Rewind was smooth sailing. The most frustrating aspect was when I wanted to revisit the project at a later time, in order to make changes before the final push.</p><p>It turns out that even after connecting the created app to Google Cloud Run for deployment, there are a couple of ways that I lost progress. The first was actually clicking the "Deploy" button, which results in a pop-up that says the project was "successfully deployed to Google Cloud."</p><p>This is technically true, but it turns out that you have to click the "Redeploy app" if you make any changes to the code. There were a few times in the beginning when I would make changes and hit deploy, thinking that what appeared in the Preview window would be what showed up on the deployed site. That wasn't the case, so I ended up losing a few hours' worth of changes and manual tweaks.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="feePwDWyFAMZLb6avr5Cvb" name="android-rewind-google-cloud-project-deployment-message" alt="Android Rewind Google Cloud Project Deployment from AI Studio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/feePwDWyFAMZLb6avr5Cvb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other frustration I ran into is trying to edit the code after it's been deployed. One might think that you would be able to just come back to the same project in AI Studio later and pick up right where you left off.</p><p>Unless there's something I'm missing, that's not the case. So I had to dig through the Google Cloud Console to find the site code. After downloading the ZIP file, I opened up the initial project in AI Studio, then copied and pasted all of the contents into the specific files, and created new ones where necessary.</p><p>This is something that both Claude and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-havent-used-chatgpt-since-2023-heres-why-gemini-is-all-the-ai-i-need">ChatGPT</a> excel at, as I can close a window and pick right back up where I left off by selecting the pertinent "conversation." Hell, I can even upload an entire ZIP file to either of those and have it make edits for me, while AI Studio only lets me upload individual files and not entire projects.</p><h2 id="looking-to-the-future-2">Looking to the future</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3884px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="AzMrjDtjwDZEaJPxcSvD3c" name="android-rewind-android-release-details" alt="Android Rewind Release window" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AzMrjDtjwDZEaJPxcSvD3c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3884" height="2184" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm pretty happy with the current state of Android Rewind, at least for now. I'm sure that others will tell me about things that are missing, but I'm also going to eventually add more information where it makes sense.</p><p>First, I will add more details to each Android Release and Device entry. I've also toyed around with the idea of having dedicated OEM pages, providing a list of every major device release. Admittedly, I did think about having a full device history, but then I remembered just how many devices Samsung releases any given year, which quickly changed my mind.</p><p>More importantly, I will soon be adding devices like tablets, wearables, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> to the mix. These are all just as important to the history of Android as phones, but for the sake of getting the site launched, I decided to omit them for now.</p><p>Be sure to keep an eye on Android Rewind, as the changes will (hopefully) come swiftly, and with Gemini at my side.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It builds on the original Balance with new features, including HYROX training, scuba support, and a brighter sapphire-glass display. Battery life remains a highlight, easily lasting up to two weeks in everyday use. While it's heavier than past models, it still looks sharp enough to wear all day.</p><p>The Amazfit Balance 2 pushes even closer to Wear OS territory, offering features such as Bluetooth calling through its built-in speaker and microphone. It also supports smart replies with a full QWERTY keyboard, making it easier to respond on the go. You'll find a solid mix of built-in apps, NFC for payments via Zepp Pay. The large 1.5-inch AMOLED display is bright enough for Outdoor use, and the upgraded sapphire glass and aluminum frame give the watch a premium, durable feel.</p><p>That said, the Balance 2 isn't without its drawbacks. Zepp OS also lacks the flexibility and app ecosystem of Wear OS, and message replies, while supported, can occasionally lag or fail to send.

You can choose from a range of colors, including black, charcoal, stone, and red.</p><p>The 14-day battery life is comparable to that of some of the more expensive Amazfit watches on this list, which is impressive. When you compare that to competitors that last for a day or two, this is a great accomplishment. The Amazfit Bip 6 offers over 140 sports modes, including popular options like outdoor running, strength training, and cycling. You'll also find more specialized activities, such as HYROX racing, yoga, and high-intensity interval training, providing fitness enthusiasts with a wide range of options.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-under-100"><span>Best under $100</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2587px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="keaEodb2MAR2ugvAA5t9YE" name="Amazfit-active-2" alt="Amazfit Active 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/keaEodb2MAR2ugvAA5t9YE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2587" height="1455" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazfit)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-amazfit-active-2-2"><span class="title__text">3.

The polycarbonate watch body is available in two unique colors: Desert Black and Sahara. The 1.3-inch AMOLED display has a touchscreen for easy navigation and four side buttons that you can use to navigate the watch if that's your preferred method. The best thing about this design is that it's tough and ideal for outdoor enthusiasts since it has military-grade durability. The Amazfit T-Rex Ultra is easily one of the toughest watches, as it has passed 15 military-grade tests instead of 12 on the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-t-rex-review">Amazfit T-Rex</a>.</p><p>No matter how long you plan to be outdoors, this is also one of the best Amazfit smartwatches for extended battery life. You can expect this beast to last up to 20 days with typical use. Those who use their smartwatch heavily can expect an average of around 12 days. In continuous GPS mode, the battery will last for 28 hours, and you can get as much as 80 hours from the endurance GPS mode. You also get an incredible water resistance rating. The Amazfit T-Rex Ultra can handle a depth of up to 100 meters, also known as 10 ATM water resistance.</p><p>Speaking of tracking, most users will be happy with the Amazfit T-Rex Ultra's health and activity features. You'll have over 160 sports modes, including outdoor cycling, treadmill, trail running, and walking. You can also record specific activities like hiking, climbing, hunting, and more. During a workout, you can also track your route with the built-in advanced GPS. There's also heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and blood oxygen monitoring.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-for-runners"><span>Best for runners</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hM2khnFVp7iFFocYrpDnYU" name="Amazfit-Cheetah-Pro-elevation.jpeg" alt="Elevation widget on the Amazfit Cheetah Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hM2khnFVp7iFFocYrpDnYU.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="5-amazfit-cheetah-pro-2"><span class="title__text">5.

This model offers better GPS features than most smartwatches, with the GPS antenna able to pick up 100% of satellite signals instead of the 50% that most watches can manage. As a result, the Cheetah Pro will let you track your route far more accurately than other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running smartwatches</a> on the market.</p><p>Its slew of features includes 24-hour monitoring of various metrics and multiple triathlete modes. These features make it well worth the price tag, along with over 100 apps and multiple face options to tailor the watch to suit your needs.</p><p>There are arguably <em>too</em> many features here, though, with hidden menus and an overwhelming number of options that don't work as well as they should. This suggests that Amazfit could have benefitted from a little more streamlining rather than going the route of "jack of all trades, master of none."</p><p>However, while running, the watch comes into its own, boasting an impressive 14-hour battery life and a super lightweight design. The price tag is competitive, too, with the number of features justifying a purchase for serious runners.</p><p>The touchscreen is bright and impressive, but it is a little inconsistent during use. Overall, though, the Cheetah Pro is impressive, but it is a little more niche than other offerings on this list.

It's a more premium version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-gtr-mini-review" target="_blank">GTR Mini</a>, but with the price increase comes improved features. Battery life is clearly the standout feature here, as the Balance easily lasted for two weeks on average during our testing. The Amazfit is lightweight and stylish, a great combination that makes you want to wear it constantly.</p><p>The Balance comes close to offering Google Wear OS-like functionality, thanks to its ability to handle incoming calls via the built-in speaker and mic. You can also correctly reply to messages with the full QWERTY keyboard. You get a good selection of apps, NFC for payments (only via the Zepp Pay app), and support for the Alexa voice assistant. The Amazfit Balance also features a large and bright AMOLED display suitable for outdoor use, and its build quality is top-notch.</p><p>However, there are a couple of downsides, like the inconsistent pedometer, which puts it on the no-go list for serious athletes. The OS is also less capable than Wear OS, and message replies tend to hang. Lastly, there's no LTE option, which is a bit of a bummer.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-most-powerful"><span>Most powerful</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ck2SAasqYChQzGxVjDfy5i" name="Amazfit-Falcon-lifestyle-16x9-04.jpg" alt="Amazfit Falcon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ck2SAasqYChQzGxVjDfy5i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="7-amazfit-falcon-2"><span class="title__text">7.

The Amazfit Falcon is one such watch, offering a comprehensive range of health and fitness features. We went <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-falcon-hands-on">hands-on with the Falcon</a> and were impressed with its high-grade titanium chassis and superb battery life.</p><p>The Amazfit Falcon is military-grade resistant to nature's elements, allowing you to participate in any rigorous outdoor activity easily. It uses Zepp OS 3.0, which comes with a ton of advanced features for working out, over 150 sports modes, and health monitoring such as blood oxygen levels and heart rate. The smartwatch has an AI coach to help you achieve your fitness goals.</p><p>The Amazfit Falcon can be expensive, but it could be the watch for you if you're a sports professional or military personnel. It has a touchscreen, but you can also navigate the wearable using the two side buttons.</p><p>Amazfit went the extra mile with the Falcon, which is why it has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazfit.com/blogs/news/amazfit-creates-the-worlds-first-chatgpt-empowered-watch-face">world's first watch face coded by ChatGPT</a>. This doesn't make up for the lack of third-party apps, but seeing an Amazfit smartwatch one-up its competitors, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 3,</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on" target="_blank"> is nice</a>. Samsung and Google's wearables must rely on a roundabout way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-put-chatgpt-on-galaxy-watch-pixel-watch-wear-os">get ChatGPT on Wear OS</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><p>With so many fantastic watches, how <em>do </em>you choose the right one? As with any smartwatch, you first ask yourself why you're getting it. Is it to keep track of steps, specific sports or activities, or get a good handle on your overall health and wellness? Then consider what else you want to do with it. Do you need access to third-party apps? Would you like to load music directly onto your watch? Do you want to read notifications and answer calls or texts directly from your wrist?</p><p>Create a list of features you want the watch to have, as well as the ones you need. Then, run through this list and eliminate or highlight models one by one. Soon, you'll be left with one or two models to choose from. From there, it might come down to price and design: Which one fits better on your wrist, suits your lifestyle, and is more affordable for your pocketbook?</p><p>The good news is that Amazfit has a smartwatch for just about everybody. When you focus on fitness, fashion, or both, you can find a model with everything you need. However, if you're looking for the absolute best Amazfit smartwatch, we highly recommend the Balance. It features a sleek design with fitness tracking capabilities, ensuring exceptional battery life.</p><p>To recap, the Amazfit Balance is equipped with over 150 sport modes, built-in GPS, sleep tracking, heart-rate monitoring, blood oxygen tracking, Amazon Alexa integration, and a microphone and speaker, allowing you to answer calls. It's not the type of watch that you'll have to charge every night, either. With average use, you might only need to charge it once a week.</p><p>Regardless of your preferences, you can likely find an Amazfit smartwatch that meets them. Whether you're a professional athlete looking to track your workouts and improve endurance, a runner training for the next big 5K, or a first-time user just getting started in the smartwatch world, there's bound to be a fitness-focused wearable from Amazfit that's perfect for you.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-we-test"><span>How we test</span></h3><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Why you can trust Android Central</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">☑️ One of the <strong>oldest and most trusted</strong> Android sites on the web<br>☑️ Over <strong>15 years</strong> of product testing<br>☑️ <strong>Thousands </strong>of products reviewed and tested since 2007<br>☑️ <strong>Dozens </strong>of smartwatches tested every year by our team</p></div></div><p>Testing smartwatches at Android Central involves much more than strapping them to our arms and taking a few pictures. Android Central Senior Editor Michael Hicks runs a weekly column called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/sunday-runday">Sunday Runday</a>, where he discusses how smartwatches and exercise can help improve your life and promote health. Other smartwatch reviewers on the team, like Managing Editor Derrek Lee and Senior Editor Nicholas Sutrich, take numerous watches to the gym and competitions, putting them to the test exactly as you might.</p><p>In addition to comparing various watches during workouts, we wear each one to bed to evaluate sleep tracking and take them on long walks to test step accuracy. These everyday routines help us judge comfort, durability, and battery life over time. Therefore, when we recommend a smartwatch, it's because we've thoroughly tested it in real-world conditions and have the data to back it up.</p><p>Then there's the watch's operating system itself. Like Amazfit's smartwatches, many watches use proprietary operating systems that are compatible with Android and iOS devices. However, that can sometimes mean they aren't as full-featured as the OS made by Apple or Google. We take these things into account and ensure that you understand what might be missing from the experience on these watches, because, often, they excel in areas where watches from Google or Apple fall short.</p><p>Of course, all this affects how long a smartwatch's battery lasts. More features can sometimes mean worse battery life, but watches from brands like Amazfit or Garmin aim to help you stay healthier without requiring daily battery charging. We wear our watches for weeks or months to ensure accurate data and testing, so you can expect our battery life estimates to be exact.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The teardown of the HeyMelody <strong>v115.8</strong> version has revealed new code referencing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-use-spotify-tap-samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro">Spotify Tap</a>.</p><p>For the unaware, Spotify Tap is a feature that lets users start playing tracks with a double tap or triple tap on compatible earbuds without the need to unlock the phone or open the Spotify app. The feature is already a prominent one on audio products made by Bose, Jabra, Sony, and Marshall or some Samsung Galaxy Buds, for that matter.

Similarly, the next-gen models are seemingly codenamed "Next Paradigm, " which internally refers to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a>, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra as NPA1, NPA2, and NPA3 model numbers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KMbUhCn4bUehTLkmfqKTya" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-inside-close.jpg" alt="Looking at the electronics on the inside of the gold Samsung Galaxy Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KMbUhCn4bUehTLkmfqKTya.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication further cites "internal databases," which also note that there would be a new successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a>, which is currently being referred to as the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2">Next Smart Ring</a>."

However, going by the recent rumors of Samsung replacing the Plus model in favor of the Edge phone, the NPA2 is likely an indication of the next iteration of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.</p><p>And according to the supposed database, either of the handsets is likely to feature an ultra-wide angle lens featuring a 50MP lens. If it turns out to be accurate, it marks a significant upgrade over the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> and S25 Edge handsets.</p><p>Lastly, there isn't any notable information regarding the NPA1 model, which is likely the regular Galaxy S26 model. Since these are just specs based on the internal codenames and databases, things are likely to change when the devices launch officially sometime early next year, which is at least six months from now.

After that, the headsets will be a fixture for every preseason and regular-season game.

HMD Global, the company behind Nokia-branded smartphones, is shifting its focus away from the U.S. market, leaving fans wondering what this means for the future of the Nokia brand.</p><p>HMD Global told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/705046/hmd-global-nokia-scaling-back-us-market" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that it is scaling back its presence in the U.S., which could mean no new Nokia phones will be launching stateside anytime soon. The company reiterated that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-global/hmd-global-barbie-phone">existing devices will still get support</a>, meaning security updates and warranties will continue as promised.</p><p>The company is calling it “scaling back,” but it looks more like it's fully stepping away from selling phones in the U.S. It’s a quiet exit from a market HMD never quite managed to crack.</p><p>As it stands, all buy buttons are gone from HMD's product pages. You might still spot a few Nokia phones on places like Amazon, but those are probably just leftover inventories, and once they're gone, that’s likely it.</p><h2 id="tariffs-took-a-toll-2">Tariffs took a toll</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="ghtTu477BqoshoXmRuGhUa" name="Nokia-C1-Plus-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Nokia C1 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ghtTu477BqoshoXmRuGhUa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1535" height="863" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nokia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>HMD blames its U.S. retreat on geopolitical and economic challenges, which is basically a polite way of saying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/trumps-tariff-threat-now-targets-samsung-and-your-favorite-smartphones">U.S. tariffs made things too expensive to be worth it</a>. Higher costs, thinner profits, and the market just wasn’t working in its favor.</p><p>The U.S. smartphone market is a tough battleground, dominated by big players like Apple and Samsung. HMD struggled to gain traction with carriers and consumers, despite Nokia’s nostalgic appeal. Meanwhile, the company may be refocusing on markets where budget and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phones</a> sell better.</p><p>Last year, it began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nokia-no-more-hmd-global-shifts-gears">moving away from the Nokia brand</a> to focus on creating original devices and building new partnerships.</p><p>To be clear, HMD is not closing shop. Right now, it is focused on making sure the exit doesn’t leave customers or partners hanging. Warranties, support, and service are still on the table, backed by its global teams.</p><p>HMD took over Nokia’s feature phone business from Microsoft back in 2016, after Microsoft had its own go at reviving the brand in 2014. At the same time, HMD scored a deal to use the Nokia name on budget and mid-range phones and tablets. That licensing deal runs until March 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But <em>should</em> you upgrade to the Galaxy Watch 8, or should you hold off for the Galaxy Watch 9?</p><p>As the person who reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 and 6 Classic</a>, owns the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a>, reviewed the first-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, and is currently testing the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, I feel more than qualified to answer the question!</p><p>I'll talk about the polarizing Ultra-fication of the Watch 8 lineup, something my colleague Andrew discussed in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 8 hands-on</a>. But whatever your tastes, upgraded specs and new Samsung Health features should matter just as much as design.</p><p>Here's the gist, if you're in a hurry: Galaxy Watch 7 owners have only one tentative reason to upgrade, but with a Galaxy Watch 6 (Classic) or older, you should be seriously tempted.</p><h2 id="the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-isn-t-as-different-as-it-looks-2">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 isn't as different as it looks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="e2XQUEGeVYWuj3GdMkZRJG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2XQUEGeVYWuj3GdMkZRJG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 8 vs. 7</a>, it's immediately apparent how similar they are. They share the 3nm Exynos W1000 chip, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, dual-band GPS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity standards, and the latest BioActive Sensor suite with extra HR LEDs.</p><p>If you're switching from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Watch 6 to the Watch 8</a>, however, you do get a faster, more battery-efficient processor, dual-band GPS, more accurate health sensors with more data, faster charging, and doubled storage. Slightly more tempting, right?</p><p>Samsung slightly switched up its display sizes with the Watch 8: It measures 1.34 and 1.47 inches instead of 1.3 and 1.5, with a 326 pixels-per-inch ratio that's right in the usual ballpark. I doubt most people will notice that the display is different from previous years, aside from the extra brightness.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-11" alt="The Galaxy Watch 8 (left) and Watch 8 Classic (right)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Galaxy Watch 8 (<em>left</em>) and Watch 8 Classic (<em>right</em>) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 is 1.1mm skinnier than the Watch 7, or 2mm thinner than the Watch 8 Classic. So even if it looks thick in photos, it's the opposite because Samsung redesigned its internals to shrink things down.</p><p>The photos above and below show what the Galaxy Watch 8 looks like in person. Active-style Galaxy Watches have cases that hug the display edge so it feels like one seamless package; now, the bezelless display looks more isolated and elevated, and the squircle aluminum case stands out more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pryAeGXhZDXVRmSfCcJUXG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pryAeGXhZDXVRmSfCcJUXG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Personally, I've always found Galaxy Watches to be comfortable and functional, but fairly boring and far from a "normal" watch look. So I don't mind the Galaxy Watch 8 design experiment, because it switches things up after years of monotonous repetition.</p><p>Both the Watch 8 and 7 look artificial; the newer model just leans into this a bit more. Samsung superfans might dislike it, but since this squircle redesign is probably here to stay, you may want to try it out and see if you like it in person.</p><p>My colleague Andrew prefers the Watch 8 Classic look more and doesn't mind heavier watches, but he admitted that the Watch 8 is light enough to "forget" you're wearing it. With the default band attached, the Watch 8 40mm and 44mm will only weigh about 52–56g, very reasonable and comfortable for a smartwatch.</p><h2 id="no-other-smartwatch-looks-like-the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-except-the-ultra-2">No other smartwatch looks like the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (except the Ultra)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dWtbcgRrNYoq22gE4hH4vZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-close-up" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in a top-down view." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dWtbcgRrNYoq22gE4hH4vZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Galaxy Watch 6 Classic owners may feel conflicted about the Watch 8 Classic look, because the Ultra chic runs directly counter to the idea of a "classic" smartwatch design. But if you're strictly buying for the rotating bezel paired with two generations of upgrades, the Watch 8 Classic fits the bill nicely.</p><p>Where the Watch 8 display looks naked above the square-ish case, the Watch 8 Classic fills that gap with the zero-to-sixty scale border and the rotating bezel. From your top-down perspective wearing it, the Watch 8 Classic looks stylish and doesn't seem "unnatural."</p><p>To others, however, its flat sides may look bulky, calling attention to the fact that it's a smartwatch.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-display" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the default watch face, display border, and rotating bezel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2766" height="1556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="m5SWPtuvZkHymD45EFs36a" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-quick-button" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic sitting on top of an ornamental gold bowl, the right side with three buttons showing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m5SWPtuvZkHymD45EFs36a.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PWL6aEAvifsKmW9YPQfxzZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-side-view" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on the left side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWL6aEAvifsKmW9YPQfxzZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>You may be rightly concerned that the extra steel casing makes the Watch 8 Classic overly heavy. In practice, both my Watch 8 Classic 46mm and Watch 6 Classic 47mm weigh 86g or 3oz. And the newer model is 0.3mm thinner, though you can barely tell the difference in person.</p><p>The bulk <em>does</em> have an impact, because Samsung gave its Watch 8 Classic a smaller 1.34-inch display; there's no 1.5-inch option this time because (presumably) it would be <em>way</em> too heavy. You'll have to accept that visual downgrade, though you get an extra 1,000 nits of brightness, the Quick Button, 64GB of storage, and the other Watch 8 upgrades as consolation.</p><p>It's clear that Samsung made the Classic a more affordable spin-off of the Ultra, without the benefit of an extra day of battery life. It's too heavy for casual smartwatch fans, but those willing to wear a heavier watch might want the Ultra, or a cheaper, long-lasting option like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, long-time Classic fans will have to accept these changes for the rotating bezel, which feels just as seamless and natural to use as it did with the Watch 6 Classic.</p><h2 id="your-watch-8-upgrade-decision-will-come-down-to-samsung-health-2">Your Watch 8 upgrade decision will come down to Samsung Health </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results with Samsung Health on Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 launches with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> running One UI 8 Watch, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/samsung-announces-one-ui-8-watch-beta-program">major new health metrics</a>: carotene levels for your Antioxidant Index, heart health with Vascular Load, personalized training plans with Running Coach, and circadian rhythm for Bedtime Guidance.</p><p>I assumed that because the Watch 8 and 7 share the same health sensor suite, the Watch 7 would track all of this data once it got the update in a few months.

To me, it depends on whether these features are accurate enough to live up to Samsung's hype, and that's something I'll be testing and posting about on Android Central over the next couple of weeks.

As with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it feels like Samsung has something to prove with the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and its bold yet familiar design shows us that it does listen to consumers… at least somewhat.</p><p>There's certainly a lot to like about the Galaxy Z Flip 7, but there are some big question marks. This includes the move to another chipset despite Samsung's other phones this year using the latest from Qualcomm, as well as Samsung's insistence on not following Motorola's footsteps with regard to exactly how that newly expanded cover screen is handled.</p><p>So, should you buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>? Should you opt for the cheaper Galaxy Z Flip FE or maybe even last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>?

However, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 still doesn't let you use apps on the cover screen out of the box. As noted by Andrew Myrick in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">hands-on</a>, Samsung still keeps this functionality behind the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">MultiStar module in Good Lock</a>, meaning users will have to do a bit of extra work to enable this.</p><p>We haven't had a chance to see if there are any improvements to the overall experience, but this already doesn't bode well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Tg6AxfFftiir4PJqXAv866" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-25" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Now Brief hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tg6AxfFftiir4PJqXAv866.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, using apps on the cover screen is very handy, but it's not the be-all end-all of the entire Galaxy Z Flip 7 experience.

The Razr Ultra 2025, for example, doesn't seem to hit awe-inspiring benchmarking numbers compared to other 8 Elite devices, despite the phone performing very well in daily use. The compact Z Flip 7 may not require all that power, and Samsung may be more interested in efficiency than anything else.</p><p>I should note that I don't put much stock in benchmarking and instead rely solely on my experience using devices. The Razr Ultra 2025 can handle just about anything I throw at it, but I can't help but wonder if all that power is why Motorola stuffed a 4,700mAh battery into it. Meanwhile, Samsung seems content with a 4,300mAh battery for the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and given the difference in how these two chips are configured, I imagine Samsung is able to etch out more battery life with less.</p><p>Of course, time will tell how the chip will perform, and you'll have to wait for our review for more details.</p><h2 id="verdict-who-should-buy-this-phone-2">Verdict: Who should buy this phone?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 in Blue Shadow hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tDfz8STyLsNiQN2JhuyW26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 feels like a huge step in the right direction for Samsung. The improved design and larger cover screen make this a much more competitive flip phone, which should make Motorola nervous. That said, the jury is still out on whether the Exynos 2500 will shine or fall flat when compared to the competition.</p><p>The lower price tag is one of the advantages the Galaxy Z Flip 7 has over the Razr Ultra 2025. You can get it in a lower storage configuration than what Motorola offers, saving you about $200. Even at 512GB, it's still cheaper than Motorola's flagship, although that's with less RAM.</p><p>Overall, I think that almost anyone interested in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 should consider buying one, especially if you're coming from anything older than the Galaxy Z Flip 6. If you do have last year's model, you might wanna hold off upgrading, as the differences aren't as drastic.

July 11, 2005, is regarded by many as the official date when the Android team relocated to the Google campus and became part of the Google team.</p><p>Initially, Android Inc. was developing an operating system for digital cameras, but Google quickly pivoted its focus towards the burgeoning smartphone market, recognizing the immense potential. This acquisition laid the foundation for Google's entry into mobile software, setting the stage for a revolution.</p><p>The first commercially available Android device, the HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1), launched in October 2008. At this time, smartphones were still a niche, dominated by BlackBerry. Early Android phones were characterized by physical keyboards, small resistive touchscreens (typically around 3.2 inches), and a focus on basic internet browsing, email, and communication. Consumer needs were relatively simple: a reliable device for calls, texts, some basic web access, and a handful of apps.</p><p>Android's open-source nature quickly attracted developers, leading to a rapid expansion of the app ecosystem. By the early 2010s, Android had begun its meteoric rise, with devices like the Motorola Droid and Samsung Galaxy S series pushing touchscreen-only designs and incrementally larger displays (around 4-5 inches), signing the death certificate for physical keyboards.</p><h2 id="growing-pains-2015-2017-refinement-and-the-rise-of-the-big-screen-2">Growing pains (2015-2017): Refinement and the rise of the big screen</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qsuQSb7ouMb2R6KiKUSYFR" name="htc-one-nexus-4-04.jpg" alt="LG Nexus 4 versus HTC One." src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qsuQSb7ouMb2R6KiKUSYFR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>By 2015, Android was a <em>mostly</em> mature and dominant platform, having surpassed its competitors in market share. Devices were becoming sleeker, and screen sizes had settled into a comfortable range, typically between 5 and 5.5 inches. The "phablet" category, once a novelty, was starting to influence mainstream design, with devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-6p-specs">Nexus 6P</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-note-review">Galaxy Note</a> series pushing the upper limits. Consumer needs at this time revolved around reliable app performance, improved battery life, and access to a rapidly expanding and increasingly sophisticated app ecosystem for communication, social media, entertainment, and basic productivity.</p><p>Android's strength continued to be its open-source nature, fostering diverse hardware options from numerous manufacturers, which in turn catered to a wide range of budgets and preferences.</p><p>This period saw the solidification of core Android features, the refinement of Material Design for a more cohesive user interface, and significant improvements in camera technology. As users consumed more media, played more graphically intensive games, and engaged with more complex apps, the desire for slightly larger and more vibrant viewing areas began to subtly emerge, pushing screen sizes incrementally upwards and setting the stage for the next wave of innovation.</p><h2 id="the-era-of-edge-to-edge-displays-2018-2020-maximizing-screen-real-estate-2">The era of edge-to-edge displays (2018-2020): Maximizing screen real estate</h2><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="F6G2N7CAH334QDScAfamr4" name="google-pixel-3-xl-white-4.jpg" alt="Pixel 3 XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F6G2N7CAH334QDScAfamr4.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The years between 2018 and 2020 marked a pivotal shift towards truly expansive, edge-to-edge screens. Manufacturers, driven by consumer demand for more immersive content consumption and enhanced multitasking capabilities, began to minimize bezels aggressively. Innovations like the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-notch-add-screen-space-or-take-it-away">notch</a>," "punch-hole," and later under-display camera designs became common, pushing displays closer to the very edges of the device.</p><p>Screens grew significantly, with 6-inch and even 6.5-inch displays becoming standard, often in taller, narrower aspect ratios that made them more comfortable to hold despite their increased diagonal size.</p><p>Consumer needs evolved beyond basic functionality.

The larger, more immersive screens facilitated better split-screen multitasking and provided a superior canvas for media, gaming, and productivity apps, cementing the idea that a bigger display offered a more premium and functional experience.</p><p>This period also saw a greater emphasis on software updates, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-important-are-android-security-patches">security patches</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-io-privacy-location-data-collection">privacy controls</a>, as smartphones became increasingly central to users' personal and professional lives.</p><h2 id="the-foldable-frontier-2021-present-a-new-form-factor-2">The foldable frontier (2021-Present): A new form factor</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PTZZY2kKG6QR9StcMURpS7" name="podcast-addict-android-central-podcast-z-fold-3-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Podcast Addict app playing Android Central podcast on a Galaxy Z Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PTZZY2kKG6QR9StcMURpS7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most radical change in Android's recent history has been the introduction and maturation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>, beginning around 2019 but gaining significant traction and refinement from 2021 onwards. Devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/dont-want-to-spend-usd2k-on-the-fold-7-get-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-for-almost-40-percent-off-instead">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Z Flip</a> series, along with offerings from other manufacturers such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google's Pixel Fold</a>, shattered the traditional smartphone form factor. These devices directly addressed the desire for even larger screen real estate, offering a tablet-sized display when unfolded, while maintaining a pocketable form factor when closed.</p><p>This innovation necessitated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-is-google-getting-serious-about-foldables">significant adaptations within Android itself</a>. Google introduced specific optimizations for large screens, improved app continuity (seamless transitions between folded and unfolded states), and enhanced multitasking features tailored for the expansive inner displays, including better drag-and-drop and multi-window support. Consumer needs now include not just a large screen, but a versatile screen that can adapt to different use cases – from a compact phone to a mini-tablet, and even a laptop-like experience with external accessories.</p><p>Beyond foldables, the trend of large screens continued in traditional slab phones, with premium models routinely sporting displays well over 6.7 inches, often with high refresh rates for smoother scrolling and animations. Privacy and security have also become paramount consumer concerns, leading to more granular permission controls and transparency features within Android.</p><p>The platform continues to evolve, focusing on seamless connectivity, deeper integration with other devices (like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables">wearables</a> and smart home devices), and a more personalized, intelligent user experience, all while pushing the boundaries of hardware innovation with the foldable form factor leading the charge.</p><h2 id="evolving-android-2">Evolving Android</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4146px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iowDZd4ev9eQV6gdinVrbK" name="Android" alt="The Android sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iowDZd4ev9eQV6gdinVrbK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4146" height="2332" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since Google's foresightful acquisition of Android Inc. in 2005, the Android ecosystem has undergone a remarkable and ongoing transformation.

Nowadays, things have mostly calmed down, with Amazon, Apple, Google, and Roku leading the charge. Last year, Google shifted its focus, as it introduced the Google TV Streamer 4K, while also retiring the beloved Chromecast line.</p><p>Now, the Google TV Streamer sits atop the mountain in Google's ecosystem, operating as both a smart home hub and an excellent 4K streaming device. It wasn't really something that I expected to be part of the Prime Day festivities, but as it turns out, it's actually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Streamer-Streaming-Entertainment-Porcelain/dp/B0D8WJYSF9/"><strong>$15 off over at Amazon</strong></a>.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fprimeday%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9645927358031349343-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><em><strong>Prime Day 2025 ends tonight!

Google thankfully rectified that with the TV Streamer, as it includes 32GB of storage. And if that isn't enough, you can connect a USB-C hub and a thumb drive to expand it even further.</p><p>There are also a few AI features on board, but they aren't really intrusive and are more novelty than anything else. However, the biggest reason why I love the TV Streamer is that it can basically turn my TV into a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-display">massive smart display</a>.</p><p>Google integrated both Matter and a Thread Border Router into the TV Streamer, ensuring that it would be compatible with just about any smart home ecosystem. Of course, it works best when you use the Google Home app, but if you take the time to set up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/this-one-app-has-made-my-life-so-much-easier">Home Assistant</a>, you can connect and control all of your smart home devices right from the Google Home app.</p><p>I'm not sure what the future holds for the Google TV Streamer, but it's still performing well enough that it's not something I've even thought about.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-7">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4573639154595610853-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></u></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1212356707565852129-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-9376992827335726461-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1233177422277781313-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-4012941798439036658-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide.</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Even though Prime Day ends at midnight on July 11, some deals will persist on competing sites like Best Buy through the weekend, and one cheap (for Garmin) deal that's currently still available is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/garmin-venu-sq-2-gps-smartwatch-40mm-fiber-reinforced-polymer-slate-2022/6517040.p?skuId=6517040"><strong>Garmin Venu Sq 2 at $149 ($100 off) at Best Buy</strong></a>.</p><p>We called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-sq-2-review">Garmin Venu Sq 2</a> the "Goldilocks smartwatch" in our original review because of how it struck a nice balance between smarts and fitness. Since then, Garmin watches have gotten smarter, but also more expensive; I'd love to recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-x1-bizarre-premium-watch-stuck-between-two-worlds">Venu X1</a>, but they're just too dang expensive for an impulse buy to try out the brand.</p><p>That's why I'm recommending the Venu Sq 2 as an affordable gateway into the world of Garmin, to see if you can change your lifestyle and become more fit with a little help, while also benefiting from perks like an 11-day battery life, all-systems GNSS tracking, and a 1.4-inch AMOLED display.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1cd4efa2-456e-408e-8eb3-30a2eb870a1d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Garmin Venu Sq 2 still holds up as an intriguing entry-level option to the brand.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Every time I go on vacation, I haul out my collection of Blink Mini Pan-Tilt cameras and set them up around my house. Each plugs into an outlet with a tiny power brick that fits anywhere, and thanks to the diminutive size, the PTZ camera also fits on any shelf or dresser.</p><p>Since it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-Pan-Tilt-Camera-White/dp/B09N6YCT3Y/"><strong>just $23</strong></a> for the rest of the day today, July 11, I can grab a few more to ensure I see every nook and cranny of my home while I'm away. That's $23 out the door, no subscription needed or strings to pull, and no garbage or hassles, and no worrying about someone spying on me since I only set them up when I'm away.</p><p>If you've got any other Blink cameras, these will tie right in with them in the Blink app, letting you monitor everything from one handy dashboard. Blink cameras don't require a subscription to work, and you can even pick up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Sync-Module-2/dp/B084RQ6MHJ">Blink Sync Module</a> to configure local storage on an SD card.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ffc90257-7011-43ec-9d72-4f83dc0c7612" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension48="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension25="$23.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-Pan-Tilt-Camera-White/dp/B09N6YCT3Y/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="uApUTnYB7nq2dT8wwMyFid" name="blink-mini-pan-tilt-official-product-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uApUTnYB7nq2dT8wwMyFid.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>There's no getting around it. For the price, it's nearly impossible to argue with what Blink offers. Great camera quality, a wider range of movement than Ring, a quick 360-degree pan button to scope out the whole room, and the ability to store footage locally or in the cloud. </p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/blink-ptz-vs-ring-ptz-cameras-which-amazon-brand-should-see-your-home" data-dimension112="ffc90257-7011-43ec-9d72-4f83dc0c7612" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension48="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension25="$23.99"><strong>Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison </strong></a>📷</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for an amazing indoor PTZ camera that has a full 360-degree range of movement, 135-degree tilt range, motion detection, and even a two-way speaker so you can hear what's going on in your house and speak to whoever is there, invited or not!</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a camera with 4K resolution, AI-powered object detection, or something more advanced. This camera does a lot, but more expensive models will get you more options.</p><p><strong>Alternative deal ⭐:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-Pan-Tilt-Camera-White/dp/B09N6YCT3Y/"><strong>Ring Pan-Tilt camera - </strong><del>$79.99</del><strong> $39.99 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-Pan-Tilt-Camera-White/dp/B09N6YCT3Y/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ffc90257-7011-43ec-9d72-4f83dc0c7612" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension48="Ring PTZ vs Blink PTZ: see why Blink wins in our comparison" data-dimension25="$23.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>As I've said in the past, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/never-ever-put-a-camera-inside-your-home">I never recommend</a> leaving cameras set up in your home while you're in it. It's a horrible security risk if anyone ever gains access to your account, but these cameras are so small and so easy to set up that it's never a hassle to pull them out when I want to use them.</p><p>It's worth noting that this camera is only designed for indoor use. It's not weather-rated at all, so it's definitely going to break if it gets soaked in a rainstorm or baked in the summer heat. Blink sells other cameras that are made for outdoor use. I actually have several of them in my chicken coop, and they do a great job of monitoring the temperature there and in the outdoor rabbit hutch we have.</p><p>Overall, I love Blink and use it for almost all my smart home cameras. It's especially handy that I can keep the footage on local SD cards and not have to pay for cloud storage, although that option is great for people who would rather skip the hassle of dealing with swapping out SD cards or changing video sources.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The fact of the matter is, investing a tiny bit of cash into a stellar charging ecosystem can result in big quality-of-life improvements. If you don't have quality chargers and cables, you're probably not making the most of your flagship tech products.</p><p>Luckily, as Amazon Prime Day winds down, there are still deals that let you build out a fantastic charging portfolio on a budget. I've put together a list of four Anker products that'll help you do just that. Some are priced <strong>as low as under $6</strong>, while the most expensive charger in this roundup is <strong>only $17.99</strong>.</p><p>If you're someone that rolls their eyes at buying new chargers or hates overpaying for unnecessary junk, this is the practical list of Prime Day charging deals you need to jump on — all from popular charging brand Anker.</p><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-8764089166276989524-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Amazon Prime Day is ENDING today!

If the wall adapter plugging into your outlet doesn't support a fast charging speed, nothing else matters. The Anker Nano 3 can deliver 30W fast charging, and considering its small size, that's wildly impressive. Foldable wall prongs mean you can easily throw the Nano 3 in a bag or pocket without issue.</p><p>I've been using Anker Nano chargers for years, and have convinced a few friends and family members to switch to them. After they gave Anker Nano a shot, they didn't want to use any other wall charger. You can pick one up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">only $12 on Prime Day.</a></p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="43b5d6e6-2560-46e2-bd60-2d5bf12c0f07" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker Nano 3:  $19.99" data-dimension48="Anker Nano 3:  $19.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="7HiXjadHykh6wMgScDbGBE" name="Anker 511 Nano 3 USB C GaN Charger 30W.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7HiXjadHykh6wMgScDbGBE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="1066" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Anker Nano 3: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="43b5d6e6-2560-46e2-bd60-2d5bf12c0f07" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker Nano 3:  $19.99" data-dimension48="Anker Nano 3:  $19.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$19.99</del> <strong>$12.29 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Anker Nano 3 should be the default USB-C wall adapter.

They're durable and support 60W fast charging speeds — enough to make the most of the Anker Nano 3 charger and future upgrades.</p><p>You can get two, three-foot-long USB-C to USB-C cables for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Charge-Samsung-MacBook/dp/B0BPC6TTNX/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">under $6 on Prime Day.</a> That's less than $3 per cable, which is honestly insane.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="ba11e642-2ea4-4e6e-9069-e72bf0a0a28c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (2PK):  $7.99" data-dimension48="Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (2PK):  $7.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Charge-Samsung-MacBook/dp/B0BPC6TTNX/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="eTpve6bvRjsiRc5PfPym5g" name="Anker-USBC-Cable-2pk" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eTpve6bvRjsiRc5PfPym5g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (2PK): </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Charge-Samsung-MacBook/dp/B0BPC6TTNX/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored" data-dimension112="ba11e642-2ea4-4e6e-9069-e72bf0a0a28c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (2PK):  $7.99" data-dimension48="Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (2PK):  $7.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$7.99</del> <strong>$5.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>After double-checking the price, I can confirm it's real: you can get TWO braided USB-C cables supporting 60W charging for only $6.

This isn't some back alley deal, it's just the best smartphone deal you'll find today since it's so darn cheap. And yeah, I have four of them. Don't judge me.</p><p>The Nuu N20 is a surprisingly capable phone that'll do all the basics and then some. It's a great choice for your kid's first phone, a vacation phone (so you don't have to worry about something more expensive getting stolen), or even just as a backup device to keep in a drawer.</p><p>This one ramped up in price in May because of the lovely tariff situation in the U.S. but it's back down to pre-tariff pricing until the end of the day today, Friday, July 11. That's the last day of Prime Day, if you hadn't heard!</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="cb6b0bc0-78b0-459c-9174-4a1c21d75fa9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Coral" data-dimension48="Coral" data-dimension25="$109" href="https://www.amazon.com/NUU-T-Mobile-Teenagers-Octa-Core-Unlocked/dp/B0DLG4WKKG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1432px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:104.75%;"><img id="ua5jKrVxHZ77XWbeQF5ugJ" name="nuun-20-product-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ua5jKrVxHZ77XWbeQF5ugJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1432" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Also check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLG5C7SD/" data-dimension112="cb6b0bc0-78b0-459c-9174-4a1c21d75fa9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Coral" data-dimension48="Coral" data-dimension25="$109"><strong>Coral</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLGHZ3YN/"><strong>Purple</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLGKWNMR/"><strong>Green</strong></a> colorways for the same price!</p><p>The Nuu N20 is a no-frills Android 14-powered phone that can download all your favorite apps from the Google Play Store and works perfectly with U.S. 4G networks like T-Mobile. Grab one for your kids, your next vacation, or just as a backup phone in case yours breaks.</p><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need a simple Android phone that can do all the basics — phone calls, messaging, downloading apps, taking pictures and video — but don't need anything high-powered or expensive. This one doesn't look or feel cheap, despite what you might assume!</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you have no interest in a cheap backup phone.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/NUU-T-Mobile-Teenagers-Octa-Core-Unlocked/dp/B0DLG4WKKG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="cb6b0bc0-78b0-459c-9174-4a1c21d75fa9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Coral" data-dimension48="Coral" data-dimension25="$109">View Deal</a></p></div><p>As you might imagine, the Nuu N20 isn't going to win any awards for best display, camera, or processing speed. But what it will win is the best Prime Day value award, because it gives you a full-fledged Android 14-powered experience without all the fluff that comes with other devices.</p><p>Nuu is based in Miami, Florida, and does an excellent job crafting a stock-like Android experience without the bloat or preinstalled nonsense that some other budget brands fill their phones with.</p><p>This one's got 6GB of RAM, which is 50% more than any Motorola phone at this price range, and the 90Hz display feels smoother than even the $1,000 iPhones. No, I'm dead serious there. The non-Pro iPhones use a paltry 60Hz screen, which feels just plain awful in 2025. Meanwhile, this $109 phone eclipses half of Apple's recent lineup in this one area. It's pretty wild.</p><p>Nuu also advertises that the N20 works perfectly with any parental control app, so you can keep your kids safe online. I personally use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bark.us/">Bark parental controls</a> for my son and love how it can catch even bad images that might appear on your child's phone, thanks to the "wonders" of the internet. Whatever you do with it, though, make sure you buy it before midnight tonight, otherwise this deal is gone.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is a phenomenal system with lots of upgrades over the original model, but some people are unhappy with the LCD screen on the system. While Nintendo doesn't sell an OLED-equipped model yet, you can get an OLED on the go when using a pair of smart glasses, but you'll need this clever battery pack to get the job done.</p><p>Thankfully, the Viture Pro Mobile Dock is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Compatible-PlayStation-Supports-Handheld/dp/B0D3LT6BJW"><strong>on sale for $98.10</strong></a> on the last day of Prime Day, which ends Friday, July 11. This 10,000mAh battery pack has a set of special USB-C ports that trick the Switch 2 into thinking it's docked to a TV, unlocking the full power of the system and making it possible to play it on a pair of OLED-equipped smart glasses. Not only that, but this supports <em>two</em> smart glasses at a time, so you and someone else can play at the same time with a giant virtual OLED.</p><p>See, with most handheld systems, you can just plug smart glasses into the USB-C port and your system thinks it's docked, but not the Switch 2. Nintendo locked down the USB-C port on this system just as with the original Switch, but Viture cleverly designed the Mobile Dock to work with Nintendo's security, making this the <em>only </em>way to play on a Switch 2 with smart glasses.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-ca-5457778577287776063-20" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vitures-new-luma-glasses-are-incredible-and-this-viture-prime-day-sale-is-impossible-to-resist"><strong>Viture's new Luma glasses are incredible, and this Viture Prime Day sale is impossible to resist</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="03daf6d7-3403-4322-88d2-8268e68c337a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central review" data-dimension48="Android Central review" data-dimension25="$98.10" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HWLY3T" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1425px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tUS3fEEJW9kcgoeZyj8NwR" name="viture-pro-mobile-dock-official-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tUS3fEEJW9kcgoeZyj8NwR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1425" height="1425" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Be sure to clip the </em><em><strong>10% off coupon</strong></em><em> on Amazon's page before checking out to get the full discount.</em></p><p>Plug the Viture Pro Mobile Dock into your Switch 2 and enjoy docked performance and quality on the go.

Trying out these glasses, and their embedded speakers, showed me how freeing it is to listen to music on-the-go without clogging up your ears. Enter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds" target="_blank">the best open-earbuds</a>, designed to provide a personal listening experience without the hassle.</p><p>Why might you want a pair of open earbuds? This style of audio gear might make sense if you're someone that has a hard time finding ear tips and buds that fit perfectly. Since the Bose Ultra Open earbuds sit outside your ear canal, this isn't a problem at all. They gently rest outside your ear canal while subtly clipping onto your earlobe for comfort and security.</p><p>The open design means you can also let ambient noise in, which can be desirable in a few kinds of situations. Maybe you're a runner or cyclist who needs to hear the world around you for a safe workout. Or, perhaps you work at a jobsite or office where it's necessary to hear what's going on nearby.</p><p>There are a few tradeoffs — without passive isolation, bass reproduction won't be at its best and you might need to crank the volume up in noisy environments. But for the right person, these are small sacrifices that become worthwhile to get the perfect fit. At the right price — under $200 at Best Buy for a limited time — the Bose Ultra Open earbuds are an excellent buy.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-32">Prime Day 2025 Android deals — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1247058908279972596-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is LIVE July 8-11: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1710879167675793923-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2723093340651576047-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dsmartwatches%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1324054839394922680-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 45% off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1144969634142208516-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

There are still great deals on high-end Apple and Android watches, but if you're bargain hunting in the final few hours, you're probably looking at much cheaper watches.

Rumors suggest we might see one pretty soon.</p><p>A render of a fancy-looking Motorola Razr was posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/exclusive-motorola-razr-swarovski-edition-is-launching-soon-first-look/">YTECHB</a> today (July 11), suggesting an incoming collaboration edition (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_is_working_on_a_blingedup_razr-news-68590.php">GSMArena</a>). The publication claims Motorola is preparing to bring a fancy new "crystal-studded" Razr 2025 foldable edition. From the rendering, the device looks mostly the same, save for the small crystals (kind of like diamonds) popped into its form factor.</p><p>On the cover display, there are supposedly three crystals implanted near the hinge, just above the screen. The back of the device is where the design is reportedly going to shine the most. It seems Motorola will implant crystal studs into a (seemingly) soft fabric material, which looks almost like a fancified purse.</p><p>Prominent X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1943538675964342466">Evan Blass</a> got in on things, stating this phone is looking at a debut on August 5; however, we might know who it's with. The tipster's post and the publication both claim Motorola is looking at Swarovski, a jewelry company, to bedazzle its foldable.</p><p>Moreover, it seems this collaboration edition will only concern the base Razr 2025 foldable. The rendering doubles down on this, furthered by the thicker border between the cover display and the hinge. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra</a> offers a slightly larger display (4-inch), so the border is much thinner on it.</p><h2 id="motorola-and-its-collabs-special-editions-2">Motorola and its collabs/special editions</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:591px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.49%;"><img id="7dpZ2q5aERYqm45FBGiMs8" name="motorola-razr-2025-swarovski-render-leak" alt="A leaked render of the Motorola Razr 2025 with a light blue color scheme for its rumored Swarovski jewelry collaboration." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7dpZ2q5aERYqm45FBGiMs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="591" height="588" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YTECHB)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The name Swarovski might sound familiar, and that's because Motorola collaborated with them once before (or you like their jewelry). Earlier this year, when the Razr 2025 series debuted, Motorola launched its first-ever open-earbuds, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-buds-loop-watch-fit-spotlight-details-launch">the Buds Loop</a>. These buds are offered with 12mm drivers for rich sound, and they come in the following colors: Pantone-curated Trekking Green and a dazzling Pantone-curated French Oak.</p><p>However, there was a third option: a crystal-encrusted version, thanks to Swarovski. These buds are lighter in color, and the crystals are present along the band that connects the two halves of the device for each ear. It seems Motorola was pleased with the first round, so it's looking into the collaboration again for its foldable phone.</p><p>Motorola has always been one for unique collaborations and special editions. Back in February, the company launched a special edition <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-paris-pink-limited-edition-launch">Razr Plus 2024 with Paris Hilton</a>. The device was offered in a new Paris Pink with a vegan leather finish, as well as two wrist straps in Pink Sparkle and Pink Vegan Leather. Consumers could also grab a vegan leather case that continues the Paris Pink trend with her signature and iconic phrase, "That's Hot."</p><p>On a more subtle note, the Razr Plus 2024 also received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-2024-razr-plus-pantone-rich-mocha-shade">a Mocha Mousse color</a> from Pantone late last year.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
