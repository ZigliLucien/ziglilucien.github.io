<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>About Code Club</strong></h2>



<p><a href="http://rpf.io/cc-homepage-pr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Club</a> is a thriving global community of clubs where young people can develop the confidence to create with digital technologies in a fun and supportive space. Code Clubs run in schools, libraries and other community settings. We have already supported 2 million school-aged young people worldwide to make things they care about with code.</p>



<p>We offer free training and ongoing support for anyone who would like to set up a Code Club — you don’t need to have a background in coding and technology to get involved.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Two teachers give their tips on setting up a Code Club</strong></h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“If you’re thinking of starting a Code Club, do it. The Code Club team has everything created — all the resources are available.” – Peter Hutyan, Code Club mentor, The Mease Spencer Academy, UK. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Peter, a primary school teacher, has been running a Code Club for seven years at The Mease Spencer Academy in Derby, UK.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Peter.png" alt="A man smiling. " class="wp-image-90859" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Peter.png 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Peter-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Peter-500x282.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Peter-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Peter-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Peter-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Peter-900x507.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>“When I started Code Club, I didn’t know how to do Scratch”, says Peter about the block-based coding tool that lots of young learners start with. “So I made myself learn how to use Scratch and I was two to three lessons ahead of the kids. Basically I’ve done what the kids will do — I’ve read the instructions and created the code. It’s such a phenomenal experience of enriching young people’s lives, and you see the smile and sense of accomplishment on their faces. It’s the best day ever.”</p>



<p>Rachael Coultart is the Computer Subject Leader at St Nicholas Primary School, Stevenage, UK and has run a Code Club for over ten years.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="719" height="405" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image__12__720.png" alt="A woman laughing. " class="wp-image-90860" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image__12__720.png 719w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image__12__720-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image__12__720-500x282.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image__12__720-450x253.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" /></figure></div>


<p>“I think the benefits of running a Code Club for our school are that it really develops children’s collaboration skills, really develops their perseverance, their thinking skills, their independence”, Rachael says.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The key ingredients that I think make a Code Club successful is enthusiasm, from the adults who are there, a kind of passion to learn together and make mistakes together. I kind of think that sets the scene for the children to make mistakes as well. And I think having that freedom outside the classroom is what makes a Code Club really successful.” – Rachael Coultart, Computing Subject Leader, St Nicholas Primary School, UK</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Club mentors share why they were inspired to start a club</strong></h2>



<p>Saad Koubeissi runs four Code Clubs in libraries in London, UK.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Saad-2.png" alt="A man smiling." class="wp-image-90864" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Saad-2.png 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Saad-2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Saad-2-500x282.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Saad-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Saad-2-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Saad-2-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Saad-2-900x507.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>“Code Club, for me personally, is about providing children with things I didn’t have when I was younger”, says Saad. “I went to youth clubs and stuff but it was never, like, so specific in tech, it was more, like, playing football. So Code Club, I think, by starting off early, it’s introducing children not only to identifying those skills, but also the terminologies, providing that. And being able to be part of that change for those children is welcome for me, to be honest.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bob Bisland is a mentor who started his first Code Club twelve years ago after a career in technology. He now runs three clubs in Malvern, UK.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Bob.png" alt="A man smiling." class="wp-image-90865" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Bob.png 1920w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Bob-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Bob-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Bob-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Bob-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Bob-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Bob-450x253.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure></div>


<p>“Everyone should set up a Code Club. This is such a rewarding thing to be able to do. I am sharing my passion and my knowledge with another generation of children, and I&#8217;m seeing them learn what coding is all about.”</p>

<p>Here at the Raspberry Pi Foundation we believe ensuring every child knows how to code will equip them with the skills to thrive in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what do we mean by coding and how can you get started?</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="692" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/CodeClub_CamMS_24-041.jpg" alt="Two young coders at a Code Club." class="wp-image-90826" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/CodeClub_CamMS_24-041.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/CodeClub_CamMS_24-041-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/CodeClub_CamMS_24-041-500x346.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/CodeClub_CamMS_24-041-768x531.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/CodeClub_CamMS_24-041-800x554.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/CodeClub_CamMS_24-041-450x311.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/CodeClub_CamMS_24-041-900x623.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/CodeClub_CamMS_24-041-216x150.jpg 216w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>Coding is how humans give instructions to computers. Machines process and execute these instructions to perform the task you want — whether it’s making an LED light flash, designing your own avatar and making it dance, or creating a website.</p>



<p>Coding underpins the digital technologies that are ubiquitous in our daily lives: the apps on your phone, the software in your TV, and in life-saving devices in hospitals — even making sure your supermarket is fully stocked.</p>



<p>By learning to code, young people can develop the skills and knowledge that we need in an increasingly digital world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>So how can you get started?</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Code Club</strong></h3>



<p>One of the best ways for school-aged young people to get started with coding is to find your local <a href="http://rpf.io/cc-homepage-pr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Club</a> — a fun and supportive space where young people develop the skills and confidence to create with digital technologies. They might program their first-ever game or animation in Scratch, create their own step counter with a micro:bit, or use Python to control a robot!</p>



<p>There are around 2,000 Code Clubs across the UK and Ireland and nearly 6,000 more around the world, running in schools and communities – and they are totally free! As well as learning to code, young creators work together, gain confidence and a sense of belonging, and build their skills in problem solving and teamwork. You can read more about the benefits in this <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/how-fun-filled-code-clubs-drive-learning-new-evidence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">independent evaluation of Code Club</a>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Creators use our free, <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">step-by-step projects</a> to learn different coding languages and skills. We have hundreds of free coding and computing projects for all experience levels and interests. For example, young people can start to code to make a character catch a bus, then move on to building a musical instrument, and even try out creating a project that uses artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>This handy <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/321-make-mentor-guide/9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide for mentors</a> will help you find which projects are right for you and your creators. Read on to find out more about our free coding resources.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Scratch&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scratch</a> is a good way for young people to begin their journey in coding. Scratch is a block-based language, which allows children to assemble code to produce games, animations, and stories.</p>



<p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation has hundreds of Scratch projects that young creators can try out, but the best place to start is with our <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/scratch-intro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Introduction to Scratch</a> path. This will provide young people with the basic skills they need, and then encourage them to build projects that are relevant to them, culminating in their creation of their own interactive ebook.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="480" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/codeclub_camms_24-008__1__720.jpg" alt="A mentor and a young person at a Code Club." class="wp-image-90830" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/codeclub_camms_24-008__1__720.jpg 720w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/codeclub_camms_24-008__1__720-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/codeclub_camms_24-008__1__720-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/codeclub_camms_24-008__1__720-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Web design</strong></h3>



<p>Websites are integral to many of our lives, and we believe that it is important for young people to learn how the websites and apps they visit are created with code.</p>



<p>That is why we have an <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/web-intro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Introduction to web development</a> path that enables young creators to make their own simple webpages and apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and share them with their friends. The path helps them create webpages about subjects that they care about, and they also learn about accessible web design.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Python</strong></h3>



<p>Once children feel confident using Scratch, Python is a brilliant next step. It’s a real-world programming language used by professionals, but it’s also simple enough for beginners. Python helps young people move from blocks to text-based code, deepening their understanding of how programming works. It’s easy to read, which means learners can focus on thinking logically and building exciting projects. Our<a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/python-intro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Python path for beginners</a> is the perfect place to start, and we have loads more <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=python" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python projects</a> for them to explore as their skills grow.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong></h3>



<p>Our new <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artificial intelligence (AI) path</a> allows young people to discover the foundational concepts of machine learning through creative and interactive projects using AI applications and technologies. Working with voice recognition, facial recognition, and other AI technologies, young people gain a broader understanding of how AI can be applied in different contexts.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Physical computing with Raspberry Pi</strong></h3>



<p>For young creators interested in interacting with the real world using code, our <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/physical_computing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physical computing</a> projects help them discover how to use electronic components. These projects show how to build things with buttons, switches, buzzers and LEDs using <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/physical-computing-with-scratch-and-the-raspberry-pi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scratch and a Raspberry Pi computer</a>, or using <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/pico-intro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python and a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Physical computing with micro:bit</strong></h3>



<p>Another fun option for young people who want to explore physical computing is the <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/microbit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">micro:bit</a>. This is a small programmable device with an LED display, buttons, and sensors, and it can be used to create games, animations, interactive projects, and lots more. A visual programming language called <a href="https://makecode.microbit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MakeCode</a> can be used to control a micro:bit. Or the micro:bit can be programmed using Scratch or text-based languages such as Python, offering an easy transition for young creators as their coding skills progress. Have a look at our free <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?hardware%5B%5D=microbit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collection of micro:bit resources</a> to learn more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>



<p>When young people are confident in these areas, they could try creating and exploring 3D worlds with the power of <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/unity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unity</a>. And what about creating using a Raspberry Pi computer?<strong> </strong>These <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/raspberry_pi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beginner projects</a> help you learn to set up and configure your Raspberry Pi and get started.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fancy running your code in space or submitting your project to our showcase?</strong></h2>



<p>Once you’re up and running, we have two fun ways kids can get even more out of coding.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://astro-pi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Astro Pi Challenge</a> allows kids to run their code in space. We have two levels:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Mission Zero, suitable for beginners, where they code a personalised image for the astronauts on the International Space Station</li>



<li>Mission Space Lab, where kids&#8217; code solves a scientific task on board the International Space Station</li>
</ul>



<p>And young people can also submit their creations to <a href="https://online.coolestprojects.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coolest Projects</a>. This is a celebration of young digital creators and the amazing things they make with technology. We have a global online showcase, as well as in-person Coolest Projects events in several countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you’ve been inspired to set up a new Code Club, or volunteer at a Code Club near you, <a href="http://rpf.io/cc-run-club-pr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find out the next steps here</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, <a href="http://rpf.io/cc-homepage-pr">Code Club</a> has provided more than 2 million young people with the opportunity to learn how to build their own apps, games, animations, websites, robots, and so much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know that getting hands-on, practical experience of building real projects with technology works. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/how-fun-filled-code-clubs-drive-learning-new-evidence/">Independent evaluations</a> have shown that attending a Code Club not only helps young people develop their programming skills, but also builds wider life skills such as confidence, resilience, problem-solving, and communication. All of which we know are essential if they are going to thrive in a world where AI is ubiquitous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, there are over 2,000 Code Clubs meeting in schools and libraries all over the UK, organised by an amazing community of teachers, educators, and volunteers from all walks of life. We want to see that number grow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t need technical skills to mentor at a Code Club. The Raspberry Pi Foundation provides free, self-guided projects that help young people learn how to create with different technologies. We have over 200 <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/">Code Club Projects</a> on our website, all of which are developed by expert educators, based on evidence of how young people learn, and rigorously tested; so we know that they are effective.</p>



<p>That includes <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/artificial_intelligence">a set of projects</a> that support the safe exploration of AI technologies, helping young people understand how AI works, its possibilities and limitations.</p>

<p>We also provide training and support to help you set up and run your Code Club, all of which is available at no charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I can promise you that the hour you spend in a Code Club will be the highlight of your week. I always come away from Code Club inspired and optimistic about what young people can achieve if we give them a sense of agency over technology.</p>

<p>If you have been inspired to set up your own Code Club, you can find <a href="http://rpf.io/cc-run-club-pr">all the information you need to run your own club here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You don&#8217;t have to take my word for it: here&#8217;s Janine, a Computer Science teacher and long-time Code Club mentor from Stoke-on-Trent sharing her experience.</p>



<p><em>Janine Kirk is a Computer Science Teacher at The King’s Church of England Academy in Stoke-on-Trent, UK, who has been running a Code Club for over ten years. She has been inspired by the campaign for a Code Club in every school and library in the UK, to set up clubs in six other schools in her multi-academy trust.</em></p>

<p>Setting up a Code Club is really easy as a teacher, as you can just tag it onto the end of your school day, or during lunch. The website is clear and easy to use — and once you have signed up, you have access to additional resources to promote your club. Code Club gives time and space to explore coding in a completely different way than in a classroom. For me, it’s about seeing what programs really inspire students: it gives an insight into how students like to code, ideas of preferred coding language, and tasks they keep coming back to. Running a Code Club has also allowed me to build relationships with students outside of the classroom environment, and all of this spills into my lessons and improves my teaching practice.</p>

<p>For students, Code Club is a great space where they can collaborate and work on their chosen tasks. Students often comment on how they look forward to Code Club and how they have continued their projects at home. It also allows students much more variety in enrichment activity, as Code Club is often popular with students who are neurodivergent. It’s amazing to see the children grow in confidence and friendship as they find likeminded students to support each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My students really love the certificates they can earn. We have been inspired by the excellent activities that revamp the old ways of teaching programming and give them a really nice spin. In fact, I have used the resources in computer science lessons too, as they are often much more visual and fun for the students to create.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since joining Code Club I have felt part of a community. I receive regular updates, and attending events such as the <a href="http://rpf.io/cc-clubscon-pr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clubs Conference</a> really helps inspire creative ways to teach coding. As a computing teacher in a secondary school, you are often part of a very small team — but Code Club has allowed me to feel part of something bigger, and I know that should I need support, they are always there with friendly advice. It really is the best thing that I have done in my career.</p>

<p>Coolest Projects is an annual global showcase for young people who love to make things with technology, whether it’s a clever Scratch game, a hardware hack, or an app that solves a real-world problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2025, we introduced a brand new AI category, supported by Amazon Future Engineer and Allianz, which drew over 100 impressive entries, covering everything from mood-sensing AI tools to jellyfish vs plastic bag image classifiers.</p>



<p>Last week, we celebrated all of these brilliant makers in a special livestream event. As always, a panel of VIP judges selected a few standout creations to highlight this year. You can catch up on the livestream here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Experience CS is a brand-new, free, integrated computer science curriculum for elementary and middle school educators and anyone working with students aged 8 to 14. A key design principle for Experience CS is that any educator can use it. You don’t need a computer science qualification or previous experience in teaching computer science classes to deliver engaging and creative learning experiences for your students. That’s why, as US Executive Director, I’m especially pleased to announce the launch of the first six units in the curriculum today.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="628" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-10.png" alt="A vibrant yellow background with the text &quot;Introducing Experience CS&quot; centered.

<p>Read on to explore the new learning materials available and how you can start using them in your school.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Six integrated computer science units&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Experience CS enables educators to teach computer science through a curriculum that integrates CS concepts and knowledge into core subjects such as math, science, and social studies. Ashly Tritch, computer science immersion specialist at Olson Middle School in Bloomington, MN, USA, said, “Cross-curricular computer science is important because it shows students how coding and tech skills can be used in other subjects like math, science, or even art. It helps make learning more interesting and helps kids understand how computer science connects to real life. The lessons that the Raspberry Pi Foundation is creating will be super engaging, with fun and creative activities that keep students curious and excited to learn.”</p>



<p>Six <a href="https://experience-cs.org/units" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">integrated computer science units</a> are available to access, with more on the way. The units have been released in beta, and we would <a href="https://rpf.io/experience-cs-feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">love to hear your feedback</a> as we continue to make updates to the lesson materials. Each of the units includes an overview with a summary of the topics covered and a series of six to eight lessons, including lesson plans, slide decks, student-facing materials, and starter projects within our Code Editor for Education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have designed the units to be cross-curricular, so students can learn about computer science concepts while deepening their understanding of related subject area content. For example, in “<a href="https://experience-cs.org/units/the-me-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The me project</a>,” grade 4 students (ages 9–10) explore the basics of Scratch, personalise sprites, and develop programs to create an animation that tells a story all about them. The project could be integrated into language arts lessons, enabling young learners to explore visual representation and write their own unique stories. In the “<a href="https://experience-cs.org/units/smart-communities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smart communities</a>” unit, students in grade 6 (ages 11–12) explore ways in which computing and technology can be used to create environments that are responsive to the needs of community members; this could be included within science or technology lessons.</p>

<p>Initially, the curriculum and resources have been mapped to national and local standards in the US and Canada, including the K–12 Computer Science Teachers Association Standards for Students, but they are available for teachers and students anywhere in the world to use.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://experience-cs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">register for a free Raspberry Pi Foundation account</a> to start downloading the learning materials, including lesson plans, slide decks, student activity sheets and assessment criteria. </p>

<p>Experience CS has been built from the ground up to support safe, confident computing lessons in real classrooms. It includes self-directed creative projects using the popular programming language Scratch. We have <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-cs-a-safe-creative-way-to-teach-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built a version of Scratch that is especially for schools</a>. That means it doesn’t have the community and sharing features that are central to the full Scratch platform. Instead, everything runs in a closed, classroom-ready environment that supports safeguarding policies and fits with school filtering systems. Simple and intuitive learning management features enable teachers to create accounts, set assignments, and review progress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to get started&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>On the &#8220;<a href="http://experience-cs.org/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Getting Started</a>&#8221; page, teachers will find everything they need, including helpful videos and tutorials. The <a href="https://form.raspberrypi.org/4874038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next webinar</a> takes place on 16th July, where we will walk you through all six units available at launch and show you how easy it is to get started with the learning materials. Whether you&#8217;re a CS teacher, general education teacher, administrator, or someone who works with school-aged young people, this session will give you the practical tools and guidance you need to bring Experience CS to life in your classroom or program.</p>

<p>Young people everywhere deserve a high-quality computing education. But what a high-quality computing education looks like differs depending on a learner’s culture, context, and the existing provision in the country they live in. Therefore, adapting our educational resources for a range of contexts is a key part of our work at the Raspberry Pi Foundation, for example when we collaborate with partners to localise our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Computing Curriculum</a> resources.</p>

<p>In this blog post, we share our experiences of adapting curriculum resources with our partners in Kenya, and the impact of this work. This is the first post in a mini-series of three — look out for the upcoming ones about our partnerships in the Indian states of Odisha and Telangana.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Our computing curriculum partnerships in Kenya</strong></h2>



<p>Last year, we embarked on partnerships in two areas of Kenya and aimed to roll out computing curriculum resources to students in grades 4 to 9 in Kenyan schools:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In Mombasa County, we began working with delivery partner <a href="https://techkidzafrica.co.ke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tech Kidz Africa</a> and the <a href="https://web.mombasa.go.ke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mombasa County government</a>. The programme is locally referred to as the Advancing Computing Literacy Project.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In parallel, we partnered with the <a href="https://fcdc.or.ke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frontier Counties Development Council (FCDC)</a>, initially in eight counties. Here, the programme is locally referred to as the Digital Literacy Programme.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>During the 2024 academic year, we trained 39 local community trainers, who subsequently trained 453 teachers. We also adapted The Computing Curriculum materials to develop resources — lesson plans, presentation slides, and supporting activities — that are relevant and engaging in the schools our partners work with.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854.jpg" alt="Educators participate in a teacher training in Kenya." class="wp-image-90687" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Impact in 2024</strong></h2>



<p>We estimate that around 55,000 students were reached by our Kenya computing curriculum resources in 2024. Most teachers who had used our resources felt the lessons had improved their students&#8217; knowledge and skills. Of those who responded to our follow-up survey:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>94% agreed that their students had improved their knowledge of computing concepts</li>



<li>92% agreed that their students have developed their computing skills</li>



<li>90% agreed that their students better understand how to use technology safely.</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008.jpg" alt="Young people using tablets in a classroom." class="wp-image-90689" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>This was supported by conversations with teachers and students. In student focus groups, students were able to list topics they had learned about and skills they had developed.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“&#8230;.The lessons have had a significant positive impact on the students. They now demonstrate greater confidence in using technology, particularly with tasks involving programming in Scratch. This has improved their problem-solving skills and made them more engaged in learning.” – Teacher, Mombasa</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“In my computing lessons, I’ve learned how to use a computer safely and properly. I learned how to type, use the mouse, and open programs. We also learned about coding, which is really fun because we can make things happen on the screen by giving the computer instructions. I’ve also learned how to create a simple document using software like Excel sheets. I really enjoy using the computer to solve problems and make things work.” – Learner, Arid and Semi Arid Lands</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Implementation: Challenges, solutions, and building on progress</strong></h2>



<p>While teachers tended to agree that students’ skills and knowledge had increased, fewer felt that most students had achieved the specific learning objectives identified in the resources. This was often due to the content being only partially delivered, for example, due to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/teaching-digital-literacy-without-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limited availability of computing equipment</a> in schools. However, many students lacked prior experience with the topics covered in the lessons, suggesting a large improvement in their skills compared to a low baseline.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004.jpg" alt="Young people learning about computing in a classroom." class="wp-image-90693" style="width:720px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>Similarly, some training sessions were affected by challenges with the equipment, infrastructure, and learning environment available. Teachers were appreciative of the training and many have begun to deliver the computing lessons, but often lacked prior experience with computing and hence requested additional support.</p>



<p>In response to feedback from partners and teachers, we made some updates to our Computing Curriculum and training resources in preparation for the 2025 academic year. For example, we increased the alignment to Kenya’s national curriculum, prepared a more comprehensive teacher guide, and incorporated time for teachers to discuss solutions to common delivery challenges during training.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880.jpg" alt="Educators participate in a teacher training in Kenya." class="wp-image-90696" style="width:720px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>In 2025, we are working with partners to upskill even more teachers and broaden the reach of our computing lessons to a further four counties. Our partners have now begun upskilling both new and existing teachers on the updated resources, and we will continue to work with them to monitor and evaluate their programme’s success in the coming months.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Want to learn more about our curriculum resources?</strong></h2>



<p>You can access our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Computing Curriculum resources on our website</a> — we are currently working to make the materials for Kenya, and for India, downloadable there.</p>

<p>This year marked the <strong>10th anniversary of Coolest Projects Belgium</strong>. The meticulously organised event was held in April by our partner <a href="https://coderdojobelgium.be/nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoderDojo Belgium</a>, at Technopolis in Mechelen. Themed ‘On the move’, the event invited young creators to interpret movement however they liked — which they did in an impressive number of ways, creating projects ranging from mobile robots and Scratch animations to AI tools, health tech devices, and a musical drink maker.</p>

<p>With 52 inspiring creations showcased by 71 young people, there were too many awesome projects to list individually in this blog post. Here are just a few of our highlights from a day filled with big ideas and brilliant builds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rune | IINTS (Insulin Is Not the Solution)</strong></h2>



<p>Rune, who has type 1 diabetes, built his own open-source insulin pump powered by Raspberry Pi Pico W and featuring a custom motor-controlled delivery system designed in Autodesk Fusion.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="709" height="880" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/pi-pic.png" alt="Photo of a Raspberry Pi Pico W." class="wp-image-90638" style="width:420px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/pi-pic.png 709w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/pi-pic-201x250.png 201w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/pi-pic-500x621.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/pi-pic-450x559.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" /></figure></div>


<p>Rune’s pump calculates insulin doses based on carbohydrate amounts entered &#8211; all with the goal of empowering people, raising awareness, and making medical technology more accessible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Amir | AmirAI&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Amir might only be 10, but he is already experimenting with chatbots and AI in creative and playful ways. His self-coded AI assistant could respond live to visitors’ prompts, producing jokes and answers to questions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/DSC01957-1-scaled.jpeg" alt="Rune enjoying themselves during the event." class="wp-image-90634" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/DSC01957-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/DSC01957-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/DSC01957-1-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/DSC01957-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/DSC01957-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/DSC01957-1-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/DSC01957-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/DSC01957-1-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/DSC01957-1-900x600.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure></div>


<p>Amir’s project was a great demonstration of how accessible complex technologies can be when you give young people space to explore them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jules | Operatie Mocktail</strong></h2>



<p>This Arduino-powered machine blends mocktails based on your music choices. Pick a song, and the machine mixes a custom drink to match the song’s mood. It is a joyful combination of engineering, flavour science, and artistic flair.</p>

<p>Jules described it best: “I want to create a unique drinking experience that connects taste and music in a surprising way.” We think it’s just right!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mona | On the Move</strong></h2>



<p>Mona’s project is a reimagination of Michael Rosen’s poem <em>On the Move</em> created in Scratch, featuring animation, sound, and voice-over.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful example of how digital storytelling can give new life to spoken word, and how creative coding platforms like Scratch provide space for emotion and expression.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital making: more than just a skill</strong></h2>



<p>Beyond these projects, the showcase included creations such as autonomous robots, arcade games, imaginative interface devices, and even a computer-controlled magic wand factory made of Lego bricks. Whether it was a creator’s very first Scratch project or a hand-built automaton, the range of work on display showed that coding and digital making are not just skills — they’re tools for self-expression, exploration, and change.</p>



<p>We would like to say a massive thank you to CoderDojo Belgium for hosting such an incredible event, and to the young creators, families, volunteers, and judges who made it such a success.</p>



<p>We are already looking forward to seeing what participants will create next!</p>

<p>At Code Club, we believe learning to code should be as fun as it is empowering — what better way to start than making your own game?</p>

<p>Whether it’s about pixelated pirates, racing robots, or a time-travelling llama, creating a game is one of the most exciting ways to explore coding. We’ve seen young people go from “I like Minecraft” to “I’ve built a space adventure with hedgehogs” in no time at all.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why games?</strong></h2>



<p>Games are more than just fun. They’re also a brilliant gateway into problem solving, creativity, and computational thinking. When you create your own game, you learn how to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use logic and sequences to control what happens</li>



<li>Trigger events and interactions through code</li>



<li>Build characters, stories, and rules — and see them come to life</li>
</ul>



<p>And perhaps most importantly, you get instant feedback. If your code doesn’t quite work, you’ll know right away, and you’ll have the chance to fix it, test it, and improve it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Three fun game projects to try today</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve created a free library of step-by-step game projects that work in a browser, that require no previous experience, and that let imagination lead the way.</p>



<p>Here are three brilliant beginner-friendly projects to try at Code Club or at home:</p>

<p>Creating a computer program involves many different skills — knowing how to code is just one part. When we teach programming to young people, we want to guide them to learn these skills in a structured way. The &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework is a great tool for doing that. This blog describes how using the framework will benefit you and your learners in the computing classroom.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning to program: Everything at once?</h2>



<p>Creating a program from the ground up can be daunting, especially for new learners. Without support, they’ll likely get stuck sooner or later; programs rarely work the first time round. And the more complex the problem that a program is addressing, the more likely it is that the first version of the program won’t work.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1728" height="1152" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8.jpg" alt="In a computing classroom, two girls concentrate on their programming task." class="wp-image-78793" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8.jpg 1728w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1728px) 100vw, 1728px" /></figure></div>


<p>One reason that learning to program can be challenging is that it involves understanding a lot of specific concepts and applying many varied skills. From early on in their learning journey, young people need to have a firm grasp of concepts such as repetition, selection, variables, and functions. Also fundamental to learning to program well is the skill of abstraction: understanding a task and identifying which details are relevant and which can be ignored.</p>



<p>To get to grips with all these different concepts and skills, young people need structure — otherwise they’ll try to hold everything in their head at once, and likely feel overwhelmed by the <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive load</a>. This sort of experience may cause them to disengage instead of persisting. They may even decide that programming is not for them.</p>



<p>In light of these challenges, the &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework is a great tool for teaching.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The benefits of the &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework</h2>



<p>The framework breaks programming down into four levels, each focusing on a different aspect of creating a program:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Problem: Analysing the problem or task the program should address, to understand and record the requirements.</li>



<li>Design: Turning the analysis into an algorithm — a set of steps for the computer to follow to create the desired output. This can involve flowcharts or storyboards, but importantly no code.</li>



<li>Code: Developing the code based on the design (and building the physical components if any are involved).</li>



<li>Running the code: Testing the code, checking outputs, and debugging where necessary.</li>
</ul>



<p>Throughout the processes of developing a program, learners (and professional programmers) move between these levels as they implement their designs and debug them, sometimes even returning to the problem level if more analysis or clarification is needed.</p>

<p>Potential benefits of the &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework for teachers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It helps you break down the activity of programming into discrete parts.</li>



<li>It helps you engage your learners, as you can show them that programming involves more than knowing how to code.</li>



<li>If your learners get stuck with their programming, the framework can help you guide them to a solution.</li>
</ul>



<p>Potential benefits for learners:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The framework will help them think through all the steps needed to create a program that works, and practise their problem-solving skills and analytical thinking.</li>



<li>They will more readily see how programming connects to their world — at the problem level — and find aspects of programming where they have strengths and can use their creativity.</li>



<li>They will gain a stronger idea of how software is built in the tech sector.</li>
</ul>



<p>Our new Quick Read shares tips on how to best use the framework in your teaching.</p>

</div>



<p>Things to aim for when using the framework with your learners:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Be aware of what level they are working at and when it&#8217;s time to switch to a different one.</li>



<li>Understand that, when they encounter an issue with their program, they can step back and use the framework to figure out where the issue comes from. The issue might be a bug in the code, the algorithm not working as intended, or a description of the problem not taking into account something important.</li>
</ul>



<p>We hope you find the framework useful. If you have ideas for how to use it in your teaching, why not share them in the comments?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Teaching programming: The wider context</h2>



<p>When following the ‘levels of abstraction’ approach, learners need to explain how programs work and debug them. That means program comprehension is a key skill here. You may have already helped your learners to develop and practise this skill, for example with <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the PRIMM approach</a>. <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Block Model</a> is another useful tool for helping your learners talk about various aspects of a program. And if you use the <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pair programming approach</a> in programming activities, your learners can improve their program comprehension by talking about their code with each other.

<p>And what about generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools for programmers? In the age of AI, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-kids-still-need-to-learn-to-code-in-the-age-of-ai/">we think young people still need to learn to code</a> because it empowers them to navigate and think critically about all digital technologies, including AI. And while generative AI tools can help a skilled programmer create quality code more quickly, more research is needed to show whether such tools help school-age young people build their understanding as they learn to code. You can see some of the great work being done in this area if you <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research/seminars/previous/programming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">catch up with our 2024 research seminar series</a>.</p>



<p>The &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework is useful in your teaching no matter what tools young people use to create programs. Even with an AI tool, they will still need to work at all four levels of abstraction to program effectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>This blog post is written by Victor Murithi, Communications and Media Consultant at Young Scientists Kenya, one of our global partners for Experience AI in Kenya.</em></p>



<p>When over 100 teachers from across Kenya gathered at Kangaru High School in Embu County for the Kenya Science and Engineering Fair Nationals in April, few anticipated just how transformative a two-day workshop could be. Delivered by the Experience AI Young Scientists Kenya (YSK) team, with support from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, the training sparked more than curiosity — it sparked a shift in mindset.</p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t just about introducing new tools: it was about empowering teachers to confidently lead their students into an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven future.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1066" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image.jpeg" alt="Students in a classroom learn about Experience AI." class="wp-image-90526" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image.jpeg 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-900x600.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>National reach and local impact</strong></h2>



<p>What began as a plan to train just 40 teachers quickly grew into something much bigger. By the time the workshop kicked off, 104 teachers from over 80 schools across 37 counties in Kenya, had registered and participated — nearly tripling the initial target.</p>



<p>This overwhelming interest confirmed a powerful insight: teachers are eager to understand AI, not only to better prepare their students for the future, but also for their own professional growth.</p>



<p>The workshop’s curriculum didn’t just focus on technical skills, it aimed to create confidence, clarity, and community among the attendees — key ingredients for successfully integrating AI into teaching and learning.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Helping teachers move past their fear of AI and understand its potential is incredibly powerful. Because AI is the future, and through this training, we’re reaching the minds that will shape it,” explained Lucy Mwaniki, AI Community Trainer at YSK.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical skills, real outcomes</strong></h2>



<p>As part of the training, the attendees completed interactive worksheets, tested basic machine learning models, and sat a final comprehension test, something they found both validating and motivational.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We were able to do the summative test… which turned out to be a very effective way of us understanding how in-depth and how well they grasped the knowledge,” says Lucy Mwaniki<em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>In one standout session, teachers collaboratively brainstormed ways AI could address national educational challenges. Ideas included models to assist students in selecting academic pathways within Kenya’s Competency Based Curriculum (CBC). Several teachers also successfully built working models, demonstrating the potential of applied learning.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It was a very eye-opening session… some of the teachers were able to create a very basic model, which was a wonderful experience for them,” Lucy Mwaniki<strong> </strong>explains.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>What made this training exceptional was its immediate applicability and long-term vision. By the end of two days, teachers weren&#8217;t just AI-aware — they were AI-ready, with many already starting to explore how AI tools could support entrepreneurship, lesson planning, and personalised learning pathways.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1496" height="1496" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1.jpeg" alt="Students in a classroom setting; two of them are using a laptop to learn about AI." class="wp-image-90527" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1.jpeg 1496w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-250x250.jpeg 250w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-500x500.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-450x450.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-900x900.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1496px) 100vw, 1496px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Celebrating our achievements and impact&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>At the close of the training, each teacher received a Certificate of Participation, recognising their commitment to professional development and their new capacity to bring AI into the classroom. The awarding of certificates added a sense of accomplishment and pride, reinforcing that teachers are key drivers of technological transformation in education.</p>



<p>And the impact of the training was measurable:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>95% of teachers agreed that the training increased their knowledge and confidence to teach AI concepts</strong></li>



<li><strong>88% of teachers agreed that the training was high quality and useful for preparing them to teach the Experience AI lessons</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>But it doesn’t end there, as Vanessa Inziani, Head of Programs at YSK, explains, “Our commitment doesn’t end with the training — we continue to support educators with resources, mentorship, and follow-up to ensure success in delivering the program in the classroom.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking ahead towards a promising AI journey</strong></h2>



<p>With the rapidly evolving digital landscape, AI is no longer a distant concept — it’s a present-day classroom necessity. Yet, introducing AI into schools isn’t just about technical literacy; it’s about confidence, clarity, and community and the approach the Young Scientist Kenya team and Experience AI delivered during the two-day training is anchored in this belief.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As AI continues to shape the global education landscape, programs like Experience AI provide the bridge needed to equip teachers, inspire students, and future-proof education systems. The Kangaru High School session was not a one-off — it was a catalyst for systemic change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experience AI is scaling. As it expands across Kenya and beyond, the benefits are clear:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Empowered educators</strong> who gain confidence and skills to integrate AI in their teaching</li>



<li><strong>Future-ready students</strong> who grasp foundational AI concepts and their real-world applications</li>



<li><strong>Sustainable impact</strong> as trained teachers go on to influence thousands of learners in their communities</li>
</ul>



<p>The journey from fear to fluency starts with a single step, a willingness for us all to explore what’s possible. Together, we can equip educators, inspire students, and shape Kenya’s future, one AI-literate classroom at a time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>About Experience AI</em></strong></h2>



<p><em>Experience AI is an AI literacy programme, co-developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Google DeepMind, that teaches students aged 11 to 14 about AI and machine learning.
