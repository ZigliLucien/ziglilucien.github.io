<p>At the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we believe that learning to program equips young people with the knowledge and skills they need to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-kids-still-need-to-learn-to-code-in-the-age-of-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thrive in an increasingly digital world</a>. For many educators, teaching programming effectively can be challenging, particularly when their learners are at different stages in their programming journey. Ask learners to write code too early, and they might struggle or feel intimidated. Rely too heavily on step-by-step instructions, and you limit learners’ chances to explore ideas or develop deeper understanding.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/11038_OC_PRIMM_1.png" alt="Using PRIMM to teach programming artwork" class="wp-image-92630" style="aspect-ratio:1.7752067341565618;width:784px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/11038_OC_PRIMM_1.png 600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/11038_OC_PRIMM_1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/11038_OC_PRIMM_1-500x282.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/11038_OC_PRIMM_1-450x254.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>The <a href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/curriculum/quickreads/11-Pedagogy_Summary_PRIMM_V4_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PRIMM framework</a> — Predict, Run, Investigate, Modify, Make — provides educators with a structure for teaching programming. This <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/primm-talk-in-programming-lessons-research-seminar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research-informed teaching approach</a> balances support with independence and helps learners build their understanding before they write their own code, whatever their starting point.</p>



<p>To help educators use this approach confidently, we have launched a new short online course, <a href="http://rpf.io/using-primm?utm_source=blog-post&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=training-hub-2026&amp;utm_id=primm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Using PRIMM to teach programming</em></a>, which is available on our new <a href="https://training-hub.raspberrypi.org/en/courses?utm_source=blog-post&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=training-hub-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Training Hub</a> platform for free.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is the course about?</h2>



<p>This practical, self-paced course gives educators the knowledge they need to use the PRIMM approach to design and adapt programming activities to suit their learners.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Online course: Using PRIMM to teach programming" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e68qEOeOKXI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The course takes 1–2 hours to complete, and we have designed it for educators working in formal or non-formal learning environments around the world, using any block-based or text-based programming language. All you need is some experience of creating and adapting simple programs.</p>



<p>The course starts with considering the five stages of PRIMM, when and why to use each stage, and how they work together to support learning. It covers how PRIMM aligns with key teaching principles such as scaffolding, managing cognitive load, and progression, and examines how the approach supports formative assessment by making learners’ thinking — and any misunderstandings — more visible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Active, social learning</h2>



<p>Although pedagogy forms the core of this course, we have deliberately avoided a theory-heavy approach. Instead, the course is designed to help you learn through hands-on activities. By reflecting, taking part in discussions with other computing educators, and completing practical tasks, you will explore how PRIMM works in real teaching contexts.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/06/Spencer_10-1-800x533.jpg" alt="A computer science teacher sits with students at computers in a classroom." class="wp-image-84333" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/06/Spencer_10-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/06/Spencer_10-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/06/Spencer_10-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/06/Spencer_10-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/06/Spencer_10-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/06/Spencer_10-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/06/Spencer_10-1-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/06/Spencer_10-1.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>After an introduction to the core ideas of PRIMM, you will design a new programming activity, or adapt an existing one, using the PRIMM structure. This will support you to think carefully about what your learners know and can do, likely misconceptions, and how each stage of PRIMM can be used effectively, including when your learners have varied learning needs and levels of programming experience.</p>



<p>With its emphasis on activity design, the course will support you to develop resources you can use and keep adapting in your own setting. By the end, you will have a complete PRIMM activity designed specifically for your learners, and a clear sense of how to teach programming in a structured and supportive way.</p>

<p>In a recent seminar in <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/how-can-we-teach-students-about-ai-and-data-science-2025-seminar-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our series on teaching about AI and data science</a>, researcher <a href="https://www.us.es/trabaja-en-la-us/directorio/jesus-moreno-leon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jesús Moreno-León</a> (Universidad de Sevilla) talked about his work in developing assessment tools for computational thinking (CT) and AI literacy. Jesús is also co-founder of <a href="https://programamos.es/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Programamos</a>, a non-profit organisation that promotes the development of computational thinking, supporting teachers through training and sharing resources.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Developing assessment tools in computer science</h2>



<p>Jesús began by discussing the recent development of computer science assessment tools. Together with <a href="https://gsyc.urjc.es/~grex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregorio Robles</a> (Universidad Rey Juan Carlos), they created <a href="http://drscratch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr Scratch</a>, a web-based tool to assess the quality of Scratch projects and detect errors and bad programming habits (e.g. dead code). Projects are scored on the use of computational thinking concepts (e.g. parallelism, conditional logic) and the use of desirable programming practices (e.g. naming sprites, removing duplicate scripts) in order to give feedback to students and teachers to iteratively improve their Scratch projects.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="351" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/image3-1.png" alt="Dr Scratch tool." class="wp-image-92601" style="aspect-ratio:1.7094343222360011;width:770px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/image3-1.png 600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/image3-1-300x176.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/image3-1-500x293.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/image3-1-450x263.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Dr Scratch tool.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Alongside measuring students’ programming skills, Jesús also shared work by <a href="https://www.uned.es/universidad/docentes/en/educacion/marcos-roman-gonzalez.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marcos Román-González</a> (Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia) to develop the Computational Thinking test (CTt), a 28-item assessment tool designed to measure the computational thinking skills of students aged 10 to 16 years old. Two collaborators, <a href="https://servicios.urjc.es/pdi/ver/maria.zapata" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">María Zapata</a> and <a href="https://servicios.urjc.es/pdi/ver/estefania.martin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Estafanía Martín</a> (Universidad Rey Juan Carlos) further adapted these items to create the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/research-seminar-computational-thinking-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beginners Computational Thinking test</a> (or BCTt), an unplugged assessment suitable for younger learners aged 5 to 10 years old.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Teaching about AI in Spain</h2>



<p>Jesús also described his more recent work at the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training in Spain to promote computer science at all educational levels. One initiative, <a href="https://code.intef.es/iniciativas/epcia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">La Escuela de Pensamiento Computacional e Inteligencia Artificial</a> (or the School of Computational Thinking and Artificial Intelligence), supported Spanish teachers through training and resources to introduce CT and AI into the classroom. Over 400 teachers and 7000 teachers took part across Spain through unplugged activities and tools such as <a href="https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Machine Learning for Kids</a> and <a href="https://web.learningml.org/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LearningML</a>, allowing students to classify text and images using machine learning. Older students created apps using the <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MIT App Inventor</a>. When evaluating the design of the curriculum, they found they had strong instruments to measure the development of CT — such as the assessment tools described above — yet nothing to measure AI literacy.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="337" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/image2-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-92602" style="width:728px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/image2-1.png 600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/image2-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/image2-1-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/image2-1-450x253.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The School of Computational Thinking and Artificial Intelligence curriculum.</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A tool for measuring AI literacy</h2>



<p>The lack of valid AI literacy assessment tools led the team to develop the AI Knowledge Test (or AIKT), a 14-item survey consisting of multiple-choice questions designed to measure students’ understanding of AI. The instrument was inspired by previous work in the field and relevant research (e.g. the <a href="https://ai4k12.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI4K12 framework</a>).</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">An example from the AI Knowledge Test</h3>



<p>An example of one of these items is presented below. Can you solve it? The answer is at the bottom of this article.</p>



<p><strong><em>Q1. Which of the following strategies would be most appropriate for teaching a computer to recognise photos of apples?</em></strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Train the computer with photos of dogs</em></li>



<li><em>Train the computer with several photos of different apples, taken in different places and contexts</em></li>



<li><em>Train the computer with several similar photos of the same apple, taken in the same place</em></li>



<li><em>Train the computer with several identical copies of the same photo of an apple</em></li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Testing the test</h3>



<p>In a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3677619.3678111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study on the impact of programming activities</a> on computational thinking and AI literacy in Spanish schools, the authors tested these knowledge-based items with over 2000 students to assess the reliability (e.g. internal consistency), or a measure of the quality of a survey or test. They found one item (“As a user, the legal regulation that is approved regarding AI systems will affect my life”) did not correlate with the other items. This left a total of 13 items which were found to have sufficient internal consistency — meaning how well each item correlated with one another to measure an underlying construct (i.e. “AI knowledge”). They concluded that the assessment tool needed a higher ceiling and needed to address common misconceptions. The authors also learned that teachers needed free and open-source tools with low barriers for entry, such as not needing registration, and were suitable for classroom use, such as limiting data sent to the cloud.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI literacy in the generative era</h2>



<p>With the rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini, Jesús and his colleagues felt their AI literacy assessment tool needed to focus on the capabilities of generative AI tools. They also felt they needed to take a broader view of AI and focus on additional dimensions, such as the social and ethical implications of AI tools. They are, therefore, currently revising their assessment items to align with several common frameworks, including the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/">SEAME framework</a> and <a href="https://csteachers.org/ai-priorities/">AI Learning Priorities for All K–12 Students</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">An example from the revised AI Knowledge Test</h3>



<p>One of the revised items is presented below. Can you solve it? The answer is revealed below.</p>



<p><strong><em>Q2. You have asked your students to design a decision tree to classify different fruits based on three characteristics: color, size, and shape. To check whether the following proposed solution is correct, you are going to test it. As what fruit does the decision tree classify a <strong><em>small, round, yellow apple</em></strong>?</em></strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Apple</em></li>



<li><em>Watermelon</em></li>



<li><em>Lemon</em></li>



<li><em>Banana</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Learning Python often starts with the same building blocks: variables, functions, and loops. However, once young people have learnt these essential foundations, they may be eager to grow their skills and start using Python to explore data and create something meaningful to them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our free <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/more-python?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=ccp_python_q126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘More Python’ project path</a> helps learners move beyond the basics and use data to create impactful projects of their own.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Python as a tool for exploring the world</h2>



<p>Python is the most widely used programming language in the world, not just because it’s accessible, but because it’s powerful. It is used to analyse data, build models, create data visualisations, and explore important questions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-48-800x533.jpg" alt="A young learners is excited about his Python project." class="wp-image-92577" style="aspect-ratio:1.500418643594753;width:750px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-48-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-48-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-48-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-48-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-48-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-48-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-48-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-48.jpg 2000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>For young learners, this means learning Python can become more than a coding exercise. It can be a way to investigate topics they care about, analyse and understand information, and tell powerful stories about real-world issues.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="688" height="361" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/banner-blog.png" alt="A illustration featuring examples of different types of graphs: a line graph, a bar chart, and a venn diagram." class="wp-image-92579" style="aspect-ratio:1.9058521007009248;width:760px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/banner-blog.png 688w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/banner-blog-300x157.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/banner-blog-500x262.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/banner-blog-450x236.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>Working with data helps learners see how coding connects to the world around them — and builds confidence along the way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why learning with data matters</strong></h2>



<p>In our day-to-day lives, data is everywhere: in sports results, maps, and scientific research, to name only a few examples. Learning how to work with data helps young people develop skills that go far beyond programming, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Thinking logically and solving problems</li>



<li>Interpreting and questioning information</li>



<li>Making decisions based on evidence</li>
</ul>



<p>Data also underpins many of the AI systems people use today. For example, large language models, used to build tools such as ChatGPT, are trained on vast amounts of data. Therefore, understanding how data is collected, organised, and used is an important part of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/teach/ai-education" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI literacy</a>.</p>



<p>In Python, structures like lists and dictionaries make it possible to organise, analyse, and explore data in creative ways. Using these tools to build projects can help abstract computing concepts start to feel more concrete and meaningful.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What learners create in the ‘More Python’ project path</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/more-python?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=ccp_python_q126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘More Python’ project path</a> supports learners through <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/free-coding-resources-children-young-people-digital-making-independence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three stages</a>: Explore, Design, and Invent. Each stage builds skills while giving learners more ownership over what they create.</p>



<p>In the <strong>Explore</strong> stage, young people learn new concepts and build confidence in using data and core Python structures, such as lists and dictionaries. Projects include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Making an interactive chart of Olympic medals</li>



<li>Building a model of the solar system</li>



<li>Creating a frequency graph that learners can analyse to crack a code</li>
</ul>



<p>These projects help learners develop new skills, while exploring how Python can be used to analyse and explain real-world information.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-24-800x533.jpg" alt="A young learner uses the Code Club Projects site on computer to do Python coding." class="wp-image-92584" style="aspect-ratio:1.500418643594753;width:778px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-24-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-24-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-24-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-24-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-24-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-24-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-24-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/CC_York-24.jpg 2000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>As learners progress to the <strong>Design</strong> stage, they start making creative choices about how their projects look and behave. In this stage, they:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Create a project that produces encoded art based on a user’s name</li>



<li>Build an interactive world map that helps users learn interesting facts</li>
</ul>



<p>Here, Python becomes a creative medium. As well as putting their new skills into practice, learners think about audience, interaction, and presentation to make their projects their own.</p>



<p>In the <strong>Invent</strong> stage, learners bring everything together. Using the skills they have built, they design and create a data visualisation on a topic they are passionate about. This final project gives learners the freedom to choose their data, shape their idea, and tell a story that matters to them.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="688" height="361" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/banner-blog-2.png" alt="An illustration of a robot on wheels." class="wp-image-92585" style="width:772px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/banner-blog-2.png 688w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/banner-blog-2-300x157.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/banner-blog-2-500x262.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/banner-blog-2-450x236.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>By this point, learners are planning and creating their own projects, growing in confidence and independence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Take the next step with Pytho</strong>n</h2>



<p>If the young people you support have already learned the basics of Python, ‘More Python’ offers a clear and creative next step. The projects are designed to be accessible, and young people can work through them at their own pace, whether they are learning independently, at a <a href="https://codeclub.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Club</a>, or in the classroom.</p>



<p>By working with data, getting creative, and making their own original projects, learners can build confidence and start to see what they can achieve with Python.</p>

<p>Where do great research ideas come from in computer science education? We might think of research breakthroughs as a single moment of genius, but in reality impactful research is often the result of many years of iterative development. In November’s research seminar, we heard from <a href="https://www.karl-emil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Karl-Emil Kjær Bilstrup</a>, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen, about his work to develop<a href="http://ml-machine.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ML-Machine</a>. This work uses embodied learning principles and the BBC micro:bit to introduce learners to machine learning concepts. Findings from this research have been used to develop the <a href="https://createai.microbit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">micro:bit CreateAI resources</a>, and in this blog, we will explain the research journey from initial small-scale work to educational resources used by many young learners around the world.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">From hypothetical ethics to concrete machines</h2>



<p>In Karl-Emil’s <a href="https://pure.au.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/190605815/StagingReflectionsOnEthicalDilemmasInMachineLearning.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first research study</a>, students used prompt cards to develop ideas for machine learning applications that could solve real-world problems, and to discuss the ethical dilemmas associated with their solutions. Students found it difficult to address these ethical dilemmas in their designs; for example, their ideas often featured a trade-off of user privacy. The findings from this research informed Karl-Emil’s next study, which moved from hypothetical scenarios to implementing machine learning in real-world settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3430524.3440638">‘Machine Learning Machine’ study</a> made machine learning processes tangible for students through the use of two physical boxes, shown in the picture below. Students created drawings and fed them into the first box to train a model, and then tested the model by placing new drawings under a camera in the second box and having the model produce predictions of what the drawings showed. For example, students could draw pictures of the sun to represent daytime and the moon to represent nighttime to train a model to predict whether new drawings represented day or night. The machine was built for slow interaction, giving students time to think about the concepts and practices that they were developing. In <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marianne-Petersen/publication/364264949_The_Best_of_Both_Worlds_Designing_a_Tiered_Hybrid_Interface_for_Teaching_Machine_Learning_in_K-9_Education/links/647dbc87b3dfd73b7767dd59/The-Best-of-Both-Worlds-Designing-a-Tiered-Hybrid-Interface-for-Teaching-Machine-Learning-in-K-9-Education.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a follow-up study</a>, a new version of the Machine Learning Machine had been designed, which was controlled using a graphical user interface (GUI). This allowed users to “unbox” and influence parts of the machine learning process. For example, students could adjust the number of complete passes (called ‘epochs’<em>) </em>through the training data to improve the model’s accuracy.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>The two studies with the Machine Learning Machines provided many useful findings for teaching about machine learning with K–12 (primary and secondary) learners. However, two constraints remained: firstly, there were limited opportunities for whole-class work because there was only one Machine Learning Machine, and secondly, learning experiences needed to be better connected to examples from students’ daily lives. As a result, the next iteration in Karl-Emil’s research involved using the micro:bit, which ensured access to a tangible device for every student, and a new graphical platform called <a href="http://ml-machine.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ML-Machine</a> that students could interact with.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://microbit.org/get-started/what-is-the-microbit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">micro:bit</a> is a small, programmable computing device that features sensors to gather data from the immediate environment. For example, the <a href="https://microbit.org/get-started/features/sensors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accelerometer</a> is a motion sensor that can detect when the micro:bit is tilted from left to right, backwards and forwards, and up and down. Using the micro:bit with <a href="http://ml-machine.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ML-Machine</a> and some common household objects, students can create simple machine learning models that use data from the micro:bit’s accelerometer to detect whether the micro:bit is moving. This is a very different approach from rule-based programs on the micro:bit, where students might use programming constructs such as if statements to detect movement if the numerical reading from the accelerometer is above a certain value. Here, a machine learning model trained using a set of 20 examples is used to analyse live data readings and produce predictions about whether the micro:bit is moving.</p>

</div>


<p>In our seminar, Karl-Emil gave a live demonstration of the ML-Machine toolkit, so we highly recommend watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnPwaIckR9c&amp;list=PLxyaWvsfmq497kQR_KGF1UoijvZHDBZfh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recording</a> to see how this toolkit brings machine learning concepts to life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ML-Machine is the precursor to the <a href="https://createai.microbit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">micro:bit CreateAI</a> resources, and the software is fully <a href="https://github.com/microbit-foundation/cctd-ml-machine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-source</a>. However, the innovation doesn’t stop there: Karl-Emil also explained that he is currently developing a new tool called <a href="http://math.ml-machine.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">math.ml-machine.org</a>, where students can train a neural network and see a visualised k-nearest neighbour model to explore how a model makes predictions. The research journey is continuing, with new possibilities for educational opportunities to teach about machine learning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Embodied learning</h2>



<p>The idea of embodied learning is interwoven throughout all of Karl-Emil’s research projects and is a cornerstone of all of his work. Embodied learning suggests that we learn more effectively when our whole body is involved in the learning process, not just our minds. For example, in the work described in this seminar, the Machine Learning Machines and the micro:bit were all tangible devices that students could touch and see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Embodied learning is particularly important in activities that involve working with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/a-research-led-framework-for-teaching-about-models-in-ai-and-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data-driven systems</a>. In traditional programming activities, the flow of code can be traced transparently through a program. However, <a href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/curriculum/quickreads/21-Pedagogy_Summary_Computational_Thinking_2_2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">machine learning models are more opaque</a>, and their outputs cannot be traced step by step. Students can benefit from using bodily movements and sensorimotor information to help understand machine learning concepts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ML-Machine toolkit was designed to support students to learn through embodied learning in three different ways:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Enacting machine learning processes:</strong> Students used bodily movement to collect the data samples needed for the ML-Machine model to detect and predict gestures&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Using machine learning as a design material:</strong> Students created concrete ‘objects-to-think-with’, which helps form deeper connections to abstract concepts</li>



<li><strong>Embodied exploration of machine learning:</strong> Students experienced how their bodily movements were translated into data points on the screen</li>
</ol>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--scaled.jpg" alt="Secondary school age learners in a computing classroom." class="wp-image-85670" style="aspect-ratio:1.4997489259610557;width:740px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>Embodied learning helped students grasp concepts such as data quality. They could see how their bodily movements were being translated into digital data, and could spot when movements that appeared different to them were being classified as similar by the ML-Machine model. One case study participant described that the immediate feedback on screen made the concept of machine learning feel as if it were “coming to life as they [the students] manipulate something themselves and they’ve got control over it”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Find out more</h2>



<p>Karl-Emil’s work shows how research ideas can be used in the classroom through a cycle of discovery, design, and reflection. From prompt cards exploring ethics to tangible machines and the micro:bit-based ML-Machine, his research shows how embodied learning can make complex ideas like machine learning not only understandable, but deeply engaging for young learners. The micro:bit CreateAI resources are a great example of how research findings can evolve into accessible, hands-on tools that empower educators and students alike. As this work continues to grow, it invites us to imagine new ways for learners to experience machine learning not as abstract theory, but as something they can see, feel, and shape with their own hands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The online world that young people navigate today is different from the one we encountered just a few years ago: the search engines, social media platforms and digital tools they use to find information, interact with friends and complete schoolwork are now deeply embedded with AI technologies.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage1-1.png" alt="Experience AI Safety Image" class="wp-image-92537" style="width:690px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage1-1.png 600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage1-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage1-1-500x282.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage1-1-450x254.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>While the core aims of online safety education remain the same, the scope must now expand to include AI literacy: the ability to use, question and navigate AI tools so young people can make responsible choices online.</p>



<p>This is a shared challenge for anyone who supports young people as they navigate the online world: parents and carers, youth leaders and volunteers, and educators across all subjects. Many young people use these AI tools independently, often without guidance, so having open and useful conversations about trust, risk and responsibility matter just as much in the classroom as they do at dinner tables and <a href="https://codeclub.org/en/" type="link" id="https://codeclub.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Clubs</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why AI literacy is essential for staying safe online</strong></h2>



<p>At the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we have developed various AI literacy resources for educators, club leaders and parents to address this challenge in age-appropriate and practical ways. Our ‘<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://experience-ai.org/en/units/ai-safety&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1770717389628496&amp;usg=AOvVaw28EV01Fhuz9Z0QPe4hsfIB" type="link" id="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://experience-ai.org/en/units/ai-safety&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1770717389628496&amp;usg=AOvVaw28EV01Fhuz9Z0QPe4hsfIB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI safety</a>’ resources, part of our <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://experience-ai.org/en/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1770717389630227&amp;usg=AOvVaw3TRgOtlATMoIXXTx9jBOCR" type="link" id="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://experience-ai.org/en/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1770717389630227&amp;usg=AOvVaw3TRgOtlATMoIXXTx9jBOCR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI programme</a>, are a set of free comprehensive teaching activities to support you in educating young people aged 11–14 in navigating key safety issues linked to AI, including privacy, misinformation, trust and responsibility. Delivered through videos, unplugged activities and discussions, the activities are adaptable to a range of learning settings, and reflect the real decisions young people are already making online.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage2-1.png" alt="Experience AI safety image" class="wp-image-92538" style="width:746px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage2-1.png 600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage2-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage2-1-500x282.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage2-1-450x254.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>For example, in the ‘Trusted Sources’ activity from the ‘<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://experience-ai.org/en/units/ai-safety/lessons/10&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1770717389630681&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Jo55TLiPHrmNOKOk136Bu" type="link" id="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://experience-ai.org/en/units/ai-safety/lessons/10&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1770717389630681&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Jo55TLiPHrmNOKOk136Bu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Media literacy in the age of AI</a>’ lesson, young people reflect on the ways they look for information related to schoolwork, news and in their free time. They consider which sources are likely to allow the use of generative AI and how that affects their trustworthiness. Rather than labelling sources as ‘good’ or ‘bad’, learners explore questions around responsibility, credibility and oversight, and build practical skills for fact-checking and staying safe online.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Supporting responsible use of generative AI through Experience AI</strong></h2>



<p>Alongside the ‘AI safety’ resources, we have also developed a new ‘Large Language Models (LLMs)’ unit for learners aged 11–13 and 14–17, currently being tested in classrooms. The unit focuses on another important aspect of online safety: how young people interact responsibly with AI tools that generate content. While helpful, learners’ uncritical use of these tools could lead to cognitive offloading and limit the development of their higher-order thinking skills. The confident, persuasive tone of LLMs can also make it harder for young people to judge accuracy, recognise bias or notice missing information in outputs.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage3-1.png" alt="Experience AI safety image" class="wp-image-92542" style="width:756px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage3-1.png 600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage3-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage3-1-500x282.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/AISAfetyImage3-1-450x254.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>To support the critical thinking skills that are essential for staying safe online, the new LLM unit includes research-informed lessons that explore how LLMs are created, why their outputs are not always accurate and how to evaluate AI-generated responses. The unit also encourages learners to reflect on when using an LLM is helpful to their learning, when it is not, and how they can remain in control of their own thinking, learning and skills development.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Starting the conversation this Safer Internet Day</strong></h2>



<p>Helping young people stay safe online in the age of AI doesn’t require having all the answers. Instead, it’s about creating the space to pause, question, and think critically about what they are encountering online. Through carefully designed, research-informed and pedagogically aligned AI literacy resources, we aim to help you start the conversations that empower young people to think critically, stay curious and remain in control of their learning and online lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our aim for the study is to understand how primary school teachers approach teaching about data-driven technologies, and to find suitable methods for building young people’s confidence in working with data in computing lessons.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is data-driven computing?</strong></h2>



<p>Research has suggested that new data-driven technologies such as AI and machine learning (or ML) require <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/a-research-led-framework-for-teaching-about-models-in-ai-and-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a different approach to teaching about problem-solving</a> in the computing classroom. Instead of defining a set of rules (e.g. if-then-else statements, or a <strong>rule-based</strong> approach), learners must instead collect lots of data to train a model (a <strong>data-driven</strong> approach) such as using Google’s Teachable Machine to classify image data.</p>



<p>For educators and resource developers, we still lack a clear understanding of how to teach young people about how rule-based and data-driven systems differ, how we can talk about them, and how we develop young people’ mental models. We hope this study will help us to find practical ways for primary teachers to build young people’s understanding of AI data in the primary computing classroom.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What does the study involve?</strong></h2>



<p>If you teach at primary level (Years 4, 5 and 6 or P5–P7) in England, Scotland or Wales and are keen to shape how we teach young people about data-driven computing, we invite you to join our new study.</p>

<p>In today’s blog, we explore the PICRAT framework and how it can help you reflect on your use of technology in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also share our new <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PICRAT Quick Read</a>, which you can download for free to: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Find practical tips on how to use the PICRAT model when planning your lessons</li>



<li>Read a summary of the research behind the framework</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the PICRAT framework?</strong></h2>



<p>Technology is constantly changing, and educators must continually decide what tools to use in their practice. To help with this challenge, researchers started developing theoretical models that teachers (especially student teachers) could use to reflect on how they integrate technology in their classrooms.</p>



<p>You might already be familiar with frameworks like TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy, and Content Knowledge) and SAMR (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition). While these models are useful, the PICRAT framework was created to address gaps in these earlier models, offering a clearer, student-focused approach. Significantly, it encourages you to treat technology as a tool to support learning, rather than the goal itself.</p>



<p>It asks two simple questions: “How are students experiencing the technology?” and “How does this impact your practice?”. The answers to these questions form a matrix as pictured below.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="288" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/PICRAT-Matrix-500x288.png" alt="" class="wp-image-92497" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/PICRAT-Matrix-500x288.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/PICRAT-Matrix-300x173.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/PICRAT-Matrix-450x259.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/PICRAT-Matrix.png 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>PIC (which runs along the y-axis) refers to the student&#8217;s relationship to the technology:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Passive – Students receive learning through technology</li>



<li>Interactive – Students interact with the content or other learning through technology </li>



<li>Creative – Students construct knowledge using technology</li>
</ul>



<p>RAT (which runs along the x-axis) refers to how the teacher uses the technology:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Replaces – Using technology but with an existing pedagogy</li>



<li>Amplifies – Using technology to improve pedagogy or outcomes</li>



<li>Transforms – Using technology to create new pedagogical practices</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How can I apply the PICRAT model?</strong></h2>



<p>First choose the lesson you’re planning to deliver. Consider what activities you’ll be running and the technologies involved. You’ll then be able to plot where they sit on the matrix using the PICRAT acronym.</p>



<p>For example, if you are teaching a lesson on Python loops, you might initially plan for students to watch a pre-recorded coding tutorial on their laptops. In this scenario, the student experience is Passive (receiving info via tech), and the teacher&#8217;s use is Replacement because the video simply replaces a live lecture. To move up the matrix, you could instead have students use an online IDE to complete a &#8220;Parson’s Problem&#8221; puzzle where they rearrange blocks of code to fix a loop. This shifts the activity to Interactive and Amplification, as the digital tool provides immediate debugging feedback that a paper-based exercise could not.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="288" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/Educator-Presenting-Clubs-Conference-2023-500x288.png" alt="Educator presenting in a classroom." class="wp-image-92500" style="width:552px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/Educator-Presenting-Clubs-Conference-2023-500x288.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/Educator-Presenting-Clubs-Conference-2023-300x173.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/Educator-Presenting-Clubs-Conference-2023-450x259.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/Educator-Presenting-Clubs-Conference-2023.png 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>Next, think about how you might move your practice forwards. Although every position on the matrix has its own value, the framework is hierarchical. The overall goal is to try to move your practice towards the top right of the matrix to be Creative and Transformative.</p>



<p>To help you achieve this, take some time to reflect on your current lessons, activities, and the technologies you use. Ask yourself questions like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What does the technology I’m using offer that could be used to amplify my practice?
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What benefits would this have for students?</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Does the technology present opportunities for students to interact with each other, not just the technology?</li>



<li>What other technological tools might support collaboration? </li>
</ul>



<p>Research highlights that technology is rarely used in ways that allow young people to be creative. By using the PICRAT matrix, teachers can identify missed opportunities and explore ways to transform their lessons, ensuring learners can be creative and thrive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The benefits of the PICRAT model</strong></h2>



<p>Potential benefits for educators:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The framework encourages meaningful reflections, allowing teachers to easily evaluate how they’re using technology within their lessons</li>



<li>Reflections and the PICRAT matrix helps teachers to identify missed opportunities and gaps in their practice, ultimately leading to better student experiences</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the PICRAT framework as part of your own reflections, or as part of a group activity. It’s a great way to spark discussion about technology integration with colleagues and improve best practices.</p>

<p>Coolest Projects is the world’s leading technology showcase for young people, a space where creativity, curiosity, and problem-solving come together through code. Last November, <a href="https://online.coolestprojects.org/">Coolest Projects</a> returned to South Africa, providing another exciting opportunity to celebrate and amplify the voices of young digital creators across Mzansi, a local name for South Africa.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Coolest Projects brings young people together to share what excites them the most about creating with technology, whether that&#8217;s making a game, a website, a robot, or a simple Scratch animation. What matters most is not perfection, but participation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A showcase for young makers</h2>



<p>Coolest Projects, an initiative of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, is brought to South Africa by our long-standing partner <a href="https://coderlevelup.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coder:LevelUp</a>, giving young people the space to share how they get creative with technology.</p>



<p>I spent the day surrounded by young people explaining their ideas with a mix of excitement, nerves, and confidence — the kind of emotions you get when you build something yourself and someone is finally asking you about it.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="384" height="512" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-2.jpg" alt="A group of people standing around a table." class="wp-image-92463" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-2.jpg 384w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-2-188x250.jpg 188w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>The event brought together over 250 young people to share the projects they had been working on. Some had been preparing for months, while others had begun exploring their ideas more recently. All of them arrived ready to explain what they made, how it worked, and what they would do differently next time.</p>



<p>There wasn&#8217;t a single kind of project. There was a Scratch animation at one table, a game at the next, and a hardware project across the room. Some projects were polished, others rougher around the edges. But the event isn’t about perfection, it&#8217;s about learning and having the courage to show your work.</p>



<p>For a lot of participants, this was the first time they had presented their work to an audience, and you could see their confidence build as they spoke. By the end of the day, many were already talking about what they wanted to build next! From experience, we know that many of these young people will come back to Coolest Projects in the future, with our <a href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/coolestprojects/Coolest_Projects_2025_impact_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global impact data</a> showing that over 1 in 10 participants in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/coolest-projects-2025-where-11980-young-tech-creators-shared-their-ideas/">Coolest Projects online showcase in 2025</a> had also taken part in Coolest Projects in 2024.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The coolest projects and the coolest people</h2>



<p>One of my favourite things about Coolest Projects is that although you might come for the projects, what stays with you is often the people behind them. Coolest Projects celebrates both what young people build and who they are becoming.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The coolest projects</h3>



<p>A project that really stood out to me was created by a group of girls who built a language app that translates words from isiZulu, one of South Africa’s official languages, into French and other languages — an ambitious and thoughtful idea.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-5-500x375.jpg" alt="A group of students looking at a computer screen." class="wp-image-92467" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-5-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-5-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-5.jpg 512w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>What made this project especially meaningful to me was how well it reflected South Africa’s identity as a rainbow nation, with 12 official languages and countless cultures intersecting everyday. Their work wasn&#8217;t just technical, it was deeply relevant. It showed how young creators are already thinking about inclusion, communication, and using technology to bridge the gap between people in different parts of the country. Seeing these young girls confidently present such a culturally aware solution was incredibly inspiring.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">And the coolest people</h3>



<p>A group of boys arrived with a project that, honestly, fell apart on the day. Things didn’t work the way they had planned. But instead of shutting down or panicking, they laughed it off, explained what should have happened, and kept the energy positive. Their confidence, humour, and teamwork were great to see.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="384" height="512" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-3.jpg" alt="A group of students standing around a table." class="wp-image-92460" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-3.jpg 384w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-3-188x250.jpg 188w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>They showed that Coolest Projects is not about having everything work perfectly. It’s about showing up, trying something ambitious, and being willing to talk about what went wrong.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why does Coolest Projects matter?</h2>



<p>Coolest Projects goes beyond showcasing technical skills. It helps young people:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Build confidence in presenting ideas</li>



<li>Develop problem-solving and communication skills</li>



<li>See themselves as creators, not just consumers, of technology</li>
</ol>



<p>For many young creators in South Africa, participating in Coolest Projects is a powerful way to gain recognition and see that their ideas matter and that they belong in the world of technology.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="384" height="512" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-6.jpg" alt="A project on a table." class="wp-image-92468" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-6.jpg 384w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-6-188x250.jpg 188w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></figure>

<p>At the end of last year, Professor Becky Francis published her long-awaited <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/curriculum-and-assessment-review-final-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Curriculum and Assessment Review for England</a>, accompanied by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/curriculum-and-assessment-review-final-report-government-response" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK government’s official response</a>. Buried within that response — and not actually proposed in the Review itself — was a notable commitment: to “explore introducing a new Level 3 qualification* in data science and AI, to ensure that more young people can secure high-value skills for the future and that we cement the UK’s position as a global leader in AI and technology.”</p>

<p>This announcement reflects a growing global recognition that young people need more than basic digital literacy — they need a deeper understanding of data, automation, and the rapidly evolving capabilities of AI. Countries around the world, from Singapore to the United States, are already wrestling with how to embed AI education into secondary schooling. England now joins that international conversation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why AI education matters</h2>



<p>AI is an everyday technology now. Young people interact with AI systems constantly, often without realising it. Whether they pursue careers in medicine, engineering, the creative industries, or public policy, they will need a foundational understanding of how AI systems work, what their limitations are, and the ethical implications around them.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1225" height="816" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4.png" alt="A teenager learning computer science." class="wp-image-83499" style="aspect-ratio:1.5012566322256353;width:664px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4.png 1225w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-300x200.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-500x333.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-768x512.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-800x533.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-450x300.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-900x600.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1225px) 100vw, 1225px" /></figure>

<p>Yet in England — and in many education systems globally — very few students receive formal teaching about AI. The English national curriculum makes no explicit reference to AI, and specifications for exams taken at the end of high school include only scattered mentions. This gap leaves young people navigating one of the most transformative technologies of their generation with limited guidance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exploring a qualification: Opportunities and challenges</h2>



<p>In 2025, we joined forces with Professor Lord Lionel Tarassenko, one of the UK’s foremost researchers in AI and machine learning, and Simon Peyton Jones, a world-renowned computer scientist and long-time champion of computing education. Together with teachers, school leaders, universities, industry specialists, and exam boards, we have been exploring how we might begin to close the emerging gap in AI and data science education for 16- to 18-year-olds.</p>

<p>Over the past eight months, this collaboration has allowed us to refine our shared thinking and gather insights from a wide network of experts and practitioners. We are delighted that England&#8217;s Department for Education has recognised the potential of this work by appointing us to draft the subject content for a possible new qualification in Data Science and AI.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Designing a qualification of this kind raises important questions — not just for the UK, but for any country considering a similar path.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What knowledge and skills should young people gain from the qualification?</h3>



<p>A meaningful qualification must go beyond the use of tools. It should help students understand data literacy, model behaviour, bias, ethics, and the societal implications of AI. Balancing technical understanding with critical thinking is challenging but essential.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do we ensure the qualification is accessible and inclusive?</h3>



<p>AI should not become the preserve of already-advantaged students. Any qualification must be designed with equity in mind, recognising differences in school capacity, teacher expertise, and students’ prior experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do we support teachers to deliver the qualification?</h3>



<p>Teacher professional development is a major challenge worldwide. Delivering a qualification in AI will require confidence with concepts that are not yet common in teacher training. Sustainable delivery models — supported by high-quality resources and professional development — will be crucial.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What form should the qualification take?</h3>



<p>There is an active debate about whether the best route for students in England is a high-stakes qualification or a supplementary course that broadens a core programme of study:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An <strong>A level</strong> provides structure, national recognition, and clear progression into higher education or employment.</li>



<li>An <strong>Extended Project Qualification (EPQ)</strong> may offer more flexibility, allowing students to explore AI through research or practical investigation without requiring schools to timetable a full qualification.</li>
</ul>



<p>Different countries will make different choices based on their systems, but the underlying questions are the same: how do we create something rigorous, scalable, and future-proof?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we’ve learned so far</h2>



<p>In October, the Foundation hosted a workshop with representatives from schools, industry, universities, exam boards, and the Department for Education. Together, we explored key questions including:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>How do we make a qualification compelling &#8211; both for students who choose it and for schools that offer it?</strong></li>



<li><strong>What delivery models will genuinely support teachers to succeed?</strong></li>
</ol>

</div>


<p>The feedback we received has been invaluable and will continue to shape the next stage of development. We believe the UK has a significant opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the global conversation about AI education. You can read the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11LEDHgEJLClOeeXScNoypksr1w-1sEXQ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest version of our discussion paper here</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A global call for insights</h2>



<p>Although the current proposal focuses on England, the underlying challenge is international: <strong>how do we prepare young people everywhere to engage thoughtfully and confidently with AI?</strong></p>



<p>We would love to hear from educators, researchers, and policymakers across the world:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Do you know of any successful qualifications or programmes for 16- to 18-year-olds that centre AI or data science?</strong></li>



<li><strong>What lessons should countries learn from each other?</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>To share your ideas or feedback, please <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get in touch</a>. We’d be delighted to learn from your experience as this important work progresses.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>* Level 3 in England is the stage of learning for 16- to 19-year-olds, typically ending in qualifications that pave the way for higher study or advanced apprenticeships.</p>

<p>Traditionally, curriculum planning has often looked like a linear list: Topic A leads to Topic B, which leads to Topic C. However, as educators we know that learning rarely happens in such a simple, linear way. Concepts are regularly covered in different overlapping topics, and students can often take different routes to reach the same destination.</p>

<p>In today’s blog we’re exploring learning graphs, a helpful tool that you can use to plan your computer science curriculum. We’ll share how they can provide educators with a clear, structured way to visualise students’ non-linear progression in a subject.</p>



<p>We also share our new <a href="https://the-cc.io/qr28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pedagogy Quick Read about learning graphs</a>, which you can download for free to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Find practical tips on how you can use learning graphs to design your curriculum</li>



<li>Read a summary of the research behind them</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a learning graph?</h2>



<p>A learning graph is a visual tool for curriculum planning that moves beyond simple lists. At its core, a learning graph is a network of ‘nodes’ (specific concepts and skills) and ‘links’ (the connections between them).</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="227" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-500x227.png" alt="Image from the Learning Graphs Quick Read that showcases an example of a learning graph." class="wp-image-92391" style="width:650px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-500x227.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-300x136.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-768x349.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-800x364.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-450x205.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-900x409.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2.png 1530w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>Learning graphs build on research into ‘<a href="https://www.cpre.org/sites/default/files/researchreport/1220_learningtrajectoriesinmathcciireport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learning progressions</a>’ and ‘knowledge maps’. They are a practical tool that educators can use to design and validate different curricula. For example, they can help teachers to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Visualise and map progression</li>



<li>Identify curriculum gaps, so educators can shape and restructure learning experiences as necessary</li>



<li>Ensure the use of consistent terminology</li>



<li>Sequence learning and manage <a href="https://the-cc.io/qr01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive load</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to create a learning graph</h2>



<p>Building a learning graph is an iterative process that helps you think critically about how different parts of your curriculum relate to each other.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nodes and links</h3>



<p>The first step in creating a learning graph is often to identify your start and end nodes. First, you consider the key concepts and skills that your learners must acquire by the end of a series of lessons. This gives you some end nodes to work towards. Then, you think about learners’ existing knowledge, to help determine your start point. You then work backwards and forwards between these points to identify the different nodes that learners need to cover to get from the beginning to the end.</p>

<p>Once you have determined your nodes, you add them to your graph and connect them via ‘links’ until your graph is complete. Where knowledge of particular concepts or skills is essential for learning others, you connect the nodes with solid lines. For prior learning that is helpful but not essential, you use dotted lines.</p>



<p>When developing a learning graph, there isn’t a specific level of granularity that you have to work towards. Progression can be as detailed or as high-level as you need. This makes them a helpful tool in creating bespoke learning experiences and curricula for learners.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Collaboration and development</h3>



<p>It is most effective to design learning graphs collaboratively within a small group. This allows curriculum designers to discuss their ideas and challenge each other’s thinking, which helps hone the designs.</p>

<p>When creating learning graphs, it can be extremely useful to use a tool that is dynamic and allows you to move elements and make changes quickly and easily. At the Raspberry Pi Foundation, our team has experimented with a range of tools, including using editable shapes in Google Slides, collaborating in Figma, and arranging sticky notes on paper. We recommend finding a tool that works for you and the educators you are working with. Although it can work, we suggest avoiding using a pen and paper if possible, as designs can quickly become messy and difficult to navigate after lots of iterations.</p>



<p>The process of designing learning graphs has strong links to <a href="https://the-cc.io/qr25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC learning design</a> and the creation of <a href="https://the-cc.io/qr07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concept maps</a>, which can also be used for curriculum planning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning graphs in your teaching</h2>



<p>Once created, learning graphs can support you to design and adapt your curricula and assess your students’ learning.</p>



<p>For example, to help sequence learning, you can track or predict the paths through a topic most commonly taken by learners and use this to inform your curriculum design.</p>



<p>If you are adapting a unit of work for a specific qualification or new context, you can prune nodes that are not relevant and add any further knowledge and skills your learners need, then use the new learning graph to guide you as you develop the unit.</p>



<p>Finally, you can assess which node a learner has completed, and use this to identify the next logical step in their learning, ensuring the difficulty level is always appropriate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using learning graphs to support analysis</h2>



<p>Another benefit of learning graphs is that they can be combined with lots of other frameworks, for example, <a href="https://w.wiki/6AK6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloom’s taxonomy</a>. This allows you to better assess and validate the learning journeys you have designed, and ensure that they are suitably accessible, challenging, and relevant for your learners.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways that you could link your learning graphs to other frameworks, such as annotating nodes with extra information, or using colour coding.</p>



<p>As well as working with learning graphs for specific learning experiences, you can connect multiple learning graphs together and analyse how they intersect. This can help identify inconsistencies between connected sequences of lessons. It can also help uncover broader themes of progression and highlight alternative learning pathways you might not have considered.</p>
