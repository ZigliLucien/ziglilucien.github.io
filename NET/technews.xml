<p>The <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raspberry Pi Computing Education Research Centre</a> is starting an exciting new research project investigating how to teach about AI and data in the primary computing classroom, and we would like you to get involved.</p>



<p>The study will look at:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>How AI and data-driven computing is currently taught (e.g. using Machine Learning for Kids, Google’s Teachable Machine)</li>



<li>What key ideas about AI and data that young people need to understand</li>



<li>How young people make sense of working with data in computing</li>
</ul>

</div>



<p>The study involves attending a workshop in Cambridge, co-designing a unit of work, and then teaching it. Where necessary, we can reimburse you for reasonable expenses, such as supply cover, travel, and accommodation.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="2560" height="1709" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_030-scaled.jpg" alt="A teacher assisting a young person with a coding project." class="wp-image-89308" style="aspect-ratio:1.4979937583593401;width:690px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_030-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_030-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_030-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_030-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_030-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_030-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_030-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_030-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_030-900x601.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>Our aim for the study is to understand how primary school teachers approach teaching about data-driven technologies, and to find suitable methods for building young people’s confidence in working with data in computing lessons.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is data-driven computing?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/a-research-led-framework-for-teaching-about-models-in-ai-and-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research has suggested that new data-driven technologies such as AI and machine learning (or ML) require a different approach to teaching about problem-solving</a> in the computing classroom. Instead of defining a set of rules (e.g. if-then-else statements, or a <strong>rule-based</strong> approach), learners must instead collect lots of data to train a model (a <strong>data-driven</strong> approach) such as using Google’s Teachable Machine to classify image data.</p>



<p>For educators and resource developers, we still lack a clear understanding of how to teach young people about how rule-based and data-driven systems differ, how we can talk about them, and how we develop young people’ mental models. We hope this study will help us to find practical ways for primary teachers to build young people’s understanding of AI data in the primary computing classroom.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What does the study involve?</strong></h2>



<p>If you teach at primary level (Years 4, 5 and 6 or P5–P7) in England, Scotland or Wales and are keen to shape how we teach young people about data-driven computing, we invite you to join our new study.</p>

<p>In today’s blog, we explore the PICRAT framework and how it can help you reflect on your use of technology in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We also share our new <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PICRAT Quick Read</a>, which you can download for free to: </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Find practical tips on how to use the PICRAT model when planning your lessons</li>



<li>Read a summary of the research behind the framework</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the PICRAT framework?</strong></h2>



<p>Technology is constantly changing, and educators must continually decide what tools to use in their practice. To help with this challenge, researchers started developing theoretical models that teachers (especially student teachers) could use to reflect on how they integrate technology in their classrooms.</p>



<p>You might already be familiar with frameworks like TPACK (Technology, Pedagogy, and Content Knowledge) and SAMR (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition). While these models are useful, the PICRAT framework was created to address gaps in these earlier models, offering a clearer, student-focused approach. Significantly, it encourages you to treat technology as a tool to support learning, rather than the goal itself.</p>



<p>It asks two simple questions: “How are students experiencing the technology?” and “How does this impact your practice?”. The answers to these questions form a matrix as pictured below.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="288" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/PICRAT-Matrix-500x288.png" alt="" class="wp-image-92497" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/PICRAT-Matrix-500x288.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/PICRAT-Matrix-300x173.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/PICRAT-Matrix-450x259.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/PICRAT-Matrix.png 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>PIC (which runs along the y-axis) refers to the student&#8217;s relationship to the technology:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Passive – Students receive learning through technology</li>



<li>Interactive – Students interact with the content or other learning through technology </li>



<li>Creative – Students construct knowledge using technology</li>
</ul>



<p>RAT (which runs along the x-axis) refers to how the teacher uses the technology:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Replaces – Using technology but with an existing pedagogy</li>



<li>Amplifies – Using technology to improve pedagogy or outcomes</li>



<li>Transforms – Using technology to create new pedagogical practices</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How can I apply the PICRAT model?</strong></h2>



<p>First choose the lesson you’re planning to deliver. Consider what activities you’ll be running and the technologies involved. You’ll then be able to plot where they sit on the matrix using the PICRAT acronym.</p>



<p>For example, if you are teaching a lesson on Python loops, you might initially plan for students to watch a pre-recorded coding tutorial on their laptops. In this scenario, the student experience is Passive (receiving info via tech), and the teacher&#8217;s use is Replacement because the video simply replaces a live lecture. To move up the matrix, you could instead have students use an online IDE to complete a &#8220;Parson’s Problem&#8221; puzzle where they rearrange blocks of code to fix a loop. This shifts the activity to Interactive and Amplification, as the digital tool provides immediate debugging feedback that a paper-based exercise could not.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="288" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/Educator-Presenting-Clubs-Conference-2023-500x288.png" alt="Educator presenting in a classroom." class="wp-image-92500" style="width:552px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/Educator-Presenting-Clubs-Conference-2023-500x288.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/Educator-Presenting-Clubs-Conference-2023-300x173.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/Educator-Presenting-Clubs-Conference-2023-450x259.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/Educator-Presenting-Clubs-Conference-2023.png 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>Next, think about how you might move your practice forwards. Although every position on the matrix has its own value, the framework is hierarchical. The overall goal is to try to move your practice towards the top right of the matrix to be Creative and Transformative.</p>



<p>To help you achieve this, take some time to reflect on your current lessons, activities, and the technologies you use. Ask yourself questions like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What does the technology I’m using offer that could be used to amplify my practice?
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What benefits would this have for students?</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Does the technology present opportunities for students to interact with each other, not just the technology?</li>



<li>What other technological tools might support collaboration? </li>
</ul>



<p>Research highlights that technology is rarely used in ways that allow young people to be creative. By using the PICRAT matrix, teachers can identify missed opportunities and explore ways to transform their lessons, ensuring learners can be creative and thrive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The benefits of the PICRAT model</strong></h2>



<p>Potential benefits for educators:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The framework encourages meaningful reflections, allowing teachers to easily evaluate how they’re using technology within their lessons</li>



<li>Reflections and the PICRAT matrix helps teachers to identify missed opportunities and gaps in their practice, ultimately leading to better student experiences</li>
</ul>

<p>Coolest Projects is the world’s leading technology showcase for young people, a space where creativity, curiosity, and problem-solving come together through code. Last November, <a href="https://online.coolestprojects.org/">Coolest Projects</a> returned to South Africa, providing another exciting opportunity to celebrate and amplify the voices of young digital creators across Mzansi, a local name for South Africa.</p>

<p>Coolest Projects brings young people together to share what excites them the most about creating with technology, whether that&#8217;s making a game, a website, a robot, or a simple Scratch animation. What matters most is not perfection, but participation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A showcase for young makers</h2>



<p>Coolest Projects, an initiative of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, is brought to South Africa by our long-standing partner <a href="https://coderlevelup.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coder:LevelUp</a>, giving young people the space to share how they get creative with technology.</p>



<p>I spent the day surrounded by young people explaining their ideas with a mix of excitement, nerves, and confidence — the kind of emotions you get when you build something yourself and someone is finally asking you about it.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="384" height="512" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-2.jpg" alt="A group of people standing around a table." class="wp-image-92463" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-2.jpg 384w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-2-188x250.jpg 188w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>The event brought together over 250 young people to share the projects they had been working on. Some had been preparing for months, while others had begun exploring their ideas more recently. All of them arrived ready to explain what they made, how it worked, and what they would do differently next time.</p>



<p>There wasn&#8217;t a single kind of project. There was a Scratch animation at one table, a game at the next, and a hardware project across the room. Some projects were polished, others rougher around the edges. But the event isn’t about perfection, it&#8217;s about learning and having the courage to show your work.</p>



<p>For a lot of participants, this was the first time they had presented their work to an audience, and you could see their confidence build as they spoke. By the end of the day, many were already talking about what they wanted to build next! From experience, we know that many of these young people will come back to Coolest Projects in the future, with our <a href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/coolestprojects/Coolest_Projects_2025_impact_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global impact data</a> showing that over 1 in 10 participants in the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/coolest-projects-2025-where-11980-young-tech-creators-shared-their-ideas/">Coolest Projects online showcase in 2025</a> had also taken part in Coolest Projects in 2024.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The coolest projects and the coolest people</h2>



<p>One of my favourite things about Coolest Projects is that although you might come for the projects, what stays with you is often the people behind them. Coolest Projects celebrates both what young people build and who they are becoming.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The coolest projects</h3>



<p>A project that really stood out to me was created by a group of girls who built a language app that translates words from isiZulu, one of South Africa’s official languages, into French and other languages — an ambitious and thoughtful idea.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-5-500x375.jpg" alt="A group of students looking at a computer screen." class="wp-image-92467" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-5-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-5-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-5.jpg 512w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>What made this project especially meaningful to me was how well it reflected South Africa’s identity as a rainbow nation, with 12 official languages and countless cultures intersecting everyday. Their work wasn&#8217;t just technical, it was deeply relevant. It showed how young creators are already thinking about inclusion, communication, and using technology to bridge the gap between people in different parts of the country. Seeing these young girls confidently present such a culturally aware solution was incredibly inspiring.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">And the coolest people</h3>



<p>A group of boys arrived with a project that, honestly, fell apart on the day. Things didn’t work the way they had planned. But instead of shutting down or panicking, they laughed it off, explained what should have happened, and kept the energy positive. Their confidence, humour, and teamwork were great to see.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="384" height="512" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-3.jpg" alt="A group of students standing around a table." class="wp-image-92460" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-3.jpg 384w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-3-188x250.jpg 188w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>They showed that Coolest Projects is not about having everything work perfectly. It’s about showing up, trying something ambitious, and being willing to talk about what went wrong.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why does Coolest Projects matter?</h2>



<p>Coolest Projects goes beyond showcasing technical skills. It helps young people:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Build confidence in presenting ideas</li>



<li>Develop problem-solving and communication skills</li>



<li>See themselves as creators, not just consumers, of technology</li>
</ol>



<p>For many young creators in South Africa, participating in Coolest Projects is a powerful way to gain recognition and see that their ideas matter and that they belong in the world of technology.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="384" height="512" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-6.jpg" alt="A project on a table." class="wp-image-92468" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-6.jpg 384w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/02/unnamed-6-188x250.jpg 188w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>We look forward to Coolest Projects South Africa returning in 2026 to once again showcase the incredible potential of young tech creators across the country.</p>

<p>At the end of last year, Professor Becky Francis published her long-awaited <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/curriculum-and-assessment-review-final-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Curriculum and Assessment Review for England</a>, accompanied by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/curriculum-and-assessment-review-final-report-government-response" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UK government’s official response</a>. Buried within that response — and not actually proposed in the Review itself — was a notable commitment: to “explore introducing a new Level 3 qualification* in data science and AI, to ensure that more young people can secure high-value skills for the future and that we cement the UK’s position as a global leader in AI and technology.”</p>

<p>This announcement reflects a growing global recognition that young people need more than basic digital literacy — they need a deeper understanding of data, automation, and the rapidly evolving capabilities of AI. Countries around the world, from Singapore to the United States, are already wrestling with how to embed AI education into secondary schooling. England now joins that international conversation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why AI education matters</h2>



<p>AI is an everyday technology now. Young people interact with AI systems constantly, often without realising it. Whether they pursue careers in medicine, engineering, the creative industries, or public policy, they will need a foundational understanding of how AI systems work, what their limitations are, and the ethical implications around them.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>Yet in England — and in many education systems globally — very few students receive formal teaching about AI. The English national curriculum makes no explicit reference to AI, and specifications for exams taken at the end of high school include only scattered mentions. This gap leaves young people navigating one of the most transformative technologies of their generation with limited guidance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exploring a qualification: Opportunities and challenges</h2>



<p>In 2025, we joined forces with Professor Lord Lionel Tarassenko, one of the UK’s foremost researchers in AI and machine learning, and Simon Peyton Jones, a world-renowned computer scientist and long-time champion of computing education. Together with teachers, school leaders, universities, industry specialists, and exam boards, we have been exploring how we might begin to close the emerging gap in AI and data science education for 16- to 18-year-olds.</p>

<p>Over the past eight months, this collaboration has allowed us to refine our shared thinking and gather insights from a wide network of experts and practitioners. We are delighted that England&#8217;s Department for Education has recognised the potential of this work by appointing us to draft the subject content for a possible new qualification in Data Science and AI.</p>

<p>We are delighted that England&#8217;s Department for Education has recognised the potential of [the work we&#8217;ve been doing] by appointing us to draft the subject content for a possible new qualification in Data Science and AI.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Designing a qualification of this kind raises important questions — not just for the UK, but for any country considering a similar path.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What knowledge and skills should young people gain from the qualification?</h3>



<p>A meaningful qualification must go beyond the use of tools. It should help students understand data literacy, model behaviour, bias, ethics, and the societal implications of AI. Balancing technical understanding with critical thinking is challenging but essential.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do we ensure the qualification is accessible and inclusive?</h3>



<p>AI should not become the preserve of already-advantaged students. Any qualification must be designed with equity in mind, recognising differences in school capacity, teacher expertise, and students’ prior experience.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How do we support teachers to deliver the qualification?</h3>



<p>Teacher professional development is a major challenge worldwide. Delivering a qualification in AI will require confidence with concepts that are not yet common in teacher training. Sustainable delivery models — supported by high-quality resources and professional development — will be crucial.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What form should the qualification take?</h3>



<p>There is an active debate about whether the best route for students in England is a high-stakes qualification or a supplementary course that broadens a core programme of study:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An <strong>A level</strong> provides structure, national recognition, and clear progression into higher education or employment.</li>



<li>An <strong>Extended Project Qualification (EPQ)</strong> may offer more flexibility, allowing students to explore AI through research or practical investigation without requiring schools to timetable a full qualification.</li>
</ul>



<p>Different countries will make different choices based on their systems, but the underlying questions are the same: how do we create something rigorous, scalable, and future-proof?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we’ve learned so far</h2>



<p>In October, the Foundation hosted a workshop with representatives from schools, industry, universities, exam boards, and the Department for Education. Together, we explored key questions including:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>How do we make a qualification compelling &#8211; both for students who choose it and for schools that offer it?</strong></li>



<li><strong>What delivery models will genuinely support teachers to succeed?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The feedback we received has been invaluable and will continue to shape the next stage of development. We believe the UK has a significant opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the global conversation about AI education. You can read the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11LEDHgEJLClOeeXScNoypksr1w-1sEXQ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest version of our discussion paper here</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A global call for insights</h2>



<p>Although the current proposal focuses on England, the underlying challenge is international: <strong>how do we prepare young people everywhere to engage thoughtfully and confidently with AI?</strong></p>



<p>We would love to hear from educators, researchers, and policymakers across the world:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Do you know of any successful qualifications or programmes for 16- to 18-year-olds that centre AI or data science?</strong></li>



<li><strong>What lessons should countries learn from each other?</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>To share your ideas or feedback, please <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get in touch</a>. We’d be delighted to learn from your experience as this important work progresses.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>* Level 3 in England is the stage of learning for 16- to 19-year-olds, typically ending in qualifications that pave the way for higher study or advanced apprenticeships.</p>

<p>Traditionally, curriculum planning has often looked like a linear list: Topic A leads to Topic B, which leads to Topic C. However, as educators we know that learning rarely happens in such a simple, linear way. Concepts are regularly covered in different overlapping topics, and students can often take different routes to reach the same destination.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is a learning graph?</h2>



<p>A learning graph is a visual tool for curriculum planning that moves beyond simple lists. At its core, a learning graph is a network of ‘nodes’ (specific concepts and skills) and ‘links’ (the connections between them).</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="227" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-500x227.png" alt="Image from the Learning Graphs Quick Read that showcases an example of a learning graph." class="wp-image-92391" style="width:650px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-500x227.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-300x136.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-768x349.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-800x364.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-450x205.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2-900x409.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-2.png 1530w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>Learning graphs build on research into ‘<a href="https://www.cpre.org/sites/default/files/researchreport/1220_learningtrajectoriesinmathcciireport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learning progressions</a>’ and ‘knowledge maps’. They are a practical tool that educators can use to design and validate different curricula. For example, they can help teachers to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Visualise and map progression</li>



<li>Identify curriculum gaps, so educators can shape and restructure learning experiences as necessary</li>



<li>Ensure the use of consistent terminology</li>



<li>Sequence learning and manage <a href="https://the-cc.io/qr01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive load</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to create a learning graph</h2>



<p>Building a learning graph is an iterative process that helps you think critically about how different parts of your curriculum relate to each other.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Nodes and links</h3>



<p>The first step in creating a learning graph is often to identify your start and end nodes. First, you consider the key concepts and skills that your learners must acquire by the end of a series of lessons. This gives you some end nodes to work towards. Then, you think about learners’ existing knowledge, to help determine your start point. You then work backwards and forwards between these points to identify the different nodes that learners need to cover to get from the beginning to the end.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image3-500x333.jpg" alt="Educators sharing ideas around a table." class="wp-image-92392" style="width:617px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image3-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image3-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image3-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image3.jpg 1999w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>Once you have determined your nodes, you add them to your graph and connect them via ‘links’ until your graph is complete. Where knowledge of particular concepts or skills is essential for learning others, you connect the nodes with solid lines. For prior learning that is helpful but not essential, you use dotted lines.</p>



<p>When developing a learning graph, there isn’t a specific level of granularity that you have to work towards. Progression can be as detailed or as high-level as you need. This makes them a helpful tool in creating bespoke learning experiences and curricula for learners.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Collaboration and development</h3>



<p>It is most effective to design learning graphs collaboratively within a small group. This allows curriculum designers to discuss their ideas and challenge each other’s thinking, which helps hone the designs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1311" height="874" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-1-edited-1.jpg" alt="Educators collaborating using post-it notes, planning currciulum." class="wp-image-92395" style="width:683px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-1-edited-1.jpg 1311w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-1-edited-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-1-edited-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-1-edited-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-1-edited-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-1-edited-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-1-edited-1-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1311px) 100vw, 1311px" /></figure>



<p>When creating learning graphs, it can be extremely useful to use a tool that is dynamic and allows you to move elements and make changes quickly and easily. At the Raspberry Pi Foundation, our team has experimented with a range of tools, including using editable shapes in Google Slides, collaborating in Figma, and arranging sticky notes on paper. We recommend finding a tool that works for you and the educators you are working with. Although it can work, we suggest avoiding using a pen and paper if possible, as designs can quickly become messy and difficult to navigate after lots of iterations.</p>



<p>The process of designing learning graphs has strong links to <a href="https://the-cc.io/qr25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC learning design</a> and the creation of <a href="https://the-cc.io/qr07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concept maps</a>, which can also be used for curriculum planning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning graphs in your teaching</h2>



<p>Once created, learning graphs can support you to design and adapt your curricula and assess your students’ learning.</p>



<p>For example, to help sequence learning, you can track or predict the paths through a topic most commonly taken by learners and use this to inform your curriculum design.</p>



<p>If you are adapting a unit of work for a specific qualification or new context, you can prune nodes that are not relevant and add any further knowledge and skills your learners need, then use the new learning graph to guide you as you develop the unit.</p>



<p>Finally, you can assess which node a learner has completed, and use this to identify the next logical step in their learning, ensuring the difficulty level is always appropriate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using learning graphs to support analysis</h2>



<p>Another benefit of learning graphs is that they can be combined with lots of other frameworks, for example, <a href="https://w.wiki/6AK6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloom’s taxonomy</a>. This allows you to better assess and validate the learning journeys you have designed, and ensure that they are suitably accessible, challenging, and relevant for your learners.</p>

</div>


<p>There are a number of ways that you could link your learning graphs to other frameworks, such as annotating nodes with extra information, or using colour coding.</p>



<p>As well as working with learning graphs for specific learning experiences, you can connect multiple learning graphs together and analyse how they intersect. This can help identify inconsistencies between connected sequences of lessons. It can also help uncover broader themes of progression and highlight alternative learning pathways you might not have considered.</p>

<p>In November, our first-ever Kenya Partner Showcase brought together all our partners from across the country for two days of collaboration, learning, and shared strategy. What stood out to us most from the event was not just the diversity of work that the Kenyan partners are doing in computing education, but also the clear alignment that is emerging across partners, government, and communities.</p>

</div>


<p>Partners used the Showcase to present sessions about their journeys implementing the Foundation’s programmes, sharing achievements and insights that strengthened the collective learning space. The conversations during our two days together reflected a maturing ecosystem and demonstrated how structured government buy-in is accelerating adoption of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/adapting-our-computing-curriculum-resources-for-kenya-the-journey-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our localised Computing Curriculum</a> and influencing national policy spaces.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Through these programmes, we are equipping young people to become future-ready leaders of integrity and impact.” – Betty Oloo Anderson, National Executive Officer, Kenya Girl Guides Association</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was encouraging to see how far computing education has evolved since we began working with Kenyan partners in 2023, signalling the collective effort and commitment driving this work forward.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Partner-led sessions to reflect on what works</h2>



<p>The sessions revealed a powerful shift already taking place in classrooms, with partners demonstrating how embedding The Computing Curriculum into Teacher Professional Development frameworks is building teacher confidence and elevating the quality of classroom instruction through stronger digital competencies and culturally relevant pedagogy. The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/impact-of-experience-ai-in-kenya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partner presentation on Experience AI</a>, our <a href="https://experience-ai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI literacy programme</a>, was especially powerful. It reframed the national dialogue from questioning whether AI might take over the classroom to recognising the real capacities and limitations of AI tools, and the central role teachers play in guiding young people to use and create AI tools in safe, ethical ways.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Running Raspberry Pi Foundation programmes has been a transformative journey. It has challenged us to innovate, document rigorously, and continually place learners at the center of every decision. The structured support, tools, and community of practice have enabled us to deliver programmes with greater impact and accountability.” Joel Kahindi, Programme Coordinator, STEAMLabs Africa</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hands-on demonstrations, from physical computing with Raspberry Pi Pico to teacher development transitions from Scratch to Python, highlighted how practical computing is taking root in both formal and non-formal learning environments.</p>

<p>Partners from remote and underserved regions shared how locally contextualised computing tools and programmes we offer are reaching learners in ASAL (arid and semi-arid land) regions, strengthening literacy and digital confidence even in low-resource settings. Complementing this, curriculum-focused partners highlighted how structured computing resources are being adapted for ASAL contexts, reinforcing foundational skills at scale. Efforts around community-centred connectivity are enabling schools, especially in underserved communities, to finally access reliable high-speed internet.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Through [our partnership with the Raspberry Pi Foundation], we are not only strengthening our programmes but also expanding our vision for what meaningful learning can look like across underserved communities.” – Joel Kahindi, Programme Coordinator, STEAMLabs Africa</p>

</div>


<p>A notable pattern that emerged was how existing collaborations are now opening doors to new ones, with partners building on their relationship with us to form additional partnerships for devices, connectivity, and shared learning, creating a more holistic digital ecosystem for learners.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Solving shared problems, sharing real stories</h2>



<p>A major anchor of the Showcase was the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/celebrating-impact-code-clubs-are-thriving-in-kenya-and-south-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Club</a> co-creation sprint. Implementing partners worked through real barriers and opportunities: easier onboarding for educators, continuous training, integrating clubs into school calendars, learner-led ownership, and sustainable models that last beyond donor funding. There was strong interest in forming a unified Code Club Kenya partner network to streamline communication, resource-sharing, and visibility, and our team is now exploring what it would take to bring this to life.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2000" height="1333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0720.jpg" alt="A speaker at the Raspberry Pi Foundation's Kenya Partner Showcase 2025, smiling and holding a microphone." class="wp-image-92356" style="aspect-ratio:1.500418643594753;width:700px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0720.jpg 2000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0720-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0720-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0720-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0720-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0720-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0720-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0720-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>One message echoed across sessions: the power of telling real stories. Partners expressed a shared desire to spotlight creator projects, Code Club leader journeys, and regional experiences more consistently, through social media, case studies and impact stories, and shared platforms, to make progress visible and inspire more schools to adopt computing and digital skills.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">From isolation to coordination</h2>



<p>By the close of the Showcase, the takeaway was clear: Kenya’s digital learning ecosystem is no longer a set of isolated efforts — it is a coordinated network that shares priorities, evidence-based insights, and a commitment to scaling impact together. As one partner reflected, “This Showcase created a space for joint learning and will help us scale our impact across the country.” It felt evident, too, that bringing these voices into one room is itself part of the work. For us at the Foundation, this Showcase reaffirmed the responsibility and privilege of stewarding a network that is shaping what the future of learning computing in Kenya can look like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In Germany, <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/projects/computer-science-education-around-the-world/">as in many countries</a>, AI topics are rapidly entering formal computer science education. Yet, this haste often risks us focusing on fleeting technological developments rather than fundamental concepts. As computer science educator Viktoriya Olari, from Free University of Berlin, discovered in her research, the fundamental role of data, which powers most modern AI systems, is critically underestimated in many existing frameworks. If students are to become responsible designers of such systems, they can&#8217;t afford to treat AI as an opaque box. Rather, they must first master the messy, human process that begins with the data itself.</p>

<p>In our October research seminar, Viktoriya shared the results of her work over the last four years on how schools can shift the focus from the latest technologies to the underlying data. Her research offers a clear structure for what young people should learn about data and how teachers can make it work inside ordinary classrooms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why begin with data?</h2>



<p>Viktoriya’s analysis of existing AI education frameworks found the data domain is underrepresented, with essentials such as data cleaning often not addressed at all. She argues that, because modern AI systems are data driven, students need both language and routines for working with data: being able to name concepts like <strong>training vs test data</strong>, <strong>data quality</strong>, and <strong>bias</strong>, and to explain practices such as <strong>collection</strong>, <strong>cleaning</strong>, and <strong>pre-processing</strong>. That’s the rationale for teaching data concepts and practices first, and then placing modelling inside an explicit, staged lifecycle.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image4.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1906" height="1070" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image4.png" alt="Word clouds for two foundational components: data concepts and data practices." class="wp-image-92328" style="aspect-ratio:1.7813121272365806;width:696px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image4.png 1906w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image4-300x168.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image4-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image4-768x431.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image4-1536x862.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image4-800x449.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image4-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image4-900x505.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1906px) 100vw, 1906px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A slide from Viktoriya&#8217;s presentation.

<p>Her talk presented this argument in the German school context, where AI topics are entering state curricula quickly. Her critique targets how existing frameworks fail to address data and how that gap undermines responsible evaluation and design. The proposed model centres data by pairing an eight-stage, data-driven lifecycle with a curated set of key concepts and practices, and by making “data-based judgment skills” a key outcome.</p>



<p>Viktoriya&#8217;s work organises this understanding into two foundational components: data concepts (the vocabulary, e.g. training/test data, data quality, overfitting) and data practices (the actions, e.g. collect, clean, train, evaluate).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A lifecycle for learning</h2>



<p>Viktoriya’s framework is built around an eight-stage data lifecycle, stretching from defining a task through gathering, preparing, modeling, evaluating, and finally sharing or archiving results. Inside that backbone she has identified two layers of learning targets:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Data concepts – roughly a hundred ideas that give teachers and students a common language, from “training vs. test data” and “bias” to “features”, “labels”, and “provenance”.</li>



<li>Data practices – 28 kinds of hands-on work (and 69 subpractices) that materialise those ideas: for instance collecting, cleaning, splitting datasets, checking quality, training and evaluating models, and handling privacy and deletion responsibly.</li>
</ul>



<p>More details are available in her work on data-related <a href="https://computingeducation.de/pub/2024_Olari-Romeike_Computers_Education_Open.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concepts</a> and <a href="https://computingeducation.de/pub/2024_Olari-Romeike_WiPSCE2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">practice</a>.</p>

<p>A collection of 133 key data-related concepts. These concepts are organised according to the eight stages of the data-driven lifecycle and provide the foundational vocabulary for teaching AI education.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Making it teachable</h2>



<p>Viktoriya’s team set out to redesign the format so that real data work could happen within ordinary lessons. They ended up with three “<a href="https://computingeducation.de/pub/2025_Olari-Romeike_CompEd25.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Case Study</a>” architectures, each using authentic datasets and domain questions. The materials are supported by <a href="https://orangedatamining.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orange 3</a>, an unplugged machine learning and data visualisations tool familiar to the teachers participating. Variants emerged across three design cycles to address specific challenges, but teachers choose among them based on learning objectives and class context.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Bottom-up: Students create a workflow step by step (e.g. import, inspect, clean, transform, split, train, evaluate). This approach is excellent for procedural fluency, but teachers reported an over-emphasis on operating <em>Orange</em> and too little reflection on the lifecycle unless explicit reflection is added.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Top-down: Students start from a prepared workflow, read plots, infer the role of each branch, identify issues in the data/practices, and justify changes. This architecture directly counters the reflection gap seen in bottom-up and leans into reasoning rather than routine.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Puzzle-like: Using “widgets,” visualisations of data tables, that stand for parts of a data pipeline, students rebuild a valid flow collaboratively. This encourages discussion, works without devices, and makes thinking visible.</li>
</ol>

</div>


<p>The data case study method uses real-world data and context to help students achieve three key learning outcomes: go through the data-driven lifecycle, reflect on data practices and concepts in a criteria-guided manner, and develop data-based problem-solving and judgment skills.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What happened in the German classrooms</h2>



<p>Viktoriya’s team ran three design cycles with small groups in Germany, with students aged 14 to 15. Each cycle lasted around 48 hours of teaching. Because participating teachers already knew Orange 3, the emphasis was on pedagogy rather than software training.</p>



<p>The projects drew on manageable real-world data: spreadsheets, time-series sets, a few geographical samples. Two examples are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Forecasting Berlin air quality – Students explored how data quality, feature choice, and evaluation metrics shape predictions, then argued which model best answered the civic question.</li>



<li>Classifying Tasmanian abalone – A deceptively simple dataset that invites talk about imbalance, feature engineering, and what counts as “good enough” accuracy.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some groups experimented with collecting their own sensor data, a plan that occasionally failed when the hardware didn’t cooperate. However, even that became part of the lesson: reliability, risk, and missing data are real features of data science, not mistakes to hide.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1132" height="755" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1058.jpg" alt="A computing classroom filled with learners" class="wp-image-32214" style="aspect-ratio:1.4993724724585134;width:738px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1058.jpg 1132w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1058-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1058-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1058-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1058-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1058-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/05/IMG_1058-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1132px) 100vw, 1132px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>Student work reflected the three architectures. In the bottom-up groups, guided builds produced complete workflows and concise reflections, while top-down groups submitted annotated screenshots and critiques, and the puzzle-based lessons ended with posters and verbal presentations. Across them all, assessment focused on reasoning: not whether the “right” model appeared, but whether students could explain the stage they were in and justify their choices.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Teaching resources</h2>



<p>Everything Viktoriya described is open and classroom-ready (currently in German). The <a href="https://computingeducation.de/proj-datacases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">computingeducation.de/proj-datacases</a> hub hosts teacher guides, student tasks, and sample Orange 3 files. The growing library of data cases covers topics from climate data to air quality analytics.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why it matters now</h2>



<p>In the UK, a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/690b96bbc22e4ed8b051854d/Curriculum_and_Assessment_Review_final_report_-_Building_a_world-class_curriculum_for_all.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">curriculum review</a> has been recently released and along with the Government’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/690b2a4a14b040dfe82922ea/Government_response_to_the_Curriculum_and_Assessment_Review.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response</a>. Across Europe and beyond, education systems are racing to add AI content to their curricula. Tools will come and go, and benchmarks will keep moving. What endures is the capacity to reason about data: to know what stage of work you’re in, what evidence supports your decisions, and what trade-offs you’re making. That is why Viktoriya&#8217;s contribution is unique — it gives teachers a map, a shared vocabulary, and practical ways to make data visible and the focus of discussion in schools.</p>

<li>What key ideas pupils need to understand</li>



<li>How teachers currently approach topics related to data-driven computing</li>



<li>How pupils make sense of data and probability</li>
</ul>



<p>Our goal is to find practical ways to help teachers build children’s confidence in working with data in computing lessons. The study will be collaborative, with two workshops held throughout 2026, and we’re inviting KS2 teachers (Y4/Y5/Y6) to take part.<br>You can express your interest in participating by filling in this form: <a href="https://rpf.io/data-science-study-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rpf.io/data-science-study-blog</a></p>

<p>Coolest Projects is our global technology showcase for young people up to age 18. It’s a place where young creators share the brilliant things they’ve made using digital technology — from first-ever Scratch projects and coding for fun<strong> </strong>experiments to ambitious robotics builds — with a global audience. Everyone who takes part receives certificates and rewards to celebrate their achievements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What you need to know about Coolest Projects 2026</h2>



<p>Coolest Projects is open to any young person, anywhere in the world. Creators can submit their tech projects to our online showcase, explore the <a href="https://rpf.io/cp-25-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global project gallery</a>, and join our special celebration livestream. There are in-person events in some countries for local creators, too (find out more below).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Group codes for mentors entering multiple projects online</h2>



<p>If you’re entering several projects on behalf of your group, you can create a <strong>group code</strong> to link young people’s projects to your account.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick reminder of how it works:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sign up or log in:</strong> Use your Raspberry Pi account or create a new one.</li>



<li><strong>Create a group:</strong> Add your group details, including name and country.</li>



<li><strong>Share your group code:</strong> Young people enter the code on their project submission form.</li>



<li><strong>Review and submit:</strong> View all linked projects in your group dashboard.</li>
</ul>



<p>There is no limit to the number of young people who can submit through one group code.</p>



<p>If you’d like a full walkthrough, watch our step-by-step group code <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngYHRTzbDHI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘how-to’ video</a>.</p>



<p>Whether your coders are beginners or experienced digital makers, there are lots of resources to support them. Visit the <a href="https://online.coolestprojects.org/guidance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coolest Projects guidance page</a> for mentor guides, session plans, and more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Coolest Projects in-person events in 2026</h2>

<p>Every week, young people around the world gather in libraries, classrooms, community centres, and makerspaces to create with code. From Gujarat to Glasgow, Nairobi to New Jersey, the settings may differ, but the energy is unmistakable.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1333" height="889" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9862.jpg" alt="Code Club meeting at the shared hub at AEF Reuben in Kenya" class="wp-image-92271" style="aspect-ratio:1.4994561124592085;width:734px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9862.jpg 1333w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9862-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9862-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9862-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9862-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9862-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9862-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1333px) 100vw, 1333px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Code Club meeting at the shared hub at AEF Reuben in Kenya</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>We set out to learn from the wealth of experiences within the global Code Club community: how clubs adapt to local needs, and which practices consistently support young people’s learning. Although we found small differences in how clubs make Code Club work locally, what stands out far more are the shared principles that make it work everywhere. Here we share stories from across our network that collectively paint a vibrant picture of what makes this movement work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Inspiration from the people who make Code Club thrive</h2>



<p>One theme runs through every story: Code Club is powered by people who really understand the needs of <strong>their</strong> community.</p>



<p>During a visit to a set of Code Clubs in India, our team met a group of girls who once faced barriers to attending school. Now, they are confidently creating Scratch projects and exploring new technologies. Their club leader explained how a simple change — allowing girls to attend school wearing traditional attire — opened doors for families. Seeing these young creators code with pride is a vivid reminder of how opportunity can reshape futures.</p>

<p>A club leader at Better Juniors Digital Club at Better Life Primary and Junior School in Kenya described how their programme began with just one laptop. Rather than letting that limit what learners could do, he found solutions everywhere: applying for grants, borrowing digital space from a nearby hub, and setting up equipment so children could work on projects together. His determination effectively created a bridge between schools and resources, opening up real opportunities for every child to learn.</p>



<p>We also heard from educators whose clubs have become long-standing pillars of their communities. At Rhiwbina Library in Wales, leaders have been running Code Club for over a decade, creating a space where older creators naturally guide new ones. When asked about club rules, one child replied: “There’s only one and that’s ‘respect’.” That simple principle continues to shape a joyful, collaborative atmosphere.</p>

<p>And sometimes the inspiration comes from the young people themselves. At Hillside Primary in Scotland, an enthusiastic creator took it upon himself to run taster sessions and codealongs for new members, helping them discover whether Code Club was right for them. His enthusiasm and leadership were infectious, and that spirit of young people lifting up their peers is something we’ve seen in clubs all over the world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Moments of joyful learning capture the spirit of Code Club</h2>



<p>In one club that meets across three different venues in Pennsylvania, USA — a creative arts centre, a coffee shop, and a library — the excitement became contagious. The librarian, Miss Sandy, was so inspired by the learners’ projects — including the moment they added “Shredder Cat”, the library’s pet mascot, into their digital creations — that she has begun learning to code alongside them.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>At one showcase event in India, learners proudly demonstrated text-to-speech and video-sensing projects — remarkable achievements for many of them in their first year of coding. They explained their ideas with confidence and clarity, sharing the logic behind their work as parents, teachers, and mentors looked on with pride.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the UK, we experienced a beautiful moment at Fakenham Academy where the room filled with a chorus of squarks, clicking, tapping, and squeaking sounds as learners adapted the <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/grow-a-dragonfly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grow a Dragonfly</a> project in their own creative ways.</p>



<p>From applause erupting whenever a project is finished to a room buzzing with micro:bits or young people debugging together on a shared laptop, these snapshots show Code Club at its best.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">All about community: <strong>Belonging, identity, and a resourceful spirit</strong></h2>



<p>Whatever the context or setting, Code Club leaders are resourceful. They are not waiting for others to solve their challenges; together with their creators, they are finding local solutions that work. Communities share equipment, mentor each other, offer space, and build continuity for learners in imaginative ways. Young people are gaining far more than digital skills: they are developing belonging, confidence, and a clear sense that they are part of something bigger.</p>



<p>For example, in a club in Kenya, two groups learnt side by side in a shared space. Younger learners were welcomed by older peers who acted as mentors, creating a real sense of community — collaborative, vibrant, and full of pride in each other’s achievements.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="625" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/1-1-500x625.png" alt="Learners at a Code Club at Oasis Mathare in Kenya " class="wp-image-86862" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/1-1-500x625.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/1-1-200x250.png 200w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/1-1-768x960.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/1-1-800x1000.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/1-1-450x562.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/1-1-900x1125.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/1-1.png 945w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Code Club at Oasis Mathare in Kenya </figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>We also saw how deeply this work is woven into people’s identities. One team member visiting three clubs in Malvern, UK, wrote about Bob Bilsland, a Code Club champion for 13 years, describing how naturally he connected with learners at their own level and how fully he embodied the role of mentor and champion:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Seeing his versatility as he mentored, sparked excitement and connected with creators at their own level was a thing to behold… he truly walks the talk.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The impact can sometimes show up in unexpected ways. Holly, a leader from Illinois, USA, shared that her learners wear their Code Club t-shirts to school as “spirit gear” on Fridays. She told us how much this meant to her students: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“They absolutely love their shirts and are thrilled to be able to wear them… It makes them feel like a team.” A reminder that belonging matters just as much as skills.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Across every example, we saw resilience, creativity, and generosity in action because Code Clubs grow from strong communities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Locally rooted but globally informed</h2>



<p>These stories underscore something essential: Code Club grows not because of any one model, but because communities everywhere make it their own. Sandra Keeru, Programme Coordinator in Kenya, put it beautifully when she reflected that: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Code Club is locally rooted but globally informed.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Each club reflects the needs, culture, and creativity of its community, yet everywhere the same shared values shine through: curiosity, inclusion, and the belief that young people can achieve remarkable things.</p>



<p>Code Club is more than just learning to code; it’s about creating opportunities, encouraging confidence, and building a global network of digital creators. Whether you’re a mentor, educator, or young digital maker, there’s a place for you in the community. <a href="https://codeclub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Start your Code Club</a> journey today and join a global community of digital creators.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that for the last few years our focus has been on AI technology, and for 2026 we will continue this. But we will shift from showcasing how computing education research is changing teaching and learning in computing lessons, to showcasing how computing education research in other disciplines, such as art or geography, is starting to include teaching about AI. For example, art lessons may change so that learners find out how professional artists are using AI tools to create arts. Or geography lessons may change so that learners discover how professional geographers are using AI to make predictions about physical or human aspects of geography, such as volcanic activity and global warming.</p>



<p>Our series for 2026 is called <strong>&#8216;Applied AI&#8217;</strong>. This title recognises that AI technology is applied across contexts, across careers, across disciplines, and this means what we teach across school subjects will change.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Encouraging a pull from disciplines, rather than a push from computer science</h2>



<p>The majority of resources and professional development material related to teaching about AI have been developed by the computer science community. For example, we have developed the popular <a href="https://experience-ai.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI</a> resources in collaboration with Google DeepMind. In these resources, the contexts were carefully selected to represent real-world examples across disciplines, and to to enable the teaching of particular technical or social and ethical concepts. This could be described as &#8220;a push&#8221; of content from computing towards other disciplines. For example, to enable teaching about the ethical issues around plagiarism, an art context is used in the Experience AI resources; to enable teaching about the potential benefits of using AI tools, an ecological geography context is used.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>AI applications are always situated within a particular topic. Most current AI applications are data-driven: vast amounts of data are collected and processed to produce models that can then either be used to generate outputs or make predictions. For example, data about artworks can be collected and used to train a model for generating outputs similar to the artworks; this is an application of AI in the art discipline. Or data on wild fires can be collected and used to train a model for making predictions about current or prospective fires; this is an application of AI in the geography discipline.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

</div>


<p>In reality, the best people to recognise how AI technology is being applied in a discipline and what students in that discipline should be taught about these applications are the people working in the discipline, for example the art and geography teachers. Computer science educators can work to build the technical understanding and the general social and ethical understanding that is common across applications. But the detail of how AI technology is changing a discipline can only truly be understood by the respective community, by the artists and art educators, by the geographers and the geography educators.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">An emerging focus</h2>



<p>At present, though, most educators are grappling with how they can use AI tools for productivity, such as creating lesson plans, or answering emails. Or they are looking at how they can use AI for general teaching and learning, for example for personalisation, say for students with additional needs. The idea that their underpinning discipline is changing is, perhaps, not yet on teachers&#8217; radar. But at universities, such as in undergraduate courses, and in the world of work, education and training are changing. Data science courses are now being offered across faculties, including science, geography, language, and art faculties. These changes will start to filter down to school-based education via curriculum change. While some resources and professional development materials addressing this shift are already becoming available, change is still fragile and patchy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Raising awareness, building community and a common language</h2>



<p>The aims of our Applied AI research seminar series in 2026 are to start to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Raise awareness of the forthcoming changes that applying AI will bring to disciplines</li>



<li>Build a cross-discipline community</li>



<li>Think about a common language that could be used across disciplines</li>
</ul>



<p>If we can start to agree on what common concepts could be taught in the arts, sciences and humanities, it gives us a better chance to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Understand how to use AI as it is applied in different disciplines</li>



<li>Help students to build useful mental models and develop the agency and critical thinking skills they need to evaluate these applications and decide when and how to use them and how far to trust them</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">We need your help</h2>



<p>To make our 2026 series a success, we need to spread the word about our seminars to groups of educators, researchers, industry and policy makers across the arts, sciences, and humanities.</p>
