<p>In this blog post, we will share more about the safety features of Experience CS, and the steps we’ve taken to make the platform a great fit for your school.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A safe, teacher-managed environment</h2>



<p>Experience CS supports young people to develop their understanding of computer science through engaging, interactive projects using the programming language Scratch. Scratch is a popular block-based language that helps young people get started with coding, and Experience CS includes a version of Scratch that we have built especially for schools. With our version, which is fully integrated into the Experience CS platform, students can explore coding in a teacher-managed, closed environment that aligns with schools’ safeguarding policies and gives you full control over what your students see and do.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="609" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/scratch_experience_cs.jpg" alt="Scratch coding within Experience CS. If you've used our Code Editor, you'll recognise this interface." class="wp-image-90202" style="width:824px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/scratch_experience_cs.jpg 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/scratch_experience_cs-300x114.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/scratch_experience_cs-500x190.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/scratch_experience_cs-768x292.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/scratch_experience_cs-1536x585.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/scratch_experience_cs-800x305.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/scratch_experience_cs-450x171.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/scratch_experience_cs-900x343.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Scratch coding within Experience CS. If you&#8217;ve used our Code Editor, you&#8217;ll recognise this interface.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Student safety and privacy are at the forefront in Experience CS, which means:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A private, closed environment</strong>. Projects are kept within the classroom and cannot be published to a public gallery.<br></li>



<li><strong>Teacher-controlled access</strong>. Students don’t need to create or manage their own accounts. Teachers manage their students’ access, with no student email addresses required.<br></li>



<li><strong>No social features</strong>. Students don’t create public profiles or follow other users, and there are no chat or comment features for young people.<br></li>



<li><strong>Curated content</strong>. Students can only access the projects and materials you share with them, not content from other users.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tailor-made for schools</h2>



<p>We have designed every part of the Experience CS platform with school environments in mind, making it easier for teachers to manage and for students to use.</p>



<p>Here’s how:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fully integrated platform.</strong> Everything students need is built into the Experience CS platform, including Scratch, lesson resources, student materials, and project templates. There is no need to visit other websites.<br></li>



<li><strong>Simple access. </strong>Teachers generate class codes so learners can jump straight into activities, with no student email address required.<br></li>



<li><strong>Automatic progress saving.</strong> Students’ projects are saved in the platform and linked to their class. Teachers can see students’ progress at a glance.<br></li>



<li><strong>Teacher control.</strong> Teachers have full visibility of students’ activity, and what students see and do stays within the classroom environment.</li>
</ul>



<p>Experience CS gives you the tools and peace of mind to deliver creative, engaging computer science lessons and activities in a way that works for your school. You will be able to effortlessly manage students’ work, with everything you and your students need provided within a simple, intuitive interface.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Scratch is the ideal starting point</strong></h2>



<p>Every coding journey begins with a single step. Scratch delivers this first step in a way that is playful, approachable, and empowering. Scratch immediately delivers tangible results that new coders can feel proud of by linking coding to storytelling, design, and play. It also cultivates curiosity, confidence, and resilience — qualities crucial to long-term success in both coding and problem solving.</p>



<p>Most importantly, Scratch emphasises exploration over perfection. It invites young learners to experiment freely, troubleshoot confidently, and express themselves creatively without fear of making mistakes. This exploratory mindset provides the foundation for future technical proficiency and innovation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Get started with our free projects</strong></h2>



<p>Starting with structured projects helps young learners build solid coding skills while maintaining enthusiasm and enjoyment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/catch-the-bus"><strong>Catch the bus (animation)</strong></a></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="688" height="361" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-9.png" alt="" class="wp-image-90175" style="width:662px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-9.png 688w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-9-300x157.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-9-500x262.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-9-450x236.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /></figure></div>


<p>In ‘Catch the bus’, coders create an animation featuring a character (called a sprite in Scratch) attempting to catch a departing bus. They learn how to sequence events, switch costumes to simulate movement, and synchronise actions to tell a simple story. This introduces fundamental storytelling and animation skills in Scratch.</p>



<p><strong>What you&#8217;ll learn:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Timing and sequencing actions</li>



<li>Using costume changes to simulate movement</li>



<li>Creating narrative animations</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/chomp-the-cheese"><strong>Chomp the cheese (interactive)</strong></a></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1344" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-scaled.png" alt="" class="wp-image-90176" style="width:664px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-scaled.png 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-300x157.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-500x262.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-768x403.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-1536x806.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-2048x1075.png 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-800x420.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-450x236.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-900x472.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure></div>


<p>In ‘Chomp the cheese’, learners use facial recognition tools in Scratch Lab to build an interactive game controlled by mouth movements. Using a webcam, players physically open their mouths to &#8220;chomp&#8221; virtual cheese snacks on screen. This playful and engaging activity introduces machine learning concepts in a tangible and enjoyable way.</p>



<p><strong>What you&#8217;ll learn:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Using facial recognition in Scratch</li>



<li>Creating interactive games with webcam input</li>



<li>Basic concepts of machine learning and interactivity</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/boat-race"><strong>Boat race (game)</strong></a></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="688" height="361" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-90177" style="width:664px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-11.png 688w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-11-300x157.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-11-500x262.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-11-450x236.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /></figure></div>


<p>In ‘Boat race’, young coders create a game where players navigate a boat around obstacles, steering using mouse controls. They learn to handle player input, detect collisions, and define conditions for winning. This foundational game-making experience sets the stage for more complex creations in the future.</p>



<p><strong>What you&#8217;ll learn:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Controlling sprites with mouse clicks</li>



<li>Collision detection between sprites</li>



<li>Defining goals and win conditions</li>
</ul>



<p>&#8220;The key to sparking a lifelong interest in coding is excitement. When young people are building something they genuinely care about, they&#8217;re not worried about getting everything perfect on the first try. They&#8217;re chasing their ideas and learning as they go. Scratch creates the ideal environment for this type of messy, brilliant exploration. It provides young coders with the freedom to experiment, persevere, and express themselves — all while enjoying the process,&#8221; or so says my amazing colleague Pete Bell, Learning Manager and creator of some of our most engaging content at the Raspberry Pi Foundation. I have to say, I agree with him!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Level up and build momentum</strong></h2>



<p>After completing their first projects, young coders can continue to build momentum through several exciting avenues:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ready-to-remix-favourite-projects-to-tinker-with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Personalise projects</a>:</strong> Encourage learners to remix existing projects by altering characters, backgrounds, and rules. Personalisation deepens learning and fosters ownership of the coding experience.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/python" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Explore Python</a>:</strong> Scratch&#8217;s block-based coding naturally leads to curiosity about text-based languages like Python, which many learners find an exciting next step.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://codeclub.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Join a Code Club</a>:</strong> Coding alongside peers transforms individual learning into a social experience. Code Clubs offer a collaborative environment where learners solve problems together, share creations, and build lasting friendships.</li>
</ul>



<p>Encouraging personalisation, curiosity, and community involvement keeps learners motivated and engaged on their coding journey.</p>

<p>This is something I’ve heard a lot when delivering <a href="https://parentzone.org.uk/ExperienceAI">Experience AI teacher training</a> through Parent Zone’s partnership with the Raspberry Pi Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Our partnership with the Raspberry Pi Foundation</strong></h2>



<p>Experience AI is an artificial intelligence (AI) literacy programme, co-developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Google DeepMind, that teaches students aged 11 to 14 about AI and machine learning. Thanks to funding from <a href="http://google.org">Google.org</a>, Parent Zone has partnered with the Raspberry Pi Foundation to provide free training to UK educators, equipping them with the skills they need to effectively deliver the programme in their settings.<br><br>The Experience AI <a href="http://rpf.io/expai-blog-parentzone1">resources </a>help educators, including those from non-technical backgrounds, to deliver impactful lessons on AI and machine learning. Lesson resources span technical elements (e.g. data-driven models, bias) and practical elements (e.g. careers, safety).</p>



<p>Our face-to-face and virtual training sessions show teachers how to use the programme resources, as well as helping them feel more confident in the subject matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sessions also give me an opportunity to hear from teachers about how AI is being used and taught in classrooms,&nbsp;and the opportunities and challenges it’s creating.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="584" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai.jpg" alt="A group of educators at a workshop." class="wp-image-90148" style="width:802px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-500x292.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-768x449.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-800x467.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-450x263.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-900x526.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Curiosity and experimentation</strong></h2>



<p>AI has a major presence in many schools now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teachers tell me they’re seeing students use AI to support their homework. One teacher spoke about a student using a chatbot to help break down a maths problem, describing it like “having a tutor at home.”</p>



<p>Teachers are also using AI themselves to assist in their work — for example, to plan lessons, generate activities, and get ideas on how to explain complex topics more clearly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Openness to experimentation is clearly there.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1.jpg" alt="Educators at a workshop." class="wp-image-90150" style="width:800px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Addressing concerns</strong></h2>



<p>For all the benefits of AI, teachers also have concerns about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some have told me their students have no idea how easily these tools can be used to mislead or manipulate, through disinformation and deepfakes, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why Experience AI resources are meeting educator needs. Not only do they explain how AI and machine learning actually work, but they also address many pressing concerns around AI, from responsible usage and media literacy, to how data bias can affect the final output.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Positive changes</strong></h2>



<p>In all the workshops, what stands out to me most is how ready teachers are to engage. They want to understand more. They want to help their students make sense of AI, and use it positively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’re grateful for practical, grounded training and support that doesn’t assume they’ve all got computer science degrees. After one of our sessions, a teacher said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“The better we educate ourselves, the better we&#8217;re able to help young people. It’s important because it&#8217;s affecting their day-to-day lives. We can help them navigate AI platforms, but in a safe way.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>’Digital literacy’ is a term that seems to pop up everywhere. In the early 2000s, it was the next big thing; some even suggested it might replace traditional literacy and numeracy. But, like many educational trends, it soon faded from the spotlight, and became something that schools &#8216;should&#8217; do, or something left to the lone teacher who had been handed the role of IT coordinator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For many teachers, at least in the UK, digital literacy meant booking a set of laptops (and hoping the last class had remembered to charge them) and ticking off history learning objectives by making a PowerPoint about Henry VIII’s wives. It became a bit of an afterthought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More recently, digital literacy seems to have been rebranded as ‘digital skills’, often framed as the capabilities young people need for the workplace of tomorrow. But I don’t think that tells the full story.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Digital literacy beyond employability</h2>



<p>Digital literacy isn’t just about employability; it’s about fairness and access. It’s about more than just learning to use spreadsheets (though my love for Excel remains strong); it’s about ensuring that all young people have the knowledge and confidence to navigate the digital world we live in today.</p>



<p>Digital literacy is about understanding the digital tools we rely on every day, securely accessing online services, making informed decisions about sharing personal information, and critically evaluating the endless stream of news and misinformation online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/teach/ai-education">about artificial intelligence</a>: not just playing with the latest tools, but <a href="http://rpf.io/expai-hw-blogra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">understanding how they work</a>, the biases built into them, and the ways they shape our lives.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-scaled.jpg" alt="Three ways to help students learn about the impact of technology" class="wp-image-90006" style="width:652px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure></div>


<p>True digital literacy empowers young people to engage with technology thoughtfully, critically, and confidently. And that’s something worth making space for. To truly ensure that young people have fair access to the digitally enabled world we live in, we must equip them with the skills to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/should-we-ditch-the-term-digital-native-the-latest-conversation-on-the-podcast/">understand and use technology effectively</a>. This means making space for digital literacy <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/">within the curriculum</a> and ensuring that all teachers feel confident in delivering it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Digital literacy as a core part of teaching</h2>



<p>Every teacher has a role to play in helping students develop these essential skills. This requires high-quality curriculum resources that integrate digital tools meaningfully into different subjects, as well as <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/courses/learn-python">comprehensive teacher training</a> to ensure every educator feels empowered to teach digital literacy as part of their everyday practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let’s not treat digital literacy like that forgotten box of tangled charging cables in the staffroom (important, but nobody is quite sure what to do with it). Instead, let’s make it a core part of teaching, just like reading, writing, and knowing how to keep a straight face when a student asks if they really need to save their work.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1379" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0002-scaled.jpg" alt="Two girls code at a desktop computer while a female mentor observes them." class="wp-image-63420" style="width:654px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0002-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0002-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0002-768x414.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0002-500x269.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0002-1536x827.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0002-2048x1103.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0002-800x431.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0002-scaled-450x242.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2020/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0002-scaled-900x485.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure></div>


<p>If we get this right, we’re not just preparing young people for the jobs of tomorrow, we’re making sure they can navigate today’s digital world safely, confidently, and with the critical thinking skills to tell fact from fiction (because let’s face it, the internet isn’t exactly short on absolute nonsense).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, who’s up for making a PowerPoint about Henry VIII’s wives?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coolest Projects is all about empowering young people to show off what they&#8217;ve built, no matter their skill level or experience. From first-time coders to budding engineers, everyone was welcomed and learnt something from the day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Celebrating impact: Broadcom Foundation Coding with Commitment®&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>One of the standout moments was the presentation of the Broadcom Foundation Coding with Commitment® special recognition, which highlights a project that uses code to solve real-world problems.</p>



<p>The award went to Kaila for her project, Car vs Road, a self-driving car simulation designed to explore how natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes might impact autonomous vehicle technology.</p>

<p><em>Today’s blog post is written by Paul Akwabi, Executive Director at <a href="https://techkidzafrica.co.ke/">Tech Kidz Africa</a>, part of our global partner network for <a href="http://rpf.io/tka-blogpost" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI</a>.</em></p>



<p>As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to reshape industries and redefine how we work and learn, it is essential that Kenyan educators are equipped with the knowledge and skills to introduce AI concepts to their learners.</p>



<p>In Kenya, the education system has taken significant steps towards digital literacy through the Competency Based Curriculum (CBC), which has introduced young learners to coding using Scratch and laid a foundation for tech skills. However, AI is yet to be formally integrated into the curriculum. This has presented an opportunity to prepare teachers to integrate AI into their lessons and inspire the next generation of innovators.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Experience AI has increased digital literacy</h2>



<p>Our partnership with the Raspberry Pi Foundation has been a vital element in the retooling of Kenyan educators. Using the Foundation’s <a href="http://rpf.io/tka-blogpost">Experience AI resources</a>, which they co-developed with Google DeepMind, we have equipped 441 teachers with practical AI and machine learning skills through hands-on training sessions in five counties: Mombasa, Nairobi, Taita Taveta, Meru, and Nakuru.</p>



<p>Our work to empower young learners with coding, robotics, and AI skills has positioned us as a key driver of digital literacy in Kenya. The Experience AI materials have helped us take key next steps — we’ve scaled up AI education, reached more teachers, and further democratised access to emerging technologies, supporting our goal of ensuring that no child is left behind in the digital revolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make the delivery of our training sessions as smooth as possible, we’ve joined hands with county governments and local education authorities like the Teachers Service Commission (TSC). In all the counties we’ve been working in, the TSC are actively promoting digital literacy among teachers and have made sure we equip teachers with the understanding and skills to use AI effectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through our expert trainers, we’ve been able to offer hands-on introductions to AI concepts, provide opportunities for practical problem-solving with machine learning models, and expose participants to real-world AI applications. A great example of the work we’ve done is the training we gave to teachers in Meru County, where they learned to create an AI model that recognises certain food types in supermarkets. Later, in group sessions, participants developed their own diverse and innovative AI models. One group, for instance, designed an AI model for dishwashing that detects dirty dishes and automates the water removal process.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Feedback from training</h2>



<p>Through the Experience AI training sessions, many educators gained new confidence and skills, and have already started to integrate AI into their classrooms.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;I am grateful for the invaluable skills gained through the Experience AI training. The knowledge I’ve acquired will not only enhance my ability to conduct research but also empower me to teach my students how to effectively use AI. This is just the beginning. I look forward to building on this foundation and exploring even greater possibilities with AI.&#8221; — <strong>Mr. Githinji, Meru, Kenya</strong></p>

<p>In any aspect of life, learning is about shifting perspectives, nurturing curiosity, and embracing new possibilities — this is what drives innovation. The Experience AI training in Kenya has exemplified this, transforming how we think and approach technology.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I am glad that my county has been considered in this training. I challenge the teachers here to make use of these useful resources to spice up learning in the classroom. I was once a mathematics teacher and I wish I had technology to teach. Thank you Tech Kidz Africa, Raspberry Pi Foundation and Google DeepMind for empowering these teachers.” <strong>— His Excellency Andrew Mwadime, Governor Taita Taveta County</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The overwhelming enthusiasm from educators and learners is evidence that the Experience AI lessons have been highly impactful. Teachers have expressed a strong desire for more training opportunities to support them in equipping students for the future. Many of the teachers have also expressed how the training has demystified AI, enhancing accessibility and giving their daily teaching added relevance. In addition, there is a clear call to scale up these efforts to reach more teachers across the counties in Kenya to ensure that AI education is widespread and inclusive.</p>

<p>The term ‘digital native’ was coined in 2001 to describe young people who grew up surrounded by technology, implying they possess an almost instinctive understanding of digital tools. But how accurate is that label today? Are they truly tech-savvy, or are they simply fluent in using user-friendly devices without a deeper understanding of how they work?&nbsp;</p>

<p>In our <a href="http://rpf.io/hwp-digitalnative-podcastlinkblog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest podcast episode</a>, we explore this crucial question: does growing up with technology automatically make someone digitally literate, or just digitally dependent?</p>



<p>Host James Robinson (Raspberry Pi Foundation) is joined by colleague Sway Grantham, Anna Lahtinen (Haaga-Helia University), and Nicole O’Connor (Digi Know This) to unpack the complexities of digital skills, access, and education, and to explore how the label of digital native can sometimes hide broader challenges.</p>



<p>This episode wraps up our three-part mini-series on digital literacy. Each episode builds on the conversations from the latest issue of <em>Hello World</em> magazine, offering expert insight and practical ideas from educators driving real change.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who are the guests on the podcast, and what will I learn?</h2>



<p>We’ve assembled a panel of expert guests to discuss and debate the concept of the digital native.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="500" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-6-500x500.png" alt="Square headshot of Anna Lahtinen who featured on the Hello World podcast." class="wp-image-89994" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-6-500x500.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-6-250x250.png 250w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-6-150x150.png 150w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-6-768x768.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-6-800x800.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-6-100x100.png 100w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-6-300x300.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-6-450x450.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-6-900x900.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-6.png 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Anna Lahtinen, Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences</strong></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Anna is an internationally recognised scholar who specialises in the transformative effects of artificial intelligence (AI) on working life, businesses, and careers. <strong>In the latest issue of <em><a href="http://rpf.io/blog-hwp-digital-native" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello World</a></em>, Anna and her colleague Antonia O’Connell write about assumptions regarding high digital literacy among youth in the setting of a work environment.</strong></p>



<p><a href="http://rpf.io/hwp-digitalnative-podcastlinkblog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the podcast</a>, Anna explains that the term <em>‘digital native&#8217;</em> can be useful for starting conversations about the skills, access, and confidence people need to navigate technology, particularly in the workplace. However, she warns that the term can be misleading, as it often assumes that young people have strong digital skills, when many struggle with the practical demands of using technology at work.</p>



<p>Anna also highlights the importance of supporting young people to use technology responsibly and develop a healthy relationship with it. As she puts it: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“If we instil the right values in students, that will eventually lead to a healthy relationship with technology and ethical use of new tools in both their work and their lives.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nicole O’Connor is a two-time female founder who brings her expertise to improving teaching and learning through innovative EdTech, digital literacy, and accessibility.</p>



<p><a href="http://rpf.io/hwp-digitalnative-podcastlinkblog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the podcast</a>, Nicole challenges the idea of the<em> </em>digital native<em>,</em> calling it both problematic and overly simplistic. She explains that the term overlooks important differences, like access, privilege, and levels of exposure to technology, which all shape a person’s digital skills. For Nicole, it’s a <em>“grey area”</em> that proves we can’t assume young people are automatically tech-savvy just because they grew up with devices.</p>



<p>Nicole sees digital literacy as a journey, not something people are born with. She compares it to learning a language: while young people may be familiar with technology, they still need to develop deeper skills to become critical thinkers, careful users, and aware of issues like data privacy and online safety. As she puts it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“They might have had some exposure, but over time they need to learn the skills to be digitally literate… They’re not even close to that.”</em></p>

<p>This week, young people participating in the European Astro Pi Challenge 2024/25 will have their programs run in space! Astronauts from the European Space Agency (ESA) have been setting up the Astro Pi computers on board the International Space Station (ISS) ready to receive the programs. </p>



<p>The European Astro Pi Challenge is an ESA Education project run in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It has two strands: Mission Zero, where young people write programs that display pixel art on LED screens on board the ISS, and Mission Space Lab, where more advanced learners attempt to calculate the speed of the ISS by writing programs that gather data from onboard equipment.</p>



<p>This year has already been a great year for the challenge!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mission Zero reaches more young people than ever</h2>



<p>Mission Zero received 17,285 team submissions this year, representing 25,405 young people from ESA member and associate member states. This marks the highest-ever level of participation in Mission Zero since its inception back in 2017. Here at Mission Control, we’re delighted to announce that nearly all the participating teams (17,109 out of 17,285) have achieved ‘flight status’ — meaning that their programs will run in space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been great to see so many young people taking part from areas of educational disadvantage too. Through partnerships with youth organisations and community events such as Beyond the Bias and Norwich Science Festival, we’ve seen Mission Zero reach even more young creators from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>



<p>The 2024/25 Mission Zero project guide featured new coded pixel art examples for teams to remix and reinterpret. Many teams also created their own artworks and animations, with amazing creativity and coding skills on display. We’ll be selecting six submissions from this year to feature as the new code examples in the 2025/26 Mission Zero project guide. Look out for more news on this in the summer.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New highs for Mission Space Lab</h2>



<p>Mission Space Lab teams were tasked again this year with writing programs to collect data from cameras and sensors on board the ISS to calculate its speed. We’ve been really pleased to see 562 teams register and 325 submit their programs. This has resulted in an amazing 309 teams being awarded flight status — their programs will each run on the ISS for ten minutes, giving participants the unparalleled opportunity to record sensor data in space and take photos many miles above the Earth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More teams have submitted programs and achieved flight status this year than in 2023/24. We believe this uptick is due, in part, to a couple of new additions that have made submissions easier:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Firstly, Mission Space Lab teams can now test their programs online using the <a href="https://missions.astro-pi.org/msl/replay-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Pi Replay Tool</a>. This gives them a chance to see if their program will work on the real Astro Pis on board the ISS by replaying historical data sets captured from previous missions. </li>
</ul>



<p>Secondly, teams have been able to use the Picamzero Python library, which makes it easier to use PiCamera2 functionality.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Deployment</h2>



<p>Today’s the day when Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab teams with flight status will have their programs sent up to the ISS. Astronauts have been busy setting up the Astro Pi computers ready to receive the programs and putting them into position. Over the next two weeks, the programs will run and the collected data will be sent down from the ISS to Earth.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="1200" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5.png" alt="An illustration of the International Space Station sending program files to a satellite dish on Earth" class="wp-image-89950" style="width:746px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5.png 1200w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-250x250.png 250w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-500x500.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-150x150.png 150w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-768x768.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-800x800.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-100x100.png 100w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-300x300.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-450x450.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-900x900.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Files being sent down from the ISS</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In June, Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab teams will receive certificates of participation with the exact times their programs ran on the ISS, along with the coordinates of where the ISS was above the Earth. Mission Space Lab teams will also receive a zip file with the data their programs collected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>None of this would have been possible without the hard work of all the mentors, teachers, and Code Club leaders that organise the teams of young people doing the Astro Pi missions. </p>



<p>Let’s stay curious, with our eyes upwards on that final frontier!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking for ways to keep your creators coding?</h2>

<p>In the <a href="http://rpf.io/hwp-empowering-podcastlinkblog">latest episode of the Hello World podcast</a>, Rachel Arthur, Chief Learning Officer at the Raspberry Pi Foundation, is joined by Dr. Jessica Hamer from King’s College London and Becky Patel from Tech She Can. Together, they explore the current state of girls’ engagement in computing and what we can do to support change.</p>



<p>This episode is the second in our three-part mini series on digital literacy. Each episode continues the conversations featured in the latest issue of the Hello World magazine, offering expert perspectives and practical examples from educators making a difference.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the gender gap, and why is it a problem?</strong></h2>



<p>The gender gap in computing refers to the disparity between the proportion of female and male students who choose computing as a subject or career. This is problematic because:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It reinforces harmful societal stereotypes that limit opportunities for girls</li>



<li>It hinders economic growth and innovation</li>



<li>It limits diversity in tech development, potentially leading to biased products, especially in artificial intelligence (AI)</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who are the guests on the podcast, and what will I learn?</strong></h2>



<p>To address these issues in detail, Rachel is joined by two guests who have dedicated years to understanding and addressing the gender gap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Jessica Hamer is a Research Associate at King&#8217;s College London. She transitioned to academic research after working for a decade as a science teacher in secondary education. With a focus on projects like the <a href="https://scari.sites.er.kcl.ac.uk/">SCARI project</a>, she investigates factors affecting girls&#8217; performance and participation in secondary-level computing. Her work includes a key report published last year on this topic.</p>



<p>In the <a href="http://rpf.io/hwp-empowering-podcastlinkblog">podcast</a>, Dr. Hamer reveals concerning findings about stereotypes in computing and how early they form. She explains that beliefs portraying girls as less interested in computing emerge as early as ages five or six, which significantly hinders girls’ engagement and involvement in the field.</p>



<p>Further, when students were asked to name famous figures in computing, most cited white, male tech entrepreneurs who are frequently in the news. This revealed a limited view of the kinds of people involved in computing, as well as a narrow conception of tech careers, with roles in areas like climate change and social justice being overlooked. However, Jessica highlights a key insight: <em>“We found that girls were three times more likely to suggest a female famous face”,</em> emphasising the vital importance of female representation and the need for relatable role models.</p>

<p>Becky Patel is the Head of Education and Learning at <a href="https://techshecan.org/tech-we-can">Tech She Can</a>, a UK charity focused on increasing women&#8217;s representation in technology. She has a decade of teaching experience in both primary and secondary education and now develops the ‘Tech WE Can’ educational resources, which aim to inspire all children, particularly girls, to pursue careers in technology.</p>



<p>In the <a href="http://rpf.io/hwp-empowering-podcastlinkblog">podcast</a>, Becky emphasises the importance of early intervention to address gender stereotypes. She advocates for introducing children to a wide range of STEM careers, and to do this not just in computing lessons but across the whole curriculum. <br><br>Another key strategy Becky highlights is showing children that they can explore their hobbies and interests further through technology, even when at first glance it might seem that technology can’t play a role. She explains:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“There are so many tech roles which you can do working behind the scenes, training the athlete, helping them with health and physiotherapy, working on goal-line technology… There&#8217;s so many cool things and when you show children this, you see the attention. You see them sit up like, hold on, she&#8217;s talking about me and the thing I love. And she&#8217;s also talking about computing.”&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More to discover next week</strong></h2>



<p>Next week, in the final podcast in our mini series, we’ll be looking at the notion of the ‘digital native’. Are young people truly tech-savvy, or are they simply reliant on digital tools without understanding the underlying mechanics?</p>
