<p>We love hearing from members of the community and sharing the stories of amazing young people, volunteers, and educators who are using their passion for technology to create positive change in the world around them.</p>



<p>In our latest story, we’re meeting a group of inspiring young innovators from Belfast — Michelle, 15, Inilouwa, 18, Jedidiah, 14 — and Irioluwa, 11, who are using their creativity and technical skills to tackle an issue that impacts millions of young women across the UK: period poverty.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The power of community</strong></h2>



<p>The group first connected through Diverse Youth, a community space that gave them the chance to collaborate, learn, and grow.</p>



<p>At the youth centre, the girls were introduced to Code Club through mentor, and Jedidiah’s mum, Tiwa. When Tiwa offered them the opportunity to travel to Coolest Projects UK and showcase projects they had been working on, they knew they wanted to make something special…</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1920" height="840" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2024-10-28-115717.png" alt="Flow Body website screenshot" class="wp-image-92006" style="width:776px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2024-10-28-115717.png 1920w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2024-10-28-115717-300x131.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2024-10-28-115717-500x219.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2024-10-28-115717-768x336.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tackling taboo topics</strong></h2>



<p>The idea for Flow Body began when Inilouwa was inspired by her sister’s experience at school.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“So, for me, it was my sister actually, that really inspired this project because she would tell me, her school at the time, they run out of period products very frequently, so not a lot of girls could access it.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wanting to make a difference, the team created Flow Body, a website connecting young women to period charities in the UK and providing reliable information about periods, puberty, and related health issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Playing to their strengths</strong></h2>



<p>The technical side of the project was led by Inilouwa, with the rest of her teammates supporting her with research and content creation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“So, alongside Michelle, I researched the diseases and what can come from period poverty and how different people get by with the lack of period products around,” Jedidiah said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Their research highlighted just how widespread period-related health issues are.</p>



<p>The team discovered that one of the biggest challenges is access to accurate information, given the stigma around discussing menstruation, and using technology to solve this issue seemed like the perfect fit to them.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Inilouwa explained, “Having that access to information that&#8217;s tailored to young women, to young parents, to everyone all across the board would be really helpful, you know, in order to make periods less of a strange topic to discuss.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Celebrating teamwork</strong></h2>



<p>After taking home judges’ favourite in the web category, the girls could not recommend the experience enough. When asked what advice they would give to other young people thinking of taking the leap and entering Coolest Projects, the answer was simple…</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Do it. Don&#8217;t be afraid. Even if tech is not your thing, it&#8217;s not a lot of people&#8217;s things. But like you learn so much, you grow so much and it&#8217;s very fun. It is. It really is,” said Inilouwa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Listening to the voices of young people is crucial in creating genuinely effective learning resources. That&#8217;s why we recently ran a survey of students who use Ada Computer Science, our platform designed to help students learn and revise key computer science concepts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The different topics are nicely categorised and it is easy to find the information I wish to revise.” – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We were delighted to hear from 103 students, most of whom are 16–19 years old and studying in England, and their insights are invaluable in helping us to continue to develop Ada CS.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Students think Ada CS is high quality and useful</h2>



<p>The most common ways students use Ada CS are for revision and to check whether they understand concepts. The majority of respondents are building Ada CS into their regular study habits, with over half of respondents using the platform every week.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-500x281.png" alt="Photo of a class of students at computers, in a computer science classroom." class="wp-image-91975" style="width:682px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-900x506.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event.png 1300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>We were pleased to see the benefits of updates we’ve made, including a redesign of the question finder released in March 2025 — students reported that it is easy to navigate the platform and find what they need: 81% reported being able to find relevant content, and 77% could find the questions they were looking for.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It&#8217;s SO EASY to find exactly what I want.” – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Overall, students perceive Ada CS as both <strong>useful</strong> for learning about computer science concepts and of <strong>high quality</strong>. They reported finding the content clear, with a good level of detail.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The topics are broken down into easily digestible sections, and the provided diagrams really help with understanding the topics.”&nbsp; – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The resource is really well designed, short and concise.”&nbsp; – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also received helpful suggestions for future improvements. Students shared feedback on how the information on the platform is presented, asking for more concise, revision-friendly content as well as guidance for exploring concepts in more depth. We’ll therefore be looking into alternative ways to structure content as we continue to develop Ada CS.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="495" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-800x495.png" alt="Graph depicting how strongly students felt that Ada Computer Science helps them to learn about computer science concepts." class="wp-image-91968" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-800x495.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-300x186.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-500x309.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-768x475.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-1536x950.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-450x278.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-900x557.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2.png 1904w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Students rate the quizzes highly</h2>



<p>The most popular feature is the <strong>quizzes and practice questions</strong>,<strong> </strong>including the immediate feedback and hints provided. Students value how these resources help them solidify their knowledge, learn from mistakes, and prepare for assessments.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The questions are clear and make me think, they&#8217;re relevant to my studies and the hints for the questions are very useful.” – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also appreciated the suggestions we received for how we can further develop this feature, for example, creating more questions, extending the range of question types per topic, and making improvements to the hints.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Impact on learning</h2>



<p>Students also feel that using Ada CS has a tangible impact on their learning. 82% agreed they were more confident that they understand CS concepts as a result of using Ada CS<strong> </strong>and 79% feel more confident learning about computer science concepts without a teacher to explain.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I do CS A level but I hadn&#8217;t done the GCSE and I found that all of the resources gave me enough information to learn the concepts from scratch and now I&#8217;m much more confident in my knowledge of the theory.” – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="648" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-800x648.png" alt="Graph depicting how students feel using Ada CS has on their learning." class="wp-image-91969" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-800x648.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-300x243.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-500x405.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-768x622.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-1536x1244.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-450x364.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-900x729.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1.png 1862w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s coming next?</h2>



<p>Students provided us with lots of useful feedback and suggestions for how we can further improve Ada CS, especially relating to practice questions. We’re already working on adding more questions across topics, creating more challenging questions, and adding more question types that will enhance students’ learning experience. We’ve got some other exciting developments in the pipeline too, which we’ll announce soon!</p>



<p>Thank you to everyone who took the time to complete the survey. These findings are invaluable for shaping the future of Ada Computer Science, helping us to continue to provide the best possible learning platform for students.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exploring new technologies and inclusive teaching</strong></h2>



<p>Saturday began with hands-on sessions that brought creativity and technology together, exploring large language models and prompt engineering in <em>Collaborating with LLMs and being a prompt boss</em>. There was a lot of laughter from attendees about how large language models can produce confident but incorrect answers if given vague prompts, but many left inspired to experiment with new technologies in their own clubs.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“First time there and it was amazing. Met loads of great people and the amazing code club crew. I learnt loads of new skills around AI and Arduino.” – An attendee</p>

<p><em>Collaboration that counts </em>brought mentors together to discuss common challenges like volunteer retention, limited resources, and communication barriers. A crowd favourite was a shared volunteer toolkit, as well as event checklists and safeguarding resources.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“What I enjoyed most about the Clubs Conference was the opportunity to meet other facilitators and hear their stories — their successes and challenges. These conversations validated the volunteer work I do and reminded me of the impact of our clubs.” – An attendee</p>

<p>From the theatre sessions, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/zYqSiUoO2Ao?t=14640s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inclusive learning – Supporting Deaf learners in clubs</a> which was both moving and insightful. We learnt that visual demonstrations, colour cues, and repetition were key to supporting Deaf learners. One memorable quote captured the spirit of the session:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The children couldn&#8217;t speak to us. The children — we couldn&#8217;t hear their voices but by the eighth week we were able to hear their voices from what they built on the screen and it was echoing all around the classroom.” – Chidi Duru</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learning and making across continents</strong></h2>



<p>The weekend’s talks showcased the reach of Code Club worldwide, with volunteers sharing their experiences of collaboration, sustainability, and creativity.</p>



<p>Watch<em> </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/zYqSiUoO2Ao?t=3597s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lessons from resourceful Code Clubs in India</em></a>, which highlighted the ingenuity of young learners in under-resourced settings, while <em>Hands-on with the Raspberry Pi Pico </em>showcased low-cost, high-impact projects from Kenya and South Africa.</p>



<p>Speakers showed how community clubs adapt to local needs with unplugged activities and coding games inspired by cricket and kabaddi, empowering young people to solve real problems and celebrate curiosity through play. Excitingly, these new resources will be launching early next year; <a href="https://codeclub.org/en/resources/activities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep an eye on our activities page</a> to be among the first to try them out!</p>

<p>In the session <em>Code Club Projects Unplugged,</em> facilitators shared the idea of “hiding the vegetables” — hiding the learning inside the fun. Whether through a collaborative Scratch game, a micro:bit prop on stage, or a Pico gadget solving a real problem, this approach helps young people learn through play. They remember the joy, and the skills come naturally.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learning beyond the screen</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3dwzJim0AzI?t=1568s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Teaching tech away from the computer screen</em></a> shared a fun unplugged cybersecurity activity, <em>The Chicken Shop</em>, where learners role-play social engineering scenarios. Its success came from clear printed instructions, movement, humour, and strong debriefing.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3dwzJim0AzI?t=3178s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Learning coding outside the box</em></a> explored how to engage young people with diverse learning styles while the Arduino crash course gave attendees a taste of physical computing and C++ programming in action. Workshops on AI, sustainability, and youth empowerment with Raspberry Pi computers and <em>Unlocking Code Club resources</em> helped club leaders discover practical ways to inspire problem-solving and make use of all the support available through Code Club.</p>



<p>The message from the sessions was clear: young people learn best when technology is human and hands-on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Showcasing creativity with Coolest Projects</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3dwzJim0AzI?t=10265s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Coolest Projects – get involved!</em> </a>championed creativity over competition. Any young person under 18 can submit their project, including unfinished ideas. In-person and online showcases celebrate progress, imagination, and teamwork.</p>



<p>Speaking on the closing panel, Code Club leader Rachael Coultart talked about the importance of Coolest Projects as a rare platform for children to talk about their learning. She spoke about the experience of one particular child, explaining that it had made a powerful impression on her, saying:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It had such a huge impact. I felt so proud of her and what she’d achieved. Afterwards, her parents told me that they felt it was the first time she had really been seen.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the community is taking forward</strong></h2>



<p>The community is united in its commitment to making Code Clubs inclusive, creative, and sustainable.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Context matters — projects that reflect local interests and challenges motivate young people to learn</li>



<li>Accessibility is central: visual cues, repetition, interpreters, and inclusive resources support every learner</li>



<li>Structure builds confidence; start with simple, guided activities before open-ended exploration</li>



<li>Volunteers are vital; shared toolkits, checklists, and training help them deliver engaging sessions</li>



<li>Celebration and affordability matter too: regular showcases and tools like the micro:bit, Pico, and Crumble keep computing fun, hands-on, and accessible for all</li>
</ul>

<p>In this blog post, we are pleased to share <a href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/astro-pi/Astro_Pi_Impact_Report_2025.pdf">the Astro Pi 2024/25 impact report</a>, where we look at ways in which the Astro Pi Challenge is bringing value to the lives of many young people and mentors, based on survey responses and interviews. Along the way, we’ll debunk some myths about space science.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Astro Pi makes space science accessible</h2>



<p>Here at the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we’ve heard a few myths about space science and coding, and how daunting it can be to write a computer program, let alone one that can run in space. We can&#8217;t let these myths stand — instead we’re going to debunk them, equipped with evidence we’ve collected about the 2024/25 Astro Pi Challenge and previous challenge rounds.</p>

<p>Read on for some astronomical facts from our latest impact report, and get ready to help young people in your community send their code into space.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Myth 1: You have to be a rocket scientist to send things into space</h3>



<p>Not true! In the Astro Pi Challenge 2024/25, young people created over 17,800 computer programs that ran on board the International Space Station (ISS). Teams of young people aged between 8 and 19 took part in the challenge in a range of settings, including schools, Code Clubs, libraries, and community youth groups. They wrote short programs in Python, which were then sent to run on special Raspberry Pi computers, called Astro Pis, in the Columbus module of the ISS.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1417" height="797" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis.jpg" alt="The Astro Pi computers." class="wp-image-91911" style="width:726px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis.jpg 1417w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis-900x506.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1417px) 100vw, 1417px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Astro Pi computers up close.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Since the first Astro Pis arrived on the ISS in 2015, over 160,000 young people have had their code run in space. To celebrate their achievements, they each received certificates with the exact time and location of the ISS when their programs ran.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;We want our code to run in space! We are fascinated by discovery and the opportunity to contribute to a real science experiment on the ISS.&#8221; – Mission Space Lab mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Myth 2: Only experienced programmers can write code for the International Space Station</h3>



<p>Not true! The Astro Pi Challenge is made up of two missions, Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab, and Mission Zero is perfect for young people who are new to text-based coding. With the help of <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astro-pi-mission-zero">step-by-step project instructions</a>, young people write a short Python program to display personalised pixel art on board the ISS, using data from a sensor on one of the Astro Pi computers in their image.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2268" height="1276" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828.jpg" alt="Young people writing Mission Zero programs." class="wp-image-91912" style="width:722px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828.jpg 2268w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-900x506.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2268px) 100vw, 2268px" /></figure></div>


<p>In fact, Mission Zero mentors find that the low-stakes nature of the activity coupled with the real-world connection to space create an ideal learning environment. 83% of Mission Zero 2024/25 mentors told us that participation increased young people’s skills and confidence in computing and digital making, and 78% believed that young people were likely to participate in other computing or digital making challenges in the future.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“They [young people] come from complicated environments and sometimes their confidence is very low. They don’t believe in themselves and this [Mission Zero] really empowers them.” – Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Myth 3: Learning to write code for the ISS only involves technical skills</h3>



<p>Not true! Mission Zero engages young people in thinking creatively as they plan their artwork, and Mission Space Lab involves working in teams to write a computer program to solve a scientific task in space, combining teamwork, problem-solving, and knowledge from other scientific domains. While 100% of mentors whose teams successfully completed Mission Space Lab in 2024/25 agreed that participation improved young people’s skills in computing and digital making, 91% also confirmed that it increased young people’s confidence in these areas, and 91% told us that it increased young people’s understanding of STEM concepts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impact likely goes beyond building skills. Mentors from both Astro Pi 2024/25 missions told us that the challenge made young people feel connected to a wider community of learners around the world, and the excitement of the challenge also extended to the mentors themselves, as well as other adults in their community.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Mission Zero is a way of connecting not only to a worldwide group of learners, but also to explorers, future scientists, and future astronauts. To see them as part of a larger community and not just an activity or assignment that they have to do in class.” – Mission Zero mentor</p>

<p>One of the things I love most about my role as Chief Learning Officer at the Raspberry Pi Foundation is hearing from teachers around the world. A teacher in Kenya told me how their students debugged their first programming projects on a shared laptop. In Scotland, another explained how our resources gave them the confidence to teach computing for the very first time. These stories remind me daily why our work matters: <strong>every young person, no matter where they live, should have the chance to explore the power of computing.</strong></p>

<p>But creating resources that work in such different contexts is not easy. How do we design materials that work in a wide range of learning environments, from a bustling city classroom to a rural school where internet access can vary? How do we make sure that every learner sees themselves reflected in the examples we choose?</p>



<p>That’s where our <strong>teaching and learning design principles</strong> come in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What makes our approach different</strong></h2>



<p>Over the past decade, we’ve learned a huge amount about what teachers and learners need from us. We’ve made mistakes, we’ve listened, and we’ve refined our practice again and again. The result is a set of design principles that guide the creation of everything we make, from full curricula to one-off projects.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-800x533.jpg" alt="Four students at laptops in a school in India." class="wp-image-91402" style="width:711px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<p>These principles are practical and based on real classroom experience. They’re our way of making sure our resources are reliable, inspiring, and flexible, wherever and however teachers use them.</p>



<p>Here’s what that looks like in action:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>High quality</strong> – You can trust our resources to be accurate and classroom-ready. We put every piece of content through rigorous checks because we understand how busy you are.<br></li>



<li><strong>Research-informed</strong> – Our choices are grounded in evidence, not guesswork. We blend academic studies with insight from teachers like you and our own evaluations to create approaches that genuinely work.<br></li>



<li><strong>Consistent</strong> – We design our materials to fit together, so learners can build skills step by step, without confusion or contradiction along the way.<br></li>



<li><strong>Inclusive by design</strong> – We think carefully about accessibility, representation, and language right from the start. When young people see themselves reflected in computing, they see it as a future they can be a part of.<br></li>



<li><strong>Adaptable</strong> – No two classrooms are the same. By making our resources editable and flexible, we give you the freedom to shape them for your learners.</li>
</ul>

</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why share these design principles now?</strong></h2>



<p>For us, being transparent about our approach is about trust. Teachers make daily decisions about which resources to use, often with limited preparation time. By showing you the principles behind our work, we want to give you the confidence that our content is not only free and adaptable, but also designed with care, expertise, and your learners at the heart.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>



<p>The world of computing education is moving fast, from new programming software, to artificial intelligence tools. Our design principles give us a strong foundation to keep innovating while staying true to our mission of <strong>enabling young people to realise their full potential through the power of computing and digital technologies.</strong></p>

<p>Social media can have a powerful impact on the way we see and experience the world. What we see in our feeds is not random: it is determined by AI-driven systems that collect vast amounts of data, build user profiles, analyse engagement, and generate recommendations. But while <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/research-and-data/media-literacy-research/children/children-media-use-and-attitudes-2024/childrens-media-literacy-report-2024.pdf?v=368229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">young people are prolific users of social media</a>, studies show that many have little understanding of what is happening ‘under the hood’</p>

<p>In our September research seminar, we welcomed back <strong>Henriikka Vartiainen</strong> and <strong>Matti Tedre</strong> from the University of Eastern Finland. They introduced <em>Somekone</em>, a social media simulator that is designed to help learners understand some of the fundamental processes behind social media platforms. Their team has been developing AI education materials and tools since 2019, including <a href="https://tm.gen-ai.fi/image/general" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GenAI Teachable Machine</a>, which they presented at our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/opening-the-box-tools-to-teach-young-people-about-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May research seminar</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Collaboration and co-design</h2>



<p>Henriikka explained that the development of the <em>Somekone</em> tool emerged from the team’s long-term collaboration with teachers and schools in Finland. They co-developed the tool with the aim of making concepts like data collection, engagement, profiling, recommendations, filter bubbles, and polarisation visible and explainable for students aged 11 to 13 years old.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A four-phase learning model</h2>



<p>Henriikka described the <strong>pedagogical model</strong> that the team follows in all of their AI education interventions. Their goal is not only to support students to develop their understanding of AI concepts, but also to foster ethical awareness and a sense of agency.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Phase 1: Contextualisation and familiarisation</strong><strong><br></strong>Students begin by discussing their experiences with social media and their initial ideas about how platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram work. This activates students’ prior knowledge and helps connect the learning to their own interests. It also enables teachers to uncover any misconceptions the students may have.<br></li>



<li><strong>Phase 2: Exploration</strong><strong><br></strong>Students explore their initial ideas by experimenting with the <em>Somekone </em>tool. They discover how different types of data are collected and combined for profiling in a way that connects these new concepts to their own everyday lives.<br></li>



<li><strong>Phase 3: Design and inquiry<br></strong>Students explore the <em>Somekone</em> tool more deeply. Teachers guide them through activities where the students analyse, interpret, and discuss the data they can see in the tool. Importantly, the data they are using has all been gathered from their activity on the platform. Students can see how the likes, follows, and comments they and their classmates make change the images they are shown, and this is all real time.<br></li>



<li><strong>Phase 4: Ethical and societal reflection<br></strong>Students reflect on what they have learnt and consider the broader impacts of social media. Teachers encourage them to think critically, question the way social media platforms currently work, and imagine alternatives. At the end of the project, students write letters to decision-makers with their suggestions for how social media could better serve children’s interests.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Inside the simulator</h2>



<p>Matti then gave a live demonstration of <em>Somekone</em>. Nothing compares to seeing the tool in action, so do check out the video of his demo here!</p>



<p>Students log on to the tool and are presented with an Instagram-style feed of images. They scroll through the feed and like, share, or comment on images that catch their attention or match their interests. For many students this is a very familiar type of environment, and they really enjoy playing with the app!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-800x533.jpg" alt="Four young people sitting at their desks, on their mobile phones." class="wp-image-90246" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<p>However, the unique value of <em>Somekone</em> is that it provides students with a real-time view of the way data is collected from every single user interaction, and demonstrates what is done with that data. It also allows students to experiment with a social media tool in the classroom without any data protection issues, as all of the data is stored locally.</p>



<p>Learners explore:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Data collection in real time</strong>. Working in pairs, one student browses the image feed, while the other watches a live view of the data that the simulator is collecting every time their partner interacts with or simply pauses on a post.<br></li>



<li><strong>Profile building</strong>. <em>Somekone</em> shows how all this data accumulates to build a profile. Students watch their profiles developing based on the way they and their classmates are interacting with their feeds.<br></li>



<li><strong>Clustering and connections</strong>. Students then see how the tool groups profiles to create clusters of users with similar interests. Often friendship groups in the classroom are evident on screen because students sitting next to each other have all chosen to engage with the same things!</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><em>The simulator creates clusters of users with similar interests, which update in real time as students interact with posts on their feeds</em></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Explainable recommendations</strong>. A key feature of <em>Somekone</em> is that it provides explanations for why it recommends posts to users. Students learn that recommendations can be based on various things, such as the image’s tag matching the tag on other posts they liked, or the image being popular among other users with similar profiles to theirs. These are the mechanisms that underpin real recommendation systems, but <em>Somekone</em> makes them explicit.</li>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><em>The tool provides an explanation for why each post is recommended</em></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Filter bubbles and polarisation</strong>. A filter bubble forms when a user only sees social media posts that match their existing interests or beliefs, due to highly personalised recommendation systems. <em>Somekone</em> presents this concept in a visually compelling way through a heatmap showing all the content in the system, with a colour scale indicating which posts are most likely to be shown to a particular user, and which they will never encounter. By comparing different users’ filter bubbles side by side, students start to understand how polarisation can arise. As Matti said: “If our feeds are so different from each other that I never see the pictures that you see and you never see the pictures I see, then [&#8230;] we don&#8217;t even share the same reality”.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><em>Two users’ heatmaps presented side by side, showing their respective filter bubbles</em></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Algorithm settings</strong>. A key learning opportunity is that students can adjust the algorithm’s parameters and observe how this changes their feed and their filter bubble. They can choose between personalised or non-personalised recommendations, select how posts are ranked, and decide whether to allow any diversity in the popularity of posts recommended to them. This is key to ‘opening up the box’.</li>
</ul>



<p>For teachers, the tool has a simple guided interface to make it easy to use in class. There is also a button that teachers can use to pause the app, stopping students from scrolling (much to their dismay!) in order to focus their attention on the teacher when they are explaining concepts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Evidence of impact</h2>



<p>The research team used pre- and post-tests to evaluate what impact the intervention had on students’ understanding of social media mechanisms and on their sense of agency in relation to data. They conducted the post-test a week after the intervention, and then also did a delayed post-test six months later to see whether any changes were sustained. They found:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Improved understanding of key concepts</strong>. Learners showed statistically significant improvements in identifying different types of data traces and in understanding how data profiling works. They also showed some improvement in grasping recommendation mechanisms.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Retention over time</strong>. These improvements were generally still evident six months later, particularly in the case of understanding data traces.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stronger sense of agency</strong>. The team found that students’ sense of data agency improved after taking part in the intervention. This is really important as students are more likely to want to study a topic further if they have feelings of agency and self-efficacy.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Accessing the tool</h2>



<p>The <em>Somekone </em>tool is freely available online — in Finnish, English, German, and French — at <a href="https://somekone.gen-ai.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somekone.gen-ai.fi</a>. The developer Nick Pope has also made the source code available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/knicos/genai-somekone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">github.com/knicos/genai-somekone</a>. </p>



<p>However, the supporting materials and teacher resources are currently only available in Finnish and the underpinning pedagogies relate to the Finnish context.</p>

<p>We’re happy to celebrate National Engineering Day in the UK with our friends at the Royal Academy of Engineering. Today they launch the <a href="https://thisisengineering.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-Z of Engineering</a>, an online collection showcasing more than 100 current engineering jobs, and over 100 more engineering jobs envisaged for the future. Their aim is to inspire more young people to pursue engineering careers in areas ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics to medicine, software engineering, space, and sustainability.</p>

<p>Engineers shape the technologies and industries that define the future — and the systems they build affect jobs and tasks in every sector. As Sir John Lazar, President of the Royal Academy of Engineering and our Chair of Trustees, says about AI technology:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I’m not a believer that all jobs will just disappear because of AI. If you think of a job as an assemblage of tasks, there’s no question that the tasks in your job will change because AI will work with you on a bunch of things, and this will in turn reshape your job or role.&nbsp; The people who will thrive through this transformation will be those who engage with curiosity, intellectual rigour, scepticism, creativity, problem-solving and teamwork – and these are the skills and attitudes that are taught by engineering and computational thinking.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why kids still need to learn to code in the age of AI</strong></h2>



<p>At the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we believe <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-recognition-unesco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI literacy is crucial for all young people</a>. We also believe all young people need to learn to code to be able to shape our future, where AI systems are integrated into all aspects of life. Our position paper <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-kids-still-need-to-learn-to-code-in-the-age-of-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Why kids still need to learn to code in the age of AI</a>” presents five reasons why:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Even though AI tools can be used to generate code, we still need skilled human programmers to critically review that code.</li>



<li>Learning to code remains the most effective way to become a skilled human programmer, and allows better understanding of how computers work and what their potential and constraints are.</li>



<li>Learning to code will open up more economic opportunities, as advances in technology let us solve a wider range of problems using computers.</li>



<li>Coding is a literacy that gives young people agency and a new way to express themselves, to learn, and to make sense of the world.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Young people who learn to code now will shape the future, and we need that power to sit with young people from all backgrounds so they can design systems that serve everyone.</li>
</ol>



<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-to-coding-resources-to-help-children-learn-to-code-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our free resources for young people</a> help them learn to code and get creative with technology to bring their ideas into the world, building their confidence. So whether your kids are just starting their coding journey, or are looking for a new challenge, you can use our resources to support them.</p>

<p>Understanding coding and computers is critical in many engineering roles, so inspiring kids about engineering can also motivate them to try their hand at coding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How you can get involved with National Engineering Day</strong></h2>



<p>There are plenty of ways you can celebrate National Engineering Day. Inspire young people to embark on careers in engineering by sharing the <a href="https://thisisengineering.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-Z of Engineering collection</a> with your school or college, on social media, or on your organisation&#8217;s website. The collection is a living resource that will be updated, and contributions are always welcome — both for current jobs and future ones.To find out more ways to get involved with National Engineering Day, you can go <a href="https://raeng.org.uk/education-and-skills/this-is-engineering/national-engineering-day-resources/#:~:text=This%20year%2C%20National%20Engineering%20Day,play%20in%20shaping%20our%20world." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download the toolkit</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Highlights from Coolest Projects 2025</h2>



<p>More young people than ever took part in 2025, with 11,980 young people from 41 countries joining the <a href="https://online.coolestprojects.org/events/cp-2025/gallery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coolest Projects global online showcase</a>, a 57% increase from last year. We also hosted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZdbBJtsn5k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">livestream</a> celebrating all participants and announcing <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/coolest-projects-2025-where-11980-young-tech-creators-shared-their-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the judges’ favourites</a>, which has been watched by over 2,000 people. Plus, we expanded our in-person events, including <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/celebrating-young-innovators-at-coolest-projects-usa/">bringing Coolest Projects back to the USA</a> and running our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/young-creators-build-a-bright-future-at-coolest-projects-india-2025/">very first in-person event in India</a>.</p>



<p>This year saw significant growth in in-person events, with a record number of young people sharing their creations face-to-face. Across the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/young-tech-creators-take-over-bradford-at-coolest-projects-uk/">UK</a> and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/celebrating-young-tech-creators-at-coolest-projects-ireland-2025/">Ireland</a>, more than 200 young people showcased their projects to judges, families, and peers. Attendance at the UK event grew significantly compared to 2024, reflecting the strong enthusiasm for digital making, while the Ireland event continued to attract a dedicated community of young creators. This enthusiasm shows how much young people value being part of a creative, supportive community that helps them share ideas and develop their skills.</p>

<p>We were equally delighted to run Coolest Projects USA again, where young people embraced the chance to connect, share their work, and draw inspiration from one another. We also saw strong interest in the new AI category, with notable uptake at the UK and US events.</p>



<p>Participation by girls in the online showcase kept growing in 2025: 51% of entrants identified as female, up from 47% last year. We’re excited to build on this momentum and inspire even more girls to share their creations in 2026. We’ll continue encouraging participation by girls across all categories and broaden local promotion, especially where new in-person events are launching, to help maintain gender balance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Online showcase: Confidence, skills, and inspiration</h2>



<p>To understand Coolest Projects’ impact, we gathered survey and interview feedback from young creators, mentors, and event attendees across both the online showcase and in-person events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year’s online surveys and interviews indicate that Coolest Projects continues to be a powerful driver of confidence and skills:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>72% of young people and 100% of mentors agreed that participating increased confidence in coding and digital making</li>



<li>89% of young people reported improved coding and digital making skills</li>



<li>83% of young people (and 100% of mentors) said they felt inspired to continue with computing and digital making after taking part</li>
</ul>



<p>Young people and mentors told us that the online gallery plays a crucial role in sparking ideas and motivation:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Kids definitely were excited in knowing their project might be seen by other kids around the world and displayed publicly online, so it&#8217;s truly a way for them to feel recognised. It definitely motivated them too.” – Mentor, South Africa</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Coolest Projects truly offers a global setting like no other, giving young people the chance to see ideas from across the world and feel part of an inspiring international community.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In-person events: community and belonging</h2>



<p>Creators told us how special it felt to be surrounded by peers who love making with technology. They valued sharing their projects, meeting like-minded people, and getting ideas from others:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I think it’s really interesting seeing a lot of other children that understand programming and want to get better at it.” – Young creator, Coolest Projects USA</p>

<p>Survey data echoes this: 74% of young people said Coolest Projects helped them feel they belong in computing. Many also highlighted the wider skills they developed, from problem solving and creativity to communication and teamwork:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We [my friends and I] thought it was a really great opportunity and idea to make a project that we could all work on together and it&#8217;s been really awesome getting to know these girls and working together, fixing whatever code that we made wrong, debugging, you know…. We&#8217;d come together once a week to work on this project. So, I honestly got to learn a lot from them, watching them and how they code because they&#8217;re a little more advanced than I am. But, you know, that just means I get to learn more. So, you get to learn skills and support each other. It&#8217;s been awesome…”&nbsp; – Young creator, Coolest Projects USA</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Young people returning for another year described how they stretched themselves, from advanced Scratch techniques to experimenting with AI and robotics. They also said hands-on project work is better than passive learning every time.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“&#8230;It&#8217;s the journey on which I go through to create the robot. And through that journey, I seem to learn much more than say if I were to watch a YouTube video and not do anything practical with it. I learn much more if I physically get hands-on with robotics encoding.” – Young creator, Coolest Projects UK</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Alongside the projects on show, young people loved the interactive activities at events (with shout outs for VR and our escape room in the UK), and appreciated the friendly, approachable judges and smooth event setup. A new group registration system also made it much easier for mentors to enter multiple projects.</p>

<p>Read on to find out what resources and materials we have reviewed, and what concept themes we have identified.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is data science? Why is teaching it important?</h2>



<p>Data science is an interdisciplinary science of learning from large datasets, aided by modern computational tools and methods (<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40594-023-00397-9.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ow‑Yeong et al., 2023</a>). We see data science skills as fundamental for using, creating, and thinking critically about:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Insights from data, generally</li>



<li>Data-driven computational tools and methods (such as machine learning) and their outputs and predictions, specifically</li>
</ul>

<p>To navigate a world where decision making in many areas is influenced by data-driven insights and predictions, young people need to be taught about data science. Data science skills empower young people to become critical thinkers, discerning consumers, adaptable professionals, and informed citizens.</p>



<p>Worldwide, countries are taking a variety of approaches to introducing data science into their education systems, as highlighted in <a href="https://www.datascience4everyone.org/post/beyond-borders-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2024 report from the coalition Data Science 4 Everyone</a>.</p>

<p>In some countries, such as India and Israel, data science education is an established school subject. It is taught as part of the curriculum in at least one of the primary, secondary, or post-16 age phases. Meanwhile in other countries, for example Canada, Germany, and Poland, data science is a very new school subject, or there are still only recommendations to develop it into a school subject.</p>



<p>While we are currently considering what a comprehensive data science curriculum should include, we already offer several resources to support you with your teaching about data science and data-driven technologies. You can find a list of these resources at the end of this blog. Now, however, I&#8217;ll give you an overview of our recent work to identify concepts for a data science curriculum that fits with our approach to AI literacy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Data science education: What should we teach?</h2>



<p>To answer the question &#8216;What should we teach about data science to learners aged 5 to 19?&#8217;, we undertook a grey literature review of data science teaching materials. A grey literature review is structured like an academic literature review and conducted with the same rigour. The difference is that a grey literature review also considers publications that have not been peer-reviewed, including reports, white papers, curriculum materials, and similar resources.</p>



<p>To orient our work, we combined four frameworks for data science and AI/ML education:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Data Science 4 Everyone’s <a href="https://www.datascience4everyone.org/learningprogressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Science Learning Progressions</a></li>



<li>Two research papers from Viktoriya Olari and Ralf Romeike about data-related practices for AI education: <a href="https://computingeducation.de/pub/2024_Olari-Romeike_Computers_Education_Open.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Olari and Romeike (2024a)</a> and <a href="https://computingeducation.de/pub/2024_Olari-Romeike_WiPSCE2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Olari and Romeike (2024b)</a></li>



<li>UNESCO’s <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/ai-competency-framework-students" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI Competency Framework for Students</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The SEAME framework</a> we developed for categorising AI education resources</li>
</ul>



<p>With these combined frameworks as our map, we reviewed 79 data science learning resources. The resources varied:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In quality in terms of clarity and teaching approach</li>



<li>In their focus, e.g. on maths, coding, or a specific field such as biology</li>



<li>In their perspective on data science, with some prioritising theory and others real-world applications</li>
</ul>



<p>From among the 79 resources, we chose 9 that included clear learning outcomes, and that together covered a wide field of concepts. We examined these 9 in detail to extract 181 explicit and implicit data science concepts. Next, we grouped the concepts into themes, and finally we refined these themes by comparing them against the four frameworks listed above.</p>



<p>The themes we have identified for a data science curriculum are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Fundamentals of data literacy: Key terms and definitions</li>



<li>Understanding bias in data</li>



<li>Ethical responsibility in data use</li>



<li>Data creation, curation, and transformation</li>



<li>Analysis and modelling: Maths and statistics fundamentals</li>



<li>ML principles</li>



<li>Deploying and maintaining ML applications</li>



<li>Software tools and programming</li>



<li>Data visualisation</li>



<li>Presenting findings effectively</li>
</ul>



<p>This set of themes both fits with the frameworks by Olari and Romeike and Data Science 4 Everyone, and expands them by covering ML principles and programming approaches and calling out data bias and ethics.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s next for this work?</h2>



<p>Through our grey literature review on data science education, we&#8217;ve:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Pinpointed a large set of candidate concepts that could be taught within a data science curriculum</li>



<li>Created a set of clear themes to structure our work going forward</li>
</ul>



<p>Our next step is to shape these candidate concepts into a progression framework to describe their relationships and establish which concepts could be taught at each age or phase of schooling.</p>

<p>The literature review also gave us an overview of the pedagogical approaches and tools used for teaching data science concepts. These findings will become useful once we start designing learning activities.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll hear more about how this work is going here on our blog and on our social channels. In the meantime, comment below to let us know what you think about the themes, or to tell us what you&#8217;d like to see in a data science curriculum for the learners you work with.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Blockly?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Blockly is a free, open source library that enables developers to build applications and websites that use block-based coding interfaces. That means that instead of typing code, you snap blocks together to build programs. Behind the scenes, those blocks are turned into text-based code like JavaScript and Python.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockly started life in 2011 in Google as a passion project of one engineer. Since then — thanks to the generous support of Google, a small team of brilliant engineers, and an amazing community of open source contributors and partners — it has grown to become the de facto standard for visual programming interfaces.</p>



<p>In particular, Blockly is the foundation for pretty much all of the block-based coding applications that you may have used to teach or learn about programming. Platforms like Scratch, MakeCode, and MIT&#8217;s App Inventor are all built with Blockly. It&#8217;s no exaggeration to say that hundreds of millions of young people have learnt the fundamentals of computer science using software that is built with Blockly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we enter the age of AI, it is more important than ever that all young people develop a foundational understanding of computer science. Blockly and the block-based coding platforms and applications that it enables are essential to realising that vision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can read more about the importance of coding in the age of AI in our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-kids-still-need-to-learn-to-code-in-the-age-of-ai/">position paper</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockly is also widely used to create interfaces that control hardware and robotics platforms. And, while its main use cases are in education, Blockly is increasingly being used to build industrial and commercial applications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does this change mean?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>From 10 November 2025, the Blockly open source library and assets, and key members of the Blockly team will transition from Google to the Raspberry Pi Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our vision is for Blockly to continue to be the standard visual programming interface that makes coding accessible to all. We are committed to maintaining Blockly as an open source project, and to working collaboratively with the community of developers and educators.</p>

<p>Over the next year, we will roll out features that improve accessibility, including screen reader support and keyboard navigation, working closely with partners to support implementation of these accessibility improvements across their platforms.</p>



<p>Looking to the future, we want to make sure that Blockly is at the leading edge of innovations that support the teaching and learning of programming in the age of AI. We&#8217;re also excited about the potential for the Blockly team to collaborate with the Foundation&#8217;s research, learning, and product teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are already part of the community of developers and educators, then I want to reassure you that you can continue to expect the same outstanding partnership and support from the Blockly team. We also look forward to welcoming many more members to the Blockly community over the coming years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, I want to say a huge thank you to Google for their support for Blockly over the years, and for enabling this transition with generous grant funding.&nbsp;</p>
