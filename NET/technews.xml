<p>So tune in this week, then stay tuned!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who features in this episode, and what will I learn?</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve got tips from three teachers whose articles feature in <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/hello-world/issues/26">Hello World&#8217;s newest magazine issue</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Katie Dahlman from Bloomington, MN, USA</h3>



<p>Get ready for some top tips from Katie Dahlman, a preschool teacher and Digital Learning Specialist in Bloomington Public Schools in Minnesota, USA. With over 16 years of experience as an early childhood educator, Katie has dedicated her time to developing engaging computer science (CS) lessons for young learners.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="500" height="490" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2481-1-500x490.jpeg" alt="Headshot of Katie Dahlamn, a guest teacher who featured on the 'Teacher tips: Digital literacy' episode of the Hello World podcast." class="wp-image-89847" style="width:400px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2481-1-500x490.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2481-1-255x250.jpeg 255w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2481-1-768x752.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2481-1-1536x1505.jpeg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2481-1-2048x2006.jpeg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2481-1-800x784.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2481-1-450x441.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2481-1-900x882.jpeg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Katie believes that digital literacy starts with building foundational skills to prepare students for their roles as digital citizens. One of the tips Katie shares in the episode emphasises the importance of integrating computational thinking into the classroom:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">

<p>Curt explains in the podcast that digital literacy is about equipping students with the necessary skills to use technology effectively in everyday situations and the workplace. He also shares an important tip for teachers, encouraging them to give students regular chances to engage in hands-on learning:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&nbsp;“Make sure that you&#8217;re providing consistent opportunities for creation and exploration within your classes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Halima Bhayat, London, UK</h3>



<p>The episode also features Halima Bhayat, the Head of Computing and Digital T Levels at Ursuline High School in London, UK. Halima is an Asian Women of Achievement 2021 Finalist, a digit&lt;all&gt; ambassador, an Amazon teacher, and the Computing at School Merton lead for all schools.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="500" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-4-500x500.png" alt="Headshot of Halima Bhayat, a guest teacher who featured on the 'Teacher tips: Digital literacy' episode of the Hello World podcast." class="wp-image-89854" style="width:400px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-4-500x500.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-4-250x250.png 250w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-4-150x150.png 150w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-4-768x768.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-4-800x800.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-4-100x100.png 100w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-4-300x300.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-4-450x450.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-4-900x900.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-4.png 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>With a wealth of experience, she emphasises that digital literacy is more than about using technology — it&#8217;s about understanding how the digital world functions, how technology shapes our daily lives, and how it impacts individuals and communities.</p>



<p>One of Halima’s top tips for enhancing digital literacy in the classroom is to focus on touch typing. She believes that students should be equipped with fast and efficient typing skills, as so many tasks today are online.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“My first tip would be to get [your students] touch typing, get them to start becoming faster with their fingers on those keyboards, because lots of things have become online.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Read Halima&#8217;s article &#8216;From switches to success’ on pages 76–77 of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/hello-world/issues/26">Issue 26</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>



<p>We are thrilled to announce that the Raspberry Pi Foundation (RPF) has been accepted as a member of UNESCO’s Global Education Coalition (GEC).&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="802" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1.jpeg" alt="Global Education Coalition." class="wp-image-89794" style="width:742px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1.jpeg 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-500x251.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-768x385.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-1536x770.jpeg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-800x400.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-450x226.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-900x451.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div>


<p>Initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when 1.6 billion learners were shut out of the classroom, the GEC aimed to provide continuity of education in times of crisis. Since then, the Coalition has grown into a global multistakeholder network, and we are proud to help drive education transformation and accelerate the path to achieving <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/sdgs">UNESCO’s Sustainable Development</a> Goal 4 (SDG 4 – Quality Education).</p>



<p>UNESCO’s vision to transform education for the world’s most underserved aligns with our mission at the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Being part of the Coalition enables us to work together to achieve this shared aim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to being part of the GEC, we have been invited to join the Digital Transformation Collaborative (DTC), a tech-focused subgroup that empowers educators and education leaders to include emerging technologies in their teaching practices and decision-making through capacity building and training.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coalition achievements</strong></h2>



<p>We’re joining a coalition that has already achieved a lot. Having attended the GEC annual conference last week in Paris, Ms Stefania Giannini, UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Education, stated that to date the GTC has:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Helped over 858,898 youth develop skills that make them more employable</li>



<li>Trained 794,580 teachers</li>



<li>Offered learning resources to more than 1,000,000 learners studying foundational subjects, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics</li>



<li>Reached 2,459,192 of the most marginalised girls and women</li>
</ul>



<p>Source: <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/global-education-coalition">https://www.unesco.org/en/global-education-coalition</a></p>



<p>Whilst these are amazing achievements to celebrate, there is still more work to do, with Ms Giannini also highlighting that there are currently 251 million children and youth out of school and that 44 million more teachers are needed for universal primary and secondary education by 2030.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We often believe we understand the meaning of ‘digital literacy’, but it can be a misleading term. Do we mean digital skills? Online safety? Where does AI fit in? As computer science education evolves to meet the needs of our increasingly digital world, we believe that true digital literacy empowers young people to engage with technology thoughtfully, critically, and confidently.</p>



<p>In this issue of Hello World, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org//hello-world/issues/26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out today for free</a>, we discuss what digital literacy means, how it is taught in different countries around the world, and how educators are rethinking digital literacy for their students and themselves.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital literacy</strong></h2>



<p>As the use of digital technology grows, a broader view of digital literacy is necessary. Digital literacy is more than knowing how to use software. It’s the ability to use digital technologies effectively, safely, and responsibly.</p>



<p>In Issue 26 of Hello World, we explore this topic in detail and hear insights from educators across the world, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Becci Peters shares how Computing at School (CAS) in the UK is supporting digital literacy skills for students and educators</li>



<li>Sourav Pattanayak discusses how digital literacy is defined in India, and the formal and informal ways educators are teaching digital literacy</li>



<li>Sandra Hartman explores strategies for enhancing digital literacy in the US</li>



<li>Gavin Davenport asks what would happen if we considered digital literacy in the same way as we consider traditional literacy</li>
</ul>

<p>The week after, Tuesday 22 April, you’ll be able to hear a brilliant conversation between the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s Chief Learning Officer, Rachel Arthur, and two special guests: Dr Jessica Hamer from King&#8217;s College London&#8217;s School of Education, Communication and Society, and Becky Patel from Tech She Can. They’ll be discussing the current state of girls’ engagement in computing — a wide-reaching and important conversation exploring how we can empower more girls in computing through school, university and their careers.</p>



<p>Then on Tuesday 29 April the final episode in the miniseries will be a panel debate about “digital natives” where we’ll be asking, ‘Are young people who grew up with technology around them truly tech-savvy, or are they dependent on digital tools without understanding how they work?’ James Robinson — Senior Learning Manager here at the Raspberry Pi Foundation and regular host of the podcast — will lead this discussion as global educators debate the myth of the &#8220;digital native,&#8221; uncover how it could overlook complex issues of access, skills, and education, and consider what it really takes to be tech-smart in the modern world.</p>

<p>Teaching about artificial intelligence (AI) is a growing challenge for educators around the world. In our current seminar series, we are gaining insights from international computing education researchers on how to teach about AI and data science in the classroom. In our second seminar, Franz Jetzinger from the Technical University of Munich, Germany, presented his work on supporting teachers to integrate AI into their classrooms. Franz brings a wealth of relevant experience to his research as an accomplished textbook author and K–12 computer science teacher.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="629" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-500x629.jpeg" alt="A photo of Franz Jetzinger in a library. " class="wp-image-89766" style="width:460px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-500x629.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-199x250.jpeg 199w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-768x967.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-800x1007.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-450x566.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-900x1133.jpeg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image.jpeg 1125w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Franz started by demonstrating how widespread AI systems and technologies are becoming. He argued that embedding lessons about AI in the classroom presents three challenges:&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>What</strong> to teach (defining AI and learning content)</li>



<li><strong>How</strong> to teach (i.e. appropriate pedagogies)</li>



<li><strong>How to prepare teachers</strong> (i.e. effective professional development)&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>As various models and frameworks for teaching about AI already exist, Franz’s research aims to address the second and third challenges — there is a notable lack of empirical evidence integrating AI in K–12 settings or teacher professional development (PD) to support teachers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Using professional development to help prepare teachers</strong></h2>



<p>In Bavaria, computer science (CS) has been a compulsory high school subject for over 20 years. However, a recent update has brought compulsory CS lessons (including AI) to Year 11 students (15–16 years old). Competencies targeted in the new curriculum include defining AI, explaining the functionality of different machine learning algorithms, and understanding how artificial neurons work.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04.jpg" alt="Two students are seated at a desk, collaborating on a computing task." class="wp-image-87821" style="width:640px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04.jpg 1920w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure></div>


<p>To help prepare teachers to effectively teach this new curriculum and about AI, Franz and colleagues derived a set of core competencies to be used along with existing frameworks (e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33019795">the Five Big Ideas of AI</a>) and the Bavarian curriculum. The PD programme Franz and colleagues developed was shaped by a set of key design principles:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Blended learning</strong>: A blended format was chosen to address the need for scalability and limited resources and to enable self-directed and active learning&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Dual-level pedagogy (or ‘pedagogical double-decker’)</strong>: Teachers were taught with the same materials to be used in the classroom to aid familiarity</li>



<li><strong>Advanced organiser</strong>: A broad overview document was created to support teachers learning new topics&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Moodle</strong>: An online learning platform was used to enable collaboration and communication via a MOOC (massive open online course)</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Analysing the effectiveness of the PD programme</strong></h2>



<p>Over 300 teachers attended the MOOC, which had an introductory session beforehand and a follow-up workshop. The programme’s effectiveness was evaluated with a pre/post assessment where teachers completed a survey of 15 closed, multiple-choice questions on their AI competencies and knowledge. Pre/post comparisons showed teachers’ scores improved significantly having taken part in the PD. This is surprising as a large proportion of participants achieved high pre-scores, indicating a highly motivated cohort with notable prior experience teaching about AI.</p>



<p>Additionally, a group of teachers (<em>n</em>=9) were invited to give feedback on which aspects of the PD programme they felt contributed to the success of implementing the curriculum in the classroom. They reported that the PD programme supported content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge well, but they required additional support to design suitable learning assessments.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Using action research to aid AI teaching&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>A separate strand of Franz’s research focuses on the other key challenge of how to effectively teach about AI. Franz engaged teachers (<em>n</em>=14) in action research, a method whereby teachers engage in classroom-based research projects. The project explored what topic-specific difficulties students faced during the lessons and how teachers adapted their teaching to overcome these challenges.</p>

<p>Findings revealed that students struggled with determining whether AI would benefit certain tasks (e.g. object recognition, text-to-speech) or not (e.g. GPS positioning, sorting data). Franz and colleagues reasoned that students were largely not aware of how AI systems deal with uncertainty and overestimated their capabilities. Therefore, an important step in teaching students about AI is defining ‘what an AI problem is’.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1225" height="816" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4.png" alt="A teenager learning computer science." class="wp-image-83499" style="width:644px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4.png 1225w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-300x200.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-500x333.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-768x512.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-800x533.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-450x300.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-900x600.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1225px) 100vw, 1225px" /></figure></div>


<p>Similarly, students struggled with distinguishing between rule-based and data-driven approaches, believing in some cases that a trained model becomes ‘rule-based’ or that all data models are data-driven. Students also struggled with certain data science concepts, such as hyperparameter, overfitting and underfitting, and information gain. Franz’s team argue that the chosen tool, Orange Data Mining, did not provide an appropriate scaffold for encountering these concepts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, teachers found challenges in bringing real-world examples into the classroom, including the use of reinforcement learning and neural networks. Franz and colleagues reasoned that focusing on the function of neural networks, as opposed to their structure, would aid student understanding. The use of high-quality (i.e. well-prepared) real-world data sets was also suggested as a strategy for bridging theoretical ideas with practical examples.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Addressing the challenges of teaching AI</strong></h2>



<p>Franz’s research provides important insights into the discipline-specific challenges educators face when introducing AI into the classroom. It also underscores the importance of appropriate professional development and age-appropriate and research-informed materials and tools to support students engaging with ideas about AI, data science, and machine learning.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation has been working in India since 2018 to enable young people to realise their potential through the power of computing and digital technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve supported Code Clubs, partnered with government organisations, and designed and delivered a complete computing curriculum for students in grades 6 to 12 and at the undergraduate level. Our curriculum is tailored to the Indian context, and we provide extensive support to help teachers deliver it effectively.</p>

<p>In another <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/computing-curriculum-framework-adapting-to-indias-diverse-landscapes/">recent blog</a>, we shared in detail how we’ve created an impactful curriculum for India. We&#8217;re now excited to share our new report evaluating how our curriculum is being taught in Telangana and Odisha. This report demonstrates the impact we&#8217;ve had so far, highlighting our successes and the key lessons we have learnt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key findings from the evaluation</strong></h2>



<p>Our evaluations of how the curriculum is being taught show that teachers are well-equipped to deliver the curriculum and provide high-quality and accessible learning experiences that develop students’ computing knowledge and skills.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="767" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR.jpg" alt="A group of students in a classroom." class="wp-image-89141" style="width:706px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR-300x230.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR-500x384.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR-768x589.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR-800x614.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR-450x345.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR-900x690.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>In Telangana, we partnered with the Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TGSWREIS) to introduce our curriculum at the Coding Academy School and Coding Academy College. Our report found that all school and college teachers we trained agreed they felt confident teaching students using the resources provided. Students were very positive about the classes, and their assessment scores demonstrated strong learning outcomes: 77% of school students and 70% of college students achieved at least 60% of available marks.</p>

<p>In Odisha, we worked with Learning Links Foundation and Quest Alliance, in partnership with Panchasakha Sikhya Setu (PSS) Abhiyan, to deliver the IT and Coding Curriculum (Kaushali) to students in grades 9 and 10. Our findings were also very positive:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>87% of teacher respondents agreed that the curriculum resources were high quality and useful for their teaching</li>



<li>91% felt more confident about teaching IT and coding due to the curriculum resources</li>



<li>93% of teachers agreed that the training helped them understand the curriculum&#8217;s structure, content, and objectives</li>



<li>89% felt confident in teaching the curriculum after the training</li>



<li>Teachers also reported a positive impact on their students, with almost all agreeing that it improved students&#8217; coding skills, digital literacy, and understanding of responsible digital citizenship</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1370" height="742" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-89729" style="width:628px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png 1370w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1-300x162.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1-500x271.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1-768x416.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1-800x433.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1-450x244.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1-900x487.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1370px) 100vw, 1370px" /></figure></div>


<p>The report also highlights how students better understood how computing and coding are used in the world and developed an increased interest in pursuing careers in these fields.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key factors for effective implementation</strong></h2>



<p>Our evaluations show the importance of several factors when launching a computing curriculum:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Aligning content with students&#8217; experience and interests:</strong> Content should be tailored to students&#8217; existing knowledge, culturally relevant, and follow industry standards to prepare them for employment</li>



<li><strong>Providing extensive support to teachers:</strong> This includes careful selection and training of master teachers, comprehensive training for teachers that considers their knowledge and experience, and ongoing support through webinars, calls, and classroom observations</li>



<li><strong>Ensuring sufficient quantity and quality of infrastructure:</strong> Adequate equipment and internet access are crucial for effective teaching and learning</li>
</ul>



<p>We are committed to always improving our approach to ensure that all young people in India have the opportunity to learn about computing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Join us in shaping the future</strong></h2>

<p>I am delighted to announce Experience CS, a free, integrated computer science curriculum for elementary and middle school students (8–14 years old) that will be available in June 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experience CS enables educators to teach computer science through a standards-aligned curriculum that integrates computer science concepts and knowledge into core subjects like maths, science, languages, and the arts.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="651" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025.jpg" alt="An educator helps students with a coding task." class="wp-image-89708" style="width:690px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-500x326.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-800x521.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-450x293.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-900x586.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>This cross-curricular and integrated approach is one of the most effective ways to provide younger students with an introduction to computer science and is increasingly important as the impact of digital technology reaches every corner of our lives. We also know that embedding CS in real-world contexts helps make it meaningful and relevant for students, which is essential if we are going to inspire kids from different backgrounds to want to learn more about computer science and technology.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Built by educators, for educators&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The team behind Experience CS includes educators with significant experience of teaching CS in elementary and middle school settings and everything we do is being informed by the world&#8217;s leading research into effective pedagogy as well as extensive testing and research in classrooms. This won&#8217;t stop when we launch. We will continue to develop and improve the curriculum and resources in response to feedback from teachers and students.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="668" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020.jpg" alt="Two students use computers in a classroom." class="wp-image-89706" style="width:694px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020-450x301.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020-900x601.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>One of the most important design principles for Experience CS is that it can be used by any educator. You don&#8217;t need a CS qualification or any previous experience in teaching CS classes to deliver engaging and creative learning experiences for your students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will provide lesson plans, classroom resources, and an online platform that is designed to be easy and safe to use. We will also provide educators with professional development to help build their confidence, knowledge, and skills. You don&#8217;t need to adapt or amend the resources to use them, but you will be able to if you want to. We trust teachers to know what is best for their classrooms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A creative and safe learning experience&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Crucially, Experience CS will be a creative learning experience. We&#8217;ve all seen those apps and platforms that purport to teach computer science by having young people direct their favourite pop culture character around a maze. While those types of games can be fun, we think that they fail to convey the creative potential of computer science and leave more students feeling &#8220;why bother&#8221; rather than being inspired to learn more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why Experience CS includes self-directed creative projects using the popular programming platform Scratch, with clear instructions and endless opportunities for young people to express themselves creatively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We know that online safety is the most important consideration for schools, teachers, and parents, which is why we have built a version of Scratch that is safe for schools. That means it won&#8217;t have the community and sharing features that are so central to the full Scratch platform. It will come with simple and intuitive classroom management features that enable teachers to create accounts, set assignments, review progress, and provide feedback to students.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Free forever, for everyone</strong></h2>



<p>Our promise is that Experience CS will be available for teachers and students anywhere in the world to use for free, for as long as you need it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially, we are developing the curriculum and resources for the US and Canadian education systems and we will be mapping the lessons to national and local standards in both countries. The materials will all be available in English, French, and Spanish. We will also be focusing our professional development and support for schools in the US and Canada, including working with a fantastic network of educational partners.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building on the legacy of CS First</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></h2>



<p>We are delighted that Experience CS is supported by Google and that we are able to build on the fantastic work that they have done over many years to support educators and students through CS First.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google has today announced that CS First will no longer be available from June 30, 2025 and that they are recommending that their users should move over to Experience CS for the next school year. That is a huge vote of confidence from a team that really knows what they are talking about. I want to pay tribute to everyone at Google who has worked so hard over the years to support teachers and inspire students through CS First.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are looking forward to working with all of the CS First community to make sure that you are supported through the transition and set up ready to go for the start of the new school year. You can find out more about the support we will be offering by registering <a href="https://experience-cs.org/?utm_source=rpf&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=exp-cs-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>As adults, it’s easy for us to see the impact technology has had on society and on our lives. Yet when I tell pupils that, within my lifetime, it wasn’t always illegal to hold your mobile phone to your ear and have a call while driving, they are horrified. They are living in the now and don’t yet have the perspective to allow them to see the change that has happened.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1500" height="1012" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/BARROWHILL_CC4282.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-89026" style="width:678px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/BARROWHILL_CC4282.jpg 1500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/BARROWHILL_CC4282-300x202.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/BARROWHILL_CC4282-500x337.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/BARROWHILL_CC4282-768x518.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/BARROWHILL_CC4282-800x540.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/BARROWHILL_CC4282-450x304.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/11/BARROWHILL_CC4282-900x607.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></figure></div>


<p>With the greater understanding we now have of technology and its impact, we can better learn from previous mistakes, make decisions around ethical behaviour (such as whether to use a phone while driving), and critically engage in real-world issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As teachers, allocating some time to this topic throughout the year can seem challenging, but by implementing a few small changes, the benefits might be more than you imagine. Here are three ways you can help your students explore the impact of technology.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Change the format of your lessons by stepping away from devices&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>As teachers know, some computing lessons work best when students don’t use devices, whether it’s a matter of students designing programs before starting to code them, drawing&nbsp; maps of their school network, or discussing the implications of bias in AI training models. It’s important that learners recognise that computers are tools — sometimes they allow us to do and achieve great things, but sometimes there are other approaches that are more suitable.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1778" height="1170" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024.jpg" alt="A group of young people investigate computer hardware together." class="wp-image-81490" style="width:682px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024.jpg 1778w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-500x329.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-1536x1011.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-800x526.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-450x296.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-900x592.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1778px) 100vw, 1778px" /></figure></div>


<p>Spending time discussing the impact of technology can help learners decide for themselves when technology is an asset, and when it is a burden. Another advantage of changing the format of your computing lessons away from device usage is that they may appeal to a wider range of students. While some students may not be interested in using technology, they may enjoy debating ethics, discussing world events, or finding solutions to real-world problems — all of which can take centre stage in a more discussion-focused computing lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach can also demonstrate to your class that lots of different skill sets are needed in the computing industry, and inspire your learners to consider career paths they might have otherwise dismissed. In addition, open, discussion-based lessons can give your learners food for thought, encouraging them to approach tasks in subsequent lessons with a greater appreciation of broader issues — whether they’re designing a program, deciding what features to build into a website, or how to structure a database.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Connect your lessons to real-world events</strong></h3>



<p>Young people exist in an interesting space when it comes to world events. Even if they’re not engaged in current affairs, they’ll probably still encounter a lot of content about what’s happening in the world. They may see snippets of news footage on television, hear adults talking about a big event, or — with so much of their lives now happening online — stumble across trending stories and associated opinions while using social media, apps, and websites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-scaled.jpg" alt="Close up of two young people working at a computer." class="wp-image-89303" style="width:684px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure></div>


<p>Young people will often try to make sense of all these bits of information, filling in the blanks. The problem is that if we don’t talk to young people about what they’re hearing, they may fill in the blanks incorrectly. Before you know it, they might be anxious that artificial intelligence will take over the world, or that adults hate TikTok for no reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to equip young people with the skills to think about real-world events — and developments related to technology — critically and calmly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Headlines such as “Why the USA is banning TikTok” or self-help articles with titles like “Why muting people on social media will change your life” could make brilliant focus points for a lesson or activity about the impact of technology. Discussing these kinds of headlines and articles can help your learners consider their own opinions, apply what they know about how technology works, and gain a sense of grounding in our often turbulent world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By encouraging your learners to articulate what they know and apply it to real-world situations, you’ll enrich their computing education while also nurturing responsible digital citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Encourage students to have difficult conversations</strong></h3>



<p>The role of a computing teacher is often broad. Beyond curriculum and teaching responsibilities, it will usually involve providing tech support (changing ink in printers, for instance) and dealing with safeguarding incidents that have happened between pupils at the weekend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Safeguarding is a key part of teaching. Effective safeguarding should include teaching your learners about what to do in difficult scenarios, like when a WhatsApp group goes awry, when an image is shared on social media when it shouldn’t have been, or when a game becomes popular that your learners aren’t old enough to play.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541.jpeg" alt="Computing teachers often have to be prepared with a lesson to deal with safeguarding incidents, such as a WhatsApp group gone awry." class="wp-image-89641" style="width:669px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541.jpeg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541-500x334.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541-900x600.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Computing teachers often have to be prepared with a lesson to deal with safeguarding incidents, such as a WhatsApp group gone awry.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Each of these scenarios is an example of technology’s impact on our lives. It’s important that your learners know how to deal with these scenarios and can have different opinions while talking and listening to each other. Also, if your learners can do these things, it will make things easier in the future if you need to talk to a particular learner about something inappropriate they’ve done.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By encouraging your learners to have difficult conversations, you’ll practise how to navigate the tension between legality, rules from home, and best-practice advice from external sources. You’ll also have lessons that you can refer back to: “Remember when we were discussing the TikTok ban? How might some of those conversations relate to this situation? What about when we discussed when to block people on games or on social media? Would that be appropriate here?”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Raising awareness that the impact of technology can enrich lessons</strong></h2>



<p>Technology is going to continue to impact the lives of the pupils we work with, whether they can recognise that or not. Increasing their awareness of the impact technology is having, in both positive and negative ways, will enrich your lessons, show that content is relevant to your learners, and help protect them when they have to make their own critical decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are suggestions in this article to use with learners of all ages, but if you want more support on how to teach the topic with older learners, we have an online course for educators (<strong>helloworld.cc/impactoftech</strong>) and a unit of work for 14-year-olds (<strong>helloworld.cc/ks4impact</strong>).</p>

<p>Earlier this month, young creators gathered at the Sport Ireland Campus National Indoor Training Centre in Dublin for Coolest Projects Ireland 2025, an inspiring showcase of creativity, coding, and problem solving. With more than 80 participants sharing over 60 incredible projects, this year’s event highlighted the passion and innovation of young creators from across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.</p>



<p>The day offered the chance for young people to share their digital projects, engage with a like-minded community, chat with VIP judges, and take part in exciting coding activities like <a href="https://astro-pi.org/mission-zero" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Pi Mission Zero</a>. The event was once again supported by Meta, who sponsored the new AI category, continuing their commitment to promoting the importance of digital skills to young people.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Celebrating creativity </strong></h2>



<p>Coolest Projects is a space for all digital projects, across all levels and categories, from hardware inventions to AI to Scratch. The event celebrates not just the finished products, but also the learning journeys of young creators and skills such as problems solving and creativity.</p>



<p>Helen Gardner, Programme Manager at the Raspberry Pi Foundation, shared her enthusiasm about this year’s showcase:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Returning to Dublin for Coolest Projects is always such a joy! It’s incredible to see the enthusiasm, creativity, and talent of young creators as they bring their ideas to life. This event is all about celebrating the community and inspiring the next generation of problem-solvers. It’s always so inspiring to witness their amazing projects and the energy they bring to the day!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Participants at Coolest Projects Ireland included young people from schools, coding clubs such as Code Club and CoderDojo, and independent makers. Many were returning participants, excited to showcase their latest projects and connect with fellow creators. The sense of community and encouragement was felt throughout the event, with mentors, parents, and judges offering valuable support and feedback to support growth and celebrate achievements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Spotlight on the judges favourites</strong></h2>



<p>This year, judges were particularly impressed with the originality and impact of the projects. We caught up with four of the creators to find out why being involved in Coolest Projects Ireland was important to them.</p>

<p><br>Sister duo, Riddhiba and Aarushiba, created Innovaid, a project that uses technology to improve safety at events.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We wanted to solve a problem that was affecting a large number of people. Having read news articles, and having talked to people who have had bad experiences at concerts and large events, we wanted to solve this problem that has been ongoing for many years. Although technology has advanced rapidly in the past years, there are still flaws in large event management leading to incidents and deaths. We wanted to incorporate safety, medical aid, crowd management, and inclusivity.”</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Coolest Projects Ireland was an amazing experience for both of us, we got the opportunity to meet with so many people that were so passionate about technology and coding. We met many people who also wanted to make a change in society, or wanted to solve problems.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Coolest Projects also welcomed an AI category, supported by Meta, for the first time, which included Kirsty’s entry, A haon, dó, trí – Learn with me. Kirsty’s entry used machine learning to help learners master the Irish language in an engaging and interactive way. Kirsty shared a little about her journey with the project</p>

<p>Leo Porter and Daniel Zingaro have spearheaded this transformation through their groundbreaking undergraduate programming course. Their innovative curriculum integrates GenAI tools to help students tackle complex programming tasks while developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills.</p>



<p>Leo and Daniel presented their work at the Raspberry Pi Foundation research seminar in December 2024. During the seminar, it became clear that much could be learnt from their work, with their insights having particular relevance for teachers in secondary education thinking about using GenAI in their programming classes</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Practical applications in the classroom</h2>



<p>In 2023, Leo and Daniel <a href="http://bit.ly/CS1-LLMs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced GitHub Copilot in their introductory programming&nbsp; CS1-LLM course</a> at UC San Diego with 550 students. The course included creative, open-ended projects that allowed students to explore their interests while applying the skills they’d learnt. The projects covered the following areas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Data science</strong>: Students used Kaggle datasets to explore questions related to their fields of study — for example, neuroscience majors analysed stroke data. The projects encouraged interdisciplinary thinking and practical applications of programming.</li>



<li><strong>Image manipulation</strong>: Students worked with the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to create collages and apply filters to images, showcasing their creativity and technical skills.</li>



<li><strong>Game development</strong>: A project focused on designing text-based games encouraged students to break down problems into manageable components while using AI tools to generate and debug code.</li>
</ul>



<p>Students consistently reported that these projects were not only enjoyable but also responsible for deepening their understanding of programming concepts. A majority (74%) found the projects helpful or extremely helpful for their learning. One student noted that.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;<em>Programming projects were fun and the amount of <strong>freedom</strong> that was given added to that. The projects also helped me understand how to put <strong>everything that we have learned</strong> so far into a project that I could be proud of.</em>&#8220;</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Core skills for programming with Generative AI</strong></h2>



<p>Leo and Daniel emphasised that teaching programming with GenAI involves fostering a mix of traditional and AI-specific skills.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="294" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image3-500x294.png" alt="Infographic highlighting a workflow when writing software with Copilot." class="wp-image-89597" style="width:646px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image3-500x294.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image3-300x176.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image3-768x451.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image3-450x264.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image3.png 781w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Writing software with GenAI applications, such as Copilot, needs to be approached differently to traditional programming tasks</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Their approach centres on six core competencies:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Prompting and function design</strong>: Students learn to articulate precise prompts for AI tools, honing their ability to describe a function’s purpose, inputs, and outputs, for instance. This clarity improves the output from the AI tool and reinforces students’ understanding of task requirements.</li>



<li><strong>Code reading and selection</strong>: AI tools can produce any number of solutions, and each will be different, requiring students to evaluate the options critically. Students are taught to identify which solution is most likely to solve their problem effectively.</li>



<li><strong>Code testing and debugging</strong>: Students practise open- and closed-box testing, learning to identify edge cases and debug code using tools like doctest and the VS Code debugger.</li>



<li><strong>Problem decomposition</strong>: Breaking down large projects into smaller functions is essential. For instance, when designing a text-based game, students might separate tasks into input handling, game state updates, and rendering functions.</li>



<li><strong>Leveraging modules</strong>: Students explore new programming domains and identify useful libraries through interactions with Copilot. This prepares them to solve problems efficiently and creatively.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Ethical and metacognitive skills</strong>: Students engage in discussions about responsible AI use and reflect on the decisions they make when collaborating with AI tools.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="247" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image6-500x247.png" alt="Graphic depicting students' confidence levels regarding their programming skills and their use of Generative AI tools." class="wp-image-89598" style="width:617px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image6-500x247.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image6-300x148.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image6-450x222.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image6.png 729w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Adapting assessments for the AI era</strong></h2>



<p>The rise of GenAI has prompted educators to rethink how they assess programming skills. In the CS1-LLM course, traditional take-home assignments were de-emphasised in favour of assessments that focused on process and understanding.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="273" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image2-500x273.png" alt="Table highlighting the different types of assessments involved in Leo and Daniel's course." class="wp-image-89599" style="width:583px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image2-500x273.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image2-300x164.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image2-450x246.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image2.png 745w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Leo and Daniel chose several types of assessments — some involved having to complete programming tasks with the help of GenAI tools, while others had to be completed without.</figcaption></figure></div>


<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Quizzes and exams</strong>: Students were evaluated on their ability to read, test, and debug code — skills critical for working effectively with AI tools. Final exams included both tasks that required independent coding and tasks that required use of Copilot.</li>



<li><strong>Creative projects</strong>: Students submitted projects alongside a video explanation of their process, emphasising problem decomposition and testing. This approach highlighted the importance of critical thinking over rote memorisation.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Challenges and lessons learnt</strong></h2>



<p>While Leo and Daniel reported that the integration of AI tools into their course has been largely successful, it has also introduced challenges. Surveys revealed that some students felt overly dependent on AI tools, expressing concerns about their ability to code independently. Addressing this will require striking a balance between leveraging AI tools and reinforcing foundational skills.</p>



<p>Additionally, ethical concerns around AI use, such as plagiarism and intellectual property, must be addressed. Leo and Daniel incorporated discussions about these issues into their curriculum to ensure students understand the broader implications of working with AI technologies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A future-oriented approach</strong></h2>



<p>Leo and Daniel’s work demonstrates that GenAI can transform programming education, making it more inclusive, engaging, and relevant. Their course attracted a diverse cohort of students, as well as students traditionally underrepresented in computer science — 52% of the students were female and 66% were not majoring in computer science — highlighting the potential of AI-powered learning to broaden participation in computer science.</p>

<p>In April 2023, we <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-launch-lessons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched our first Experience AI resources</a>, developed in partnership with Google DeepMind to support educators to engage their students in learning about the topic of AI. Since then, the Experience AI programme has grown rapidly, reaching thousands of educators all over the world. Read on to find out more about the impact of our resources, and what we are learning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Experience AI resources</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/02/Experience-AI-2-5.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-89580" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/02/Experience-AI-2-5.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/02/Experience-AI-2-5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/02/Experience-AI-2-5-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>The <a href="http://rpf.io/expai-impactblog1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI resources</a> are designed to help educators introduce AI and AI safety to 11- to 14-year-olds. They consist of:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Foundations of AI</strong>: a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-launch-lessons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comprehensive unit of six lessons</a> including lesson plans, slide decks, activities, videos, and more to support educators to introduce AI and machine learning to young people</li>



<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-new-updated-lessons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Two standalone lessons</a>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Large language models (LLMs)</strong>: a lesson designed to help young people discover how large language models work, their benefits, and why their outputs are not always reliable</li>



<li><strong>Ecosystems and AI — Biology</strong>: a lesson providing an opportunity for young people to explore how AI applications are supporting animal conservation</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>AI safety</strong>:<strong> </strong>a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/helping-young-people-navigate-ai-safely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set of resources with a flexible design</a> to support educators in a range of settings to equip young people with the knowledge and skills to responsibly and safely navigate the challenges associated with AI</li>
</ul>



<p>We also offer a free online course, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/free-online-course-on-understanding-ai-for-educators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Understanding AI for educators</a>, to help educators prepare to teach about AI.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>International expansion</strong></h2>



<p>The launch of Experience AI came at an important time: AI technologies are playing an ever-growing role in our everyday lives, so it is crucial for young people to gain the understanding and skills they need to critically engage with these technologies. While the resources were initially designed for use by educators in the UK, they immediately attracted interest from educators across the world, as well as individuals wanting to learn about AI. The resources have now been downloaded over 325,000 times by people from over 160 countries. This includes downloads from over 7000 educators worldwide, who will collectively reach an estimated 1.2 million young people.</p>

<p>Thanks to funding from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-canada-kenya-romania/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google DeepMind</a> and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-expands-to-reach-over-2-million-students/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google.org</a>, we have also been working with <a href="http://rpf.io/expai-impactblog2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partners from across the globe</a> to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/localising-ai-education-adapting-experience-ai-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">localise</a> and translate the resources for learners and educators in their countries, and provide training to support local educators to deliver the lessons. The educational resources are now available in up to 15 languages, and to date, we have trained over 100 representatives from 20 international partner organisations, who will go on to train local educators. Five of these organisations have begun onward training already, collectively training over 1500 local educators so far.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The impact of Experience AI</strong></h2>



<p>The Experience AI resources have been well received by students and educators. Based on responses to our follow-up surveys, in <a href="https://experience-ai.org/en/partners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countries where we have partners</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>95% of educators agreed that the Experience AI sessions have increased their students’ knowledge of AI concepts&nbsp;</li>



<li>90% of young people (including young people in formal and non-formal education settings and learning independently) indicated that they better understand what AI and machine learning are</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are we learning?</strong></h2>



<p>We are committed to continually improving our resources based on feedback from users. A recent review of feedback from educators highlighted key aspects of the resources that educators value most, as well as some challenges educators are facing and possible areas for improvement. For example, educators particularly like the interactive aspects, the clear structure and explanations, and the videos featuring professionals from the AI industry. We are continuing to look for ways we can better support educators to adapt the content and language to better support students in their context, fit Experience AI into their school timetables, and overcome technical barriers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We value feedback on our resources and will continue to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/the-need-to-invest-in-ai-skills-in-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highlight the importance of AI education in schools</a> and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-expands-to-reach-over-2-million-students/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work with partners across the globe to adapt our resources for different contexts</a>.</p>
