<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Experience AI?</h2>



<p><a href="https://experience-ai.org/">Experience AI</a> is a free educational programme that helps teachers and students learn about artificial intelligence (AI). It was developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in partnership with Google DeepMind and includes lessons, classroom resources, and hands-on activities to help students develop a foundational understanding of AI technologies, their social and ethical implications, and the role that AI can play in their lives.</p>



<p>It is based on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/">original research into AI literacy</a> and highlights real-world applications of AI technologies, including through videos featuring research scientists that help to bring the lessons to life for students.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-800x600.png" alt="A group of students and educators at Penang Science Cluster's launch of Experience AI in Malaysia." class="wp-image-87201" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-800x600.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-300x225.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-500x375.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-768x576.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-450x338.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-900x675.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A group of students and educators at the launch of Experience AI in Malaysia.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Since we launched the first Experience AI resources in April 2023, they have been used to teach over 2 million students, and that number is growing fast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This reach is possible thanks to a global network of <a href="https://experience-ai.org/en/partners">Experience AI education partners</a> who work with us to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/localising-ai-education-adapting-experience-ai-resources/">localise and translate the resources</a> and deliver large-scale teacher training in their regions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">UNESCO recognition</h2>



<p>Experience AI was one of four laureates of the prestigious global Prize selected by the Director-General of UNESCO, based on recommendations from an independent, international jury. The jury commended the programme for its strong ethical&nbsp;foundation and wide international reach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year, marking its 20th anniversary, the Prize focused on the theme ‘Preparing learners and teachers for the ethical and responsible use of artificial intelligence’.</p>

<p>The Prize was awarded at a ceremony at the University of Bahrain attended by the Director-General of UNESCO, Ministers of Education of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and members of the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Google DeepMind teams.</p>



<p>I want to say a heartfelt congratulations and thank you to everyone who has worked on Experience AI so far. It has been a fantastic, collaborative effort from colleagues across the Foundation, Google DeepMind, and all of our partner organisations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also want to pay tribute to all of the teachers — all over the world — who have engaged so enthusiastically with Experience AI, for helping us develop the materials, including testing them in your classrooms and providing such thoughtful feedback, and for everything you do, every day, to inspire your students. This recognition is for all of your hard work, diligence, and care. Congratulations and thank you.</p>

<p>Experience AI is provided at no cost to schools, teachers, or students thanks to generous funding from Google.org. We are also very grateful to Broadcom Foundation, which has provided additional funding to support the programme. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What next for Experience AI?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We are exceptionally proud to have received this recognition for Experience AI, but we aren&#8217;t complacent. Equipping all young people, and their teachers, with a foundational understanding of AI technologies is one of the most urgent challenges facing all education systems.</p>



<p>We have made a great start, and we know there is much more to be done. That&#8217;s why we have lots of important updates and developments coming soon, including:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Updating and improving the current lessons:</strong> We are finalising an update to the resources to respond to feedback from teachers and students, including significant improvements to make them more accessible. These will be published early in 2026.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Expanding the range of lessons:</strong> Alongside the updates to the existing resources, we are developing new lessons. This will include lessons designed for both younger and older learners, as well as integrated lessons that enable teachers to bring AI concepts and skills into subjects such as science, language, and the arts.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Updated and improved professional development:</strong> We are also updating and improving the training that we offer to teachers, including both online courses and webinars, and in-person training delivered through the global network of education partners.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>AI chatbot for educators:</strong> We recently integrated a chatbot into the Experience AI website. Powered by Gemini 2.5, this is intended as a tool to help teachers navigate and understand the concepts and lessons. This is an early experiment and we&#8217;d love to get your feedback, so please give it a try and let us know what you think.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Expanding the global network of partners:</strong> We currently have partners supporting teacher professional development in 25 countries, from Malaysia to Mexico. Over the coming year we will be launching partnerships in at least 15 more countries. If your organisation is interested in becoming a partner, you can let us know by <a href="https://form.raspberrypi.org/4873612">filling in this form</a>.</li>

<p>In August, young tech creators from across Sri Lanka gathered for the country’s second-ever in-person Coolest Projects event, hosted by our partner <a href="https://stemup.lk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">STEMUP Educational Foundation</a>. The showcase was a chance for young people to share and celebrate their ideas and inventions with families, friends, mentors, and the wider digital making community, while having lots of fun trying out projects and meeting fellow creators.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9997.jpg" alt="Coolest Projects Sri Lanka 2025." class="wp-image-91706" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9997.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9997-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9997-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9997-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9997-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<p>With 150 projects showcased by 200 young people, the event highlighted the incredible creativity and problem-solving skills that come into play when young people have an opportunity to get hands-on with technology and explore their curiosity. It was great to be there on the day and hear from the creators themselves. From a cake chase game (that was really about the importance of friendship) to an AI-powered classifier that could identify organic and non-organic material, there was no shortage of imagination on display.</p>



<p>Here are just a few of the standout projects I saw at the event.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="490" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1679.png" alt="The Robot Bag project at Coolest Projects Sri Lanka." class="wp-image-91695" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1679.png 600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1679-300x245.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1679-500x408.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1679-450x368.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Udula | Robot Bag, Hardware category</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Inspired by young people carrying heavy backpacks full of textbooks, Udula created ‘Robot Bag’ to help people of all ages carry their bags. You simply place your bag on the robot, and it will start following you around! One challenge Udula faced was trying to figure out how far the robot was from people. With just one camera, the robot could not really determine depth, so it could not detect how far away a walking person was. To solve this, he added two more cameras at an angle. This allowed him to calculate a more accurate average distance using input from all three cameras.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="700" height="525" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1656.png" alt="The Ripley’s Adventure: Beyond the Horizon project at Coolest Projects Sri Lanka." class="wp-image-91696" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1656.png 700w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1656-300x225.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1656-500x375.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1656-450x338.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Yahya | Ripley’s Adventure: Beyond the Horizon, Scratch category</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Yahya built an astronaut reaction time game that followed Ripley, an astronaut in training. In order to pass his training, he had to hit as many moving targets as possible in one minute. Thankfully, Yahya had built an adjustable difficulty level, so I could complete the challenge in spite of my slow reaction times!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685.png" alt="The Jellyfish or Plastic Bag? project at Coolest Projects Sri Lanka." class="wp-image-91697" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685.png 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685-300x225.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685-500x375.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685-768x576.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685-800x600.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685-450x338.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685-900x675.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Khadeejah | Jellyfish or Plastic Bag? AI to Differentiate Jellyfish from Plastic Bags, AI category</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Khadeejah is passionate about the environment and learned that ocean clean-up technology tools often incorrectly identify jellyfish and plastic bags. Underwater, they have a lot of the same characteristics and movements: they are translucent, flexible, and amorphous. She started creating her own dataset and training her own AI model to distinguish between the two. In doing so, she learned a lot about AI bias and how creating a balanced dataset is really important to prevent bias and improve accuracy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Young people leading the way</strong></h2>



<p>From beginners to experienced programmers, every young creator at the event had the chance to celebrate their work, talk about their ideas, and see what others were building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having so many young creators in one space highlighted the importance of providing opportunities where they can share ideas, learn from one another, and build a sense of community. We would like to say a huge thank you to STEMUP Educational Foundation for organising such an inspiring day, and to the volunteers and mentors who made the event possible. Most importantly, thank you to the young digital makers of Sri Lanka for sharing your creativity with us. We can’t wait to see what you will make next!</p>

<p>Simon Peyton Jones, British computer scientist and Member of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, says in his article &#8216;Programming the Future&#8217;:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Designing and writing software is one of the most demanding, intellectually stretching tasks that humans undertake. If we build a building, we are limited by the strength of steel — we can only make the tower so high before it will fall under its own weight. But software knows no such limits. The only limit is our own ability (or inability) to manage the complexity of the systems we build. That is humbling — but also exciting.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Coolest Projects India is officially a wrap, and we are absolutely thrilled with the results! The event, held on 20 September 2025 in Hyderabad, Telangana, was a fantastic showcase of the incredible talent and passion of young creators. With over 250 participants, young creators showcased 118 projects, demonstrating the thriving digital making community across India.</p>



<p>The projects on display were truly inspirational, tackling important topics such as environmental sustainability and the responsible use of AI. From hardware to Scratch to AI, creators showcased an incredible variety of projects that brought their ideas to life, from simple creations to complex inventions.</p>



<p>Here are just a few of the standout projects from the day.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252.jpg" alt="Young creators at Coolest Projects India." class="wp-image-91650" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252-500x282.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252-900x507.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Avyukt, 9 years old | The EchoCharm Spellbox, Hardware category</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A truly magical project was <strong>The EchoCharm Spellbox</strong>, an interactive creation that used a Raspberry Pi computer and a speaker to bring the famous Harry Potter artifact to life. This project was a perfect blend of creativity and coding, showcasing how technology can be used for fun and entertainment.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114.jpg" alt="Young creators at Coolest Projects India." class="wp-image-91651" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Aahil, 11 | Automatic Seed Sowbot, Hardware category</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>We were also blown away by the <strong>Automatic Seed Sowbot,</strong> a practical invention that used a tiny camera and AI to quickly and accurately sort seeds. This clever hardware project tackles a real-world problem and has fantastic applications in agriculture and farming.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231.jpg" alt="Young creators at Coolest Projects India." class="wp-image-91652" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231-500x282.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231-900x507.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pranamya, Medha, Manvi, Aradhna — these 13-year-old-girls all come from Karnataka state | Unspoken Truths, Mobile apps category</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Another brilliant project that we saw was <strong>Unspoken Truths</strong>, a fun mobile app for interesting conversations to reveal hidden truths and secrets about yourself and your friends. If you&#8217;re ever looking to break the ice or deepen your connections, Unspoken Truth provides an entertaining way to start a conversation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A community of creators</h2>



<p>From first-time coders to seasoned programmers, every young person showcasing their work had the chance to celebrate their ideas and feel part of a vibrant community. The event created a unique atmosphere where participants were able to proudly share their projects with family, friends, and the wider coding community. They all received certificates to celebrate their fantastic achievements.</p>



<p>This year’s showcase brought together creators from different parts of the country, highlighting the incredible passion for digital making in India. It was a powerful reminder that when you put technology into the hands of young people with curiosity, there is no limit to what they can create.</p>



<p>A massive thank you to our organisers, volunteers, and the dedicated mentors who made the event possible. And most importantly, thank you to the young creators of India for sharing their ingenuity and creativity with us! We can&#8217;t wait to see what you’ll build next.</p>



<p>Thank you to our sponsors, Qube Research and Technologies, for sponsoring the hardware category.</p>

<p>The Global Clubs Partner network brings together 52 partners from 45 countries, all working together to positively impact their local communities and open up opportunities for the next generation.</p>



<p>Last month, our Global Clubs Partners came together in Sri Lanka for our annual meetup, celebrating collaboration and community. Hosted alongside the second-ever Coolest Projects Sri Lanka, the gathering brought partners from across the world to share ideas, learn together, and build connections that will carry into the year ahead.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526.jpg" alt="A group of educators at a conference." class="wp-image-91620" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building connections across the network</strong></h2>



<p>The in-person meetups are all about strengthening the sense of community among Global Clubs Partners. Ellie Proffitt from the RPF Global Partners team shared why coming together is so important:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It was wonderful to hear everyone’s experiences and connect over <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our shared mission.</a> Everyone was so keen to learn from each other, and being able to do that face to face made it even more valuable.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Sri Lanka meetup gave partners the space to get to know one another, learn from each other’s experiences, and think together about future goals for their clubs.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551.jpg" alt="Educators collaborate together during a workshop." class="wp-image-91621" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exploring together</strong></h2>



<p>The agenda combined presentations, workshops, and plenty of time for discussion. It began with the Raspberry Pi Foundation team giving a presentation on our mission and strategy for partner work and beyond. Afterwards, each organisation introduced themselves and partners showcased their activities and successes. Together we explored how to build and sustain Code Club communities, experimented with creative ways to use AI in clubs, and got hands-on with unplugged activities that make computing accessible in low-tech settings. Partners also shared approaches to adapting content for their local contexts, and finished by developing their own vision and strategy for the next 12 months.</p>



<p>The variety of sessions meant there was something for everyone, whether partners were looking for new teaching ideas, strategic guidance, or inspiration from peers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“There were so many interesting topics, I wish we had more time to go more in depth. I love being able to speak with other organisations doing similar work. Having the Raspberry Pi Foundation facilitate the connections is an asset.” – Global Partner</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inspiring moments at Coolest Projects Sri Lanka</strong></h2>



<p>As part of the meetup, partners had the chance to attend Coolest Projects Sri Lanka 2025, where young people showcased their incredible tech creations. Seeing children proudly present projects ranging from apps to hardware builds was a highlight for many.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are shaping our world in many ways. Helping young people develop AI literacy — in other words, helping them understand how AI tools work and how to use them responsibly — is essential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we’re committed to empowering educators around the world with everything they need to teach AI confidently and help young people develop AI literacy. That’s why we developed Experience AI: a set of high-quality AI literacy resources designed in collaboration with Google DeepMind that any educator can use, no matter their level of tech knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="850" height="478" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5.png" alt="AI Quests" class="wp-image-91578" style="width:743px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5.png 850w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-450x253.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></figure></div>


<p>We’re excited to introduce a new addition to the Experience AI resources: AI Quests.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enter AI Quests</h2>



<p>Developed by Google Research in collaboration with the Stanford Accelerator for Learning, AI Quests is a browser-based learning experience that lets students step into the role of AI researchers. Through interactive, story-driven activities, they’ll explore essential AI topics such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Data preparation</li>



<li>Testing and evaluation</li>



<li>Bias in AI systems</li>
</ul>



<p>Students will use what they learn about these topics to tackle simulated global challenges. The first quest, Market Marshes, introduces them to how AI technology can be used in flood forecasting, while upcoming quests will explore other real-world issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why AI Quests matters</h2>



<p>AI technology is frequently used but often poorly understood. AI Quests, like Experience AI more broadly, gives students practical experience of how AI technology works, and shows why it’s so important.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Quest-1-Welcome-to-Market-Marshes-8.png" alt="Market Marshes AI Quest start screen" class="wp-image-91590" style="width:692px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>Here’s what sets AI Quests apart:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Gamified learning: Storytelling and role play turn abstract ideas into immersive experiences<br></li>



<li>Real-world relevance: Students see how AI technology addresses challenges like climate resilience and health equity<br></li>



<li>No prior knowledge required: Any teacher, regardless of subject specialism, can bring AI Quests into their classroom<br></li>



<li>Developed by experts: Built with Google Research and the Stanford Accelerator for Learning, content is high-quality and credible</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s next</h2>



<p>AI Quests is launching in English, with future plans for translations and additional quests to reach even more learners globally.</p>



<p>To support educators, we’re also hosting two free webinars on YouTube and LinkedIn:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>9 October at 4pm BST</li>



<li>16 October at 4pm BST</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tom Mason</strong> is Head of Mathematics and Head of ICT at St Joseph’s College, an all-boys secondary school in South East London. He is passionate about teaching and learning, and has a keen interest in digital education practices.</p>



<p>Mr Mason recently set his Year 10 students a creative coding challenge, which they completed using our <a href="https://editor.raspberrypi.org/en/education" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Editor for Education</a>. The challenge not only boosted student engagement, but also showcased the effectiveness of open-ended, student-led learning in computer science education.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="553" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-500x553.jpg" alt="Tom Mason" class="wp-image-91557" style="width:520px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-500x553.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-226x250.jpg 226w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-768x849.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-800x885.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-450x498.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-900x995.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason.jpg 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Challenges in the classroom</strong></h2>



<p>Teaching coding in a classroom setting presents a unique set of challenges, with one of the most significant being the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Instead of engaging deeply with concepts like loops, conditions, and sorting algorithms, students now increasingly rely on AI tools to generate entire blocks of code for them, without understanding their functions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, traditional teacher-led instruction methods that focus on isolated coding concepts like inputs and outputs often leave students disconnected from the practical and creative aspects of programming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Against this backdrop, Mr Mason wanted to give his students the opportunity to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Apply their Python knowledge in meaningful ways</li>



<li>Collaborate and problem-solve independently</li>



<li>Explore unfamiliar programming concepts in a guided but open-ended fashion</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The project</strong></h2>



<p>Mr Mason set a simple but powerful brief:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Over three lessons, build a quiz that asks 10 questions about what you’ve learnt on the course.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With this simple instruction, Mr Mason gave students a clear idea about what to do, while giving them the freedom to design their quiz however they liked. Students were also told that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Their 10 quiz questions had to relate to Python</li>



<li>After creating their quiz, their classmates would give feedback based on key criteria (how well the code worked, the level of creativity, the user experience, etc.)</li>
</ul>



<p>To complete the project, students used<strong> </strong>the Code Editor for Education. Created in collaboration with educators and built purposefully for the classroom, the Code Editor supports a range of teaching styles and learning abilities. Its simple interface encourages students to engage with the logic behind their code — they can’t rely on autocomplete.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="810" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3.png" alt="Code Editor dashboard" class="wp-image-91554" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3.png 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-300x152.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-500x253.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-768x389.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-1536x778.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-800x405.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-450x228.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-900x456.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Results</strong></h2>



<p>The open-ended structure led to an explosion of creativity and problem-solving.<strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>Without step-by-step instructions, students had to independently explore solutions to questions like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“How do I randomise questions?”</li>



<li>“How can I hide quiz answers in a separate file?”</li>
</ul>



<p>Some students created multi-file Python projects, separating the logic controlling how the quiz worked from the content, or static information. For example, some students created one file to store the player’s answers and another file to manage the quiz interface and score logic. Students also created other advanced features:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Score tracking based on speed of response</li>



<li>Use of external Python libraries</li>



<li>Custom input and output formatting</li>



<li>Algorithms to randomly order quiz questions </li>
</ul>



<p>All students met the base requirements, but the open-ended nature of the project allowed more advanced students to push the boundaries, without the need for additional scaffolding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Educator reflection</strong></h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“They couldn’t just Google the answer; they had to think critically and test ideas. That’s what made it powerful.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mr Mason noted that the project’s success was due in large part to the flexibility and responsiveness of the Code Editor. Students could iterate quickly, test their ideas, and collaborate, all within a platform built for classroom coding.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It was the most successful thing I’ve done. I’ll definitely be doing it again every year.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key takeaways</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Project-based learning</strong> fosters deeper engagement and knowledge, and creative application of programming concepts.<br></li>



<li><strong>Open-ended prompts</strong> empower students to explore and develop their own solutions.<br></li>



<li><strong>Code Editor for Education</strong> encourages thoughtful questions and experimentation rather than reliance on autocomplete solutions. With built-in class management and project tools, it offers a safe, browser-based environment ideal for coding in the classroom.</li>
</ul>



<p>Join St Joseph’s College and the 1300+ other schools helping their students build a strong foundation in text-based programming with the Code Editor for Education.</p>

<p>In classrooms across Mexico, a transformation is unfolding. The Experience AI programme isn’t just teaching students about artificial intelligence, it’s empowering teachers and learners to explore, question, and create with it. By equipping educators with accessible tools and sparking curiosity among students, the initiative is shaping a new generation ready to use AI responsibly and creatively.</p>

<p>Educators like Guadalupe Cortes, Lilia Violeta Garvia Sanchez, Ines Martinez, and Ana Judith Zavaleta are at the forefront of this shift. Their experiences reveal just how transformative Experience AI has become.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">From fear to fascination: Demystifying AI</h2>



<p>For many, AI can feel abstract, something from science fiction. Science and math teacher Lilia Violeta Garvia Sanchez remembers that both she and her students once viewed AI as “robots that would take over the world.” Fear gave way to fascination, however, once Experience AI entered the classroom.</p>



<p>Through hands-on lessons, students quickly discovered AI as a practical tool rather than a threat. “I’ve seen a change in the students,” Lilia explains. “They were afraid at first, but now they’re curious and engaged.”</p>



<p>Technology teacher Ines Martinez admits she was also surprised: “I thought the language would be more technical or complex, but it was pleasantly accessible — and very useful.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Equipping educators with tools that work</h2>



<p>A defining strength of Experience AI is its adaptability. Teachers can tailor materials to fit their classrooms while still leaning on the program’s robust foundation.</p>



<p>Guadalupe Cortes points to the built-in glossary as a game-changer: “It was really helpful for me.” She values being able to choose what fits her teaching to keep it relevant: “I selected certain parts to connect with projects I was already running.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sparking critical thinking and ethical awareness</h2>



<p>Experience AI pushes students to think deeply about the ethics and implications of AI.</p>



<p>In Ines’s class, students raised concerns about water use in data centres and debated how to protect their digital identities. They weren’t just learning facts, they were making connections to real-world issues.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1494" height="759" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-13.19.20-1.png" alt="Educator supporting young learner in the classroom" class="wp-image-91509" style="width:726px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-13.19.20-1.png 1494w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-13.19.20-1-300x152.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-13.19.20-1-500x254.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-13.19.20-1-768x390.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-13.19.20-1-800x406.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-13.19.20-1-450x229.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-22-at-13.19.20-1-900x457.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1494px) 100vw, 1494px" /></figure></div>


<p>Another teacher, Ileana Beurini, described an exercise where students asked different AI models the same political question. When answers varied, they discussed bias and the importance of consulting multiple sources. In another activity, searching images of “worker” led to a conversation about gender equity in technology.</p>



<p>As Ines puts it: “They don’t want it to do all the thinking for them. They said it should be a support — a tool to generate better information, not to replace reasoning or reflection.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Transforming engagement and performance</h2>



<p>The impact on student motivation has been striking. For Ana Judith Zavaleta, the shift was clear: “They’re much more hands-on now — they don’t rely as much on textbooks or theory.” One student who typically struggled academically became one of the most enthusiastic participants, even passing where he previously failed.</p>



<p>Guadalupe Cortes has seen similar enthusiasm: “They’re finding a real purpose in using AI for their own benefit.” At an entrepreneurship fair, her students applied AI concepts to improve their projects, proof that these lessons extend far beyond the classroom.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A call to action for educators</h2>



<p>The teachers’ message is unanimous: embrace AI.</p>



<p>“We should give it a try,” urges Lilia. “Just because we’re teachers doesn’t mean we have to know everything. The world is evolving every single day, and we need to innovate with our students so they feel motivated to keep learning.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="321" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Mexico-Exp-AI-1.png" alt="Young learners work on the classroom wall" class="wp-image-91513" style="width:726px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Mexico-Exp-AI-1.png 600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Mexico-Exp-AI-1-300x161.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Mexico-Exp-AI-1-500x268.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Mexico-Exp-AI-1-450x241.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure></div>


<p>For Ines, the takeaway is simple but powerful: “Take the risk — really, take the chance to learn. Just like the internet became essential, AI will become part of our daily lives and necessary for all areas of teaching — and life itself.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">More than just a set of resources</h2>



<p>Experience AI is more than a set of resources, it’s a movement preparing students to navigate the future with curiosity, critical thinking, and ethical awareness. By igniting minds in Mexico, it’s helping to cultivate responsible digital citizens who will shape not just their classrooms, but the world beyond them.</p>

<p>We love hearing from members of the community and sharing the stories of amazing young people, volunteers, and educators who are using their passion for technology to create positive change in the world around them.</p>



<p>Marie is a force of nature. As the founder of Breadline London, a grassroots community project in Haringey, she has spent years supporting families with essential services — she’s run a food bank, offered budgeting advice, and hosted well-being workshops. But when she heard about Code Club, she saw another way to help local children: by giving them the skills to shape their futures.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="My coding story: Marie | From tech beginner to Code Club mentor" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZB1pbQJJj8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From community support to coding</strong></h2>



<p>Marie had no background in tech, but that didn’t stop her. She knew that many families in Tottenham couldn’t afford extracurricular activities like coding classes, and she was determined to change that.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I&#8217;ve wanted a coding club for children, children in Tottenham, because that’s not something that is actually here,” she explains. “Unfortunately for us, we are on the very high end of poverty… and some of our children in this area don&#8217;t get the opportunity to attend things like coding club.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With the support of Haringey Giving and the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Marie launched her Code Club at Tottenham Community Sports Centre. She started from scratch, learning alongside the kids, attending free training at the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s headquarters in Cambridge, and soaking up everything she could about coding.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I don’t know anything about coding. Nothing. But going to the training days, it was so inspiring. I got so excited thinking, these are the things I can hopefully share with the children.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Creating a space to experiment</strong></h2>



<p>Marie’s club is more than just learning how to code — it’s about teamwork, creativity, and confidence.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4.jpg" alt="Marie helps a young learner with a coding task in her Code Club." class="wp-image-91489" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“They need to learn these skills outside of a school environment, outside of a place where it’s really structured. I want them to come in, experiment, make things up as they go along. Sometimes they follow instructions, but mostly, they just try things out.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She also sees her role as a mentor, even if the kids sometimes know more than she does!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Most of the children know more about coding than I do. So for me, it’s just about encouraging them: ‘What’s next? What else can you add to your project?’ And helping parents understand that they need to let the children create what they want to create, not just steer them.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Discovering Coolest Projects</strong></h2>



<p>Marie’s journey didn’t stop with Code Club. When she learnt about Coolest Projects, a global showcase where kids celebrate what they’ve built with code, she knew she had to take her club to one of the in-person events.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2.jpg" alt="Marie helps a young learner with a coding task in her Code Club." class="wp-image-91492" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I was in Cambridge when I first heard about it, and this fabulous young woman spoke about Coolest Projects. I just felt so excited to take the children somewhere that’s just kids, just kids learning about coding and developing these amazing things. I even said, ‘Even if no one from my club comes, I’m going by myself!’”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Taking the kids to Coolest Projects was a game-changer. They saw what was possible, talked to other young coders, and left inspired.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Next year, when we go again, everybody’s going to have a project. Seeing the kids’ faces when adults wanted to try their projects, it was so exciting for them!”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Making a change</strong></h2>



<p>Marie is proof that you don’t need to be a tech expert to start a Code Club — you just need passion and a willingness to learn.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2.jpg" alt="Two educators are chatting at a workshop." class="wp-image-91493" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>Marie’s message to others who are thinking about setting up a coding club but worry about their lack of experience is simple:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Start a [Code Club] because the children will help you to run [it]. They will help you. They will help each other. Don’t get put off running a coding club because you don’t know how to code. Because I don’t[…]and I love it.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Marie’s story is a testament to what’s possible when someone believes in their community and takes action. She is creating opportunities for young people in Tottenham, giving them a space to learn, collaborate, and dream big regardless of their background. We can’t wait to see what her club achieves next!</p>
