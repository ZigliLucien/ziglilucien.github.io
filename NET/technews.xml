<p>Thousands of learners worldwide take their first steps into text-based programming using the Python programming language. Python is not only beginner-friendly, but is also used extensively in industry.</p>

<p>In 2015, Python developer Daniel Pope, who has a keen interest in education, noticed that beginners often have great ideas for creating projects but struggle because the software libraries they need to use are aimed at more confident programmers. To address this, he created <a href="https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#">Pygame Zero</a> — a simplified version of the popular PyGame software. Since then, various developers have expanded the range of &#8216;zero&#8217; libraries for Python.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Python zero libraries help beginner programmers</strong></h2>



<p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation has a long history of supporting Python zero libraries. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/gpio-zero-a-friendly-python-api-for-physical-computing/">GPIO Zero</a> was launched back in 2015, followed by <a href="https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/">guizero</a> and then <a href="https://picozero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">picozero</a>. The goal of all &#8216;zero&#8217; libraries is the same: to help beginner programmers create amazing projects using simple, understandable code, supported by useful documentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Picamera2 library is a powerful tool for advanced users, but beginners — such as <a href="https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab">Astro Pi: Mission Space Lab</a> programme participants — would benefit from a zero library to allow them to use the Raspberry Pi Camera module.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Picamzero: how to get started</strong></h2>



<p>The Code Club Projects and Youth Programmes teams at the Raspberry Pi Foundation have joined forces to create<strong> <code>picamzero</code></strong>: a new library that makes it simple for beginners to use the Raspberry Pi Camera board.</p>



<p>As with the other &#8216;zero&#8217; libraries, it’s straightforward to get started. You can install picamzero by typing two commands in your Raspberry Pi&#8217;s terminal:</p>



<p><code>sudo apt update</code></p>



<p><code>sudo apt install python3-picamzero</code></p>



<p>Once it&#8217;s installed, setting up your program to communicate with your camera is easy:</p>



<p><code>from picamzero import Camera</code></p>



<p><code>cam = Camera()</code></p>



<p>You can ask picamzero to take a time-lapse sequence and make a video of your images using a single line of code.</p>



<p><code>cam.capture_sequence("mysequence.jpg", make_video=True)</code></p>



<p>Picamzero also makes it easy to add text and image overlays to your images.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to change many areas of our lives, with new AI technologies and software having the potential to significantly impact the way programming is taught at schools. In our seminar series this year, we’ve already heard about <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/using-an-ai-code-generator-with-school-age-beginner-programmers/">new AI code generators</a> that can support and motivate young people when learning to code, AI tools that can create <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/supporting-learners-with-programming-tasks-through-ai-generated-parsons-problems/">personalised Parson’s Problems</a>, and research into <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/error-message-explanations-large-language-models-teachers-views/">how generative AI could improve young people’s understanding of program error messages</a>.</p>

<p>At times, it can seem like everything is being automated with AI. However, there are some parts of learning to program that cannot (and probably should not) be automated, such as understanding errors in code and how to fix them. Manually typing code might not be necessary in the future, but it will still be crucial to understand the code that is being generated and how to improve and develop it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As important as debugging might be for the future of programming, it’s still often the task most disliked by novice programmers. Even if program error messages can be explained in the future or tools like LitterBox can flag bugs in an engaging way, actually <strong>fixing</strong> the issues involves time, effort, and resilience — which can be hard to come by at the end of a computing lesson in the late afternoon with 30 students crammed into an IT room.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="195" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7-500x195.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88651" style="width:605px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7-500x195.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7-300x117.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7-768x299.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7-800x311.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7-450x175.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-7.png 897w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Debugging can be challenging in many different ways and it is important to understand why students struggle to be able to support them better.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But what is it about debugging that young people find so hard, even when they’re given enough time to do it? And how can we make debugging a more motivating experience for young people? These are two of the questions that Laurie Gale, a PhD student at the Raspberry Pi Computing Education Research Centre, focused on in our July seminar.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Why do students find debugging hard?</h1>



<p>Laurie has spent the past two years talking to teachers and students and developing tools (a <a href="https://github.com/LaurieGale10/program-logs-viewer">visualiser of students&#8217; programming behaviour</a> and <a href="https://primmdebug.web.app/">PRIMMDebug</a>, a teaching process and tool for debugging) to understand why many secondary school students struggle with debugging. It has quickly become clear through his research that most issues are due to problematic debugging strategies and students’ negative experiences and attitudes.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="426" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-500x426.jpeg" alt="A photograph of Laurie Gale. " class="wp-image-88652" style="width:628px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-500x426.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-294x250.jpeg 294w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-768x654.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-1536x1308.jpeg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-800x681.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-450x383.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-900x766.jpeg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>When Laurie Gale started looking into debugging research for his PhD, he noticed that the majority of studies had been with college students, so he decided to change that and find out what would make debugging easier for novice programmers at secondary school.</em><br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>When students first start learning how to program, they have to remember a vast amount of new information, such as different variables, concepts, and program designs. Utilising this knowledge is often challenging because they’re already busy juggling all the content they’ve previously learnt and the challenges of the programming task at hand. When error messages inevitably appear that are confusing or misunderstood, it can become extremely difficult to debug effectively.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="156" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-500x156.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88653" style="width:630px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-500x156.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-300x94.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-768x240.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-800x250.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-450x141.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8-900x281.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-8.png 1422w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Program error messages are usually not tailored to the age of the programmers and can be hard to understand and overwhelming for novices.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Given this information overload, students often don’t develop efficient strategies for debugging. When Laurie analysed the debugging efforts of 12- to 14-year-old secondary school students, he noticed some interesting differences between students who were more and less successful at debugging. While successful students generally seemed to make less frequent and more intentional changes, less successful students tinkered frequently with their broken programs, making one- or two-character edits before running the program again. In addition, the less successful students often ran the program soon after beginning the debugging exercise without allowing enough time to actually read the code and understand what it was meant to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The issue with these behaviours was that they often resulted in students <strong>adding errors</strong> when changing the program, which then compounded and made debugging increasingly difficult with each run. 74% of students also resorted to spamming, pressing ‘run’ again and again without changing anything. This strategy resonated with many of our seminar attendees, who reported doing the same thing after becoming frustrated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Educators need to be aware of the negative consequences of students’ exasperating and often overwhelming experiences with debugging, especially if students are less confident in their programming skills to begin with. Even though spending 15 minutes on an exercise shows a remarkable level of tenaciousness and resilience, students’ attitudes to programming — and computing as a whole — can quickly go downhill if their strategies for identifying errors prove ineffective. Debugging becomes a vicious circle: if a student has negative experiences, they are less confident when having to bug-fix again in the future, which can lead to another set of unsuccessful attempts, which can further damage their confidence, and so on. Avoiding this downward spiral is essential.&nbsp;</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Approaches to help students engage with debugging</h1>



<p>Laurie stresses the importance of understanding the cognitive challenges of debugging and using the right tools and techniques to empower students and support them in developing effective strategies.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="282" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-500x282.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88654" style="width:594px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-500x282.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-768x434.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-800x452.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-450x254.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9-900x508.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image-9.png 1071w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>To make debugging a less cognitively demanding activity, Laurie recommends using a range of tools and strategies in the classroom.</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Some ideas of how to improve debugging skills that were mentioned by Laurie and our attendees included:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Using frame-based editing tools for novice programmers</strong> because such tools encourage students to focus on logical errors rather than accidental syntax errors, which can distract them from understanding the issues with the program. Teaching debugging should also go hand in hand with understanding programming syntax and using simple language. As one of our attendees put it, “You wouldn’t give novice readers a huge essay and ask them to find errors.”</li>



<li><strong>Making error messages more understandable</strong>, for example, by <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/error-message-explanations-large-language-models-teachers-views/">explaining them to students using Large Language Models</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Teaching systematic debugging processes</strong>. There are several different approaches to doing this. One of our participants suggested using the scientific method (forming a hypothesis about what is going wrong, devising an experiment that will provide information to see whether the hypothesis is right, and iterating this process) to methodically understand the program and its bugs. </li>
</ul>



<p>Most importantly, debugging should not be a daunting or stressful experience. Everyone in the seminar agreed that creating a positive error culture is essential.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some ideas you could explore in your classroom include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Normalising errors</strong>: Stress how normal and important program errors are. Everyone encounters them — a professional software developer in our audience said that they spend about half of their time debugging. </li>



<li><strong>Rewarding perseverance</strong>: Celebrate the effort, not just the outcome.</li>



<li><strong>Modelling how to fix errors</strong>: Let your students write buggy programs and attempt to debug them in front of the class.</li>
</ul>



<p>In a welcoming classroom where students are given support and encouragement, debugging can be a rewarding experience. What may at first appear to be a failure — even a spectacular one — can be embraced as a valuable opportunity for learning. As a teacher in Laurie’s study said, “If something should have gone right and went badly wrong but somebody found something interesting on the way… you celebrate it. Take the fear out of it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the new academic year fully under way in many parts of the world, it&#8217;s the perfect time to reflect on the growth and innovations we&#8217;ve achieved with <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Ada Computer Science platform</a>. Your feedback has helped us make improvements to better support teachers and students — here&#8217;s a look back at some of the key developments for Ada from the past 12 months.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ada-event-23-500x333.jpg" alt="Teachers in discussion at a table." class="wp-image-87837" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ada-event-23-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ada-event-23-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ada-event-23-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ada-event-23-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ada-event-23-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ada-event-23-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ada-event-23-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ada-event-23-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Teachers in discussion at a Raspberry Pi Foundation teacher training event.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Supporting students through personalised learning, new resources, and new questions</strong></h2>



<p>We made significant improvements throughout the year to support students with exam preparation and personalised learning. We introduced over 145 new self-marking questions and updated 50 existing ones, bringing the total to <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/questions?examBoard=ada&amp;examBoards=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 1000</a>. A new type of question was also launched to help students practise writing longer responses: they label parts of a sample answer and apply a mark scheme, simulating a peer review process. You can read more about this work in the AI section below.</p>



<p>We updated the question finder tool with an intuitive new design. Instead of seeing ten questions at random, students can now see all the questions we have on any given topic, and can use the filters to refine their searches by qualification and difficulty level. This enables students to better personalise their revision and progress tracking</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Ada Computer Science has been very effective for my revision. I like how it provides hints and pointers if you answer a question incorrectly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>– Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/topics/sound_representation?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Representation of sound’</a> topic received a major update, with clearer explanations, new diagrams, and improved feedback to support students as they tackle common misconceptions in sound physics. We also refreshed the <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/topics/number_representation?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Representation of numbers’</a> topic, adding new content and interactive quizzes to support teachers in assessing students&#8217; understanding more effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We introduced a new database scenario titled <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/topics/projdb_repair_and_reform?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Repair &amp; Reform’</a>, offering an entity relationship diagram, a data dictionary, and a new SQL editor and question set to help students prepare for project-based assessments. We&#8217;ve further expanded this scenario into a <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/topics/projdb_repair_and_reform?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full project</a> covering all stages of development, including requirements analysis and evaluation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>April was dedicated to gearing up for the exam season, with the introduction of revision flashcards and ready-made quizzes on key topics like bitmapped graphics and sorting algorithms. We also launched <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/pages/student_challenges?examBoard=all&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a student revision challenge</a>, which ran from April to June and attracted over 600 participants.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Ada Computer Science is an excellent resource to help support teachers and students. The explanations are clear and relevant, and the questions help students test their knowledge and understanding in a structured way, providing links to help them reconcile any discrepancies or misunderstandings.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>– Patrick Kennedy, Computer Science teacher</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Supporting teachers</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We expanded our efforts to support new computer science teachers with the launch of <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/pages/teacher_mentoring_2024?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a teacher mentoring programme</a> that offers free online drop-in sessions. We also hosted a teacher training event at the Raspberry Pi Foundation office in Cambridge (as seen in the picture below), where educators saw previews of upcoming content on AI and machine learning and contributed their own questions to the platform.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13-500x333.jpg" alt="Group photo featuring computer science teachers and colleagues from the Raspberry PI Foundation." class="wp-image-88014" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI content and AI features</strong></h2>



<p>We continued our focus on AI and machine learning, <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/topics?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing new learning resources</a> that explore the ethical and social implications of AI alongside the practical applications of AI and machine learning models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To expand the Ada platform&#8217;s features, we also made considerable progress in integrating a large language model (LLM) to mark free-text responses. Our research showed that, as of June, LLM marks matched real teachers&#8217; marks 82% of the time. In July, we received ethics approval from the University of Cambridge to add LLM-marked questions to the Ada platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Computer science education in Scotland</strong></h2>



<p>We made significant strides towards supporting Scottish teachers and students with <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/exam_specifications_scotland?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all#scotland_national_5/sqa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resources tailored to the SQA Computing Science curriculum</a>. From September to November last year, we piloted a new set of materials specifically designed for Scottish teachers, receiving valuable feedback that we&#8217;ve used in 2024 to develop new content. More than half of the theory content for the National 5 and Higher specifications is now available on the platform.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="332" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-500x332.png" alt="Teacher, in the middle of a computing lesson." class="wp-image-88585" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-500x332.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-300x199.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-768x509.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-800x531.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-450x298.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-900x597.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2.png 1191w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Our ‘Reform &amp; Repair’ database scenario and project align with both SQA Higher and A level standards, providing a comprehensive resource for students preparing for project-based assessments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking ahead: New resources for September and beyond</strong></h2>



<p>We have big plans for Ada for the next 12 months. Our focus will remain on continuously improving our resources and supporting the needs of both educators and students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the positive response to our ‘Repair &amp; Reform’ database project, our content experts are planning additional practical projects to support students and teachers. The next one will be a web project that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, supporting students taking SQA qualifications in Scotland or undertaking the non-examined assessment (NEA) at A level.</p>



<p>We’ll be working on a number of teacher-focused improvements to the platform, which you’ll also see on Ada&#8217;s sibling site, <a href="https://isaacphysics.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Isaac Physics</a>. These will include an overhaul of the markbook to make it more user-friendly, and updates to the ‘Assignments’ tool so assignments better meet the needs of teachers in schools.</p>



<p>We’ll be welcoming the next cohort of computer science students to the STEM SMART programme in January 2025 where, in partnership with the University of Cambridge, we’ll offer free, complementary teaching and support to UK students at state schools. <a href="https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/stem-smart">Applications are now open</a>.</p>



<p>Thank you to every teacher and student who has given their time in the last year to share feedback about <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/">Ada Computer Science</a> — your insights are invaluable as we work to make high-quality computer science materials easily accessible. Here&#8217;s to another fantastic year of learning and growth!</p>

<p>When you walk into a vibrant Code Club, it is easy to see that the young creators are having fun with digital making. But are they actually learning anything? Our recent evaluation has shown that not only are they developing their coding skills, but there are many other benefits.</p>

<p><a href="https://codeclub.org">Code Club</a> is a network of free coding clubs where young people learn how to create with technology. The Raspberry Pi Foundation supports Code Clubs through training and guidance for mentors, and by providing learning resources that lead to meaningful and lasting learning outcomes for the young people attending the clubs.</p>



<p>Founded in the UK in 2012, Code Club has grown into a global movement and has already inspired more than 2 million young people to learn how to build their own apps, games, animations, websites, and so much more. We are incredibly proud of the impact Code Club has already achieved and we want many more young people to benefit. Our ambitious goal for the next decade is to reach 10 million more young people through Code Club.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New impact insights about Code Club</strong></h2>



<p>We&#8217;re ambitious about Code Club because we know it works. Over the last year, the <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/evidence-centre-education/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Durham University Evidence Centre for Education (DECE)</a> conducted an independent evaluation of the programme that confirmed <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/03/Randomised-Controlled-Trial-and-Process-Evaluation-of-Code-Clubs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier evidence</a>: attending Code Club leads to positive outcomes for young people.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-500x333.jpg" alt="Two young people smiling whilst working on their laptop with an adult mentor by their side." class="wp-image-88616" style="width:500px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>The DECE evaluation showed that young people who attend Code Club build their coding skills. They also become more confident in learning coding, grow their interest in it, and develop a sense of belonging. Researchers observed how each young person has their individual projects to work on, which promote a sense of ownership and personalised learning, but that there are also opportunities for collaboration and celebrating their achievements with other creators in the club.</p>



<p>Young people also develop positive attitudes to coding and a range of life skills such as problem solving and communication. These skills and mindsets prepare young people to confidently engage with emerging technologies and with learning in a broader context.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“Coding is really fun when I know what to do, but sometimes it is hard. But I always keep trying.”</em> </p>



<p>– Code Club creator.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another finding was that Code Clubs are a place where young people who experience difficulties in formal classroom settings can thrive. This suggests Code Clubs can help educators engage a more diverse group of young people in creating with technology than formal education alone could.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“We see pupils in completely different roles when they are doing these Code Club activities. They enjoy more, and you can see they have skills to do things that we otherwise don’t notice.”</em> </p>



<p>– Code Club mentor.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>None of the benefits for young people would be possible without the volunteers who give their time and make Code Clubs the positive learning environments they are. Their support is crucial to young people’s engagement and skill development. The evaluation showed that mentors find the experience of volunteering rewarding, and pointed us towards areas where we can offer further support to help them run engaging, impactful Code Clubs.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“…volunteering with Code Club has helped me feel I’m a useful member of society in my old age, so the benefits have been good for me too.”</em></p>



<p> – Code Club mentor.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How we&#8217;re building on our support for clubs</strong></h2>



<p>With AI already transforming so many parts of our lives, learning how to create with technology has never been more important. Generative AI is changing how humans give instructions to computers, and at Code Club, young people can experiment with new technologies such as AI in a safe environment. New projects that support young people to learn about AI technologies will be added to the <a href="https://codeclub.org/en/learn-to-code">Code Club Projects site</a> later this month, alongside support for club leaders and mentors on this topic.</p>



<p>The evaluation methods used by the DECE will help us hone our ongoing impact measurement work for Code Clubs running in communities all over the world. As we continue to support Code Clubs, we are taking into account that the independent evaluation ran in school-based Code Clubs in the UK only. In our work to grow the Code Club network across the globe, we are adapting our support and resources for local contexts in collaboration with partners who share their expertise.</p>



<p>This will ensure that Code Clubs can provide a fun, welcoming space for all young people. And while they’re having fun, they will also gain relevant learning experiences that empower them to engage confidently with a world that is being transformed by digital technologies.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the DECE evaluation&#8217;s results, we&#8217;ve put together a <a href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/about/Code_Club_Summary_Report_Durham-Oct_2024.pdf">summary</a> for you to download.</p>

<p>Since we <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/code-editor-beta-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first launched the Code Editor</a>, a free online tool designed to support young people&nbsp;as they learn text-based programming, we’ve been excited to hear how educators have been trying it out in their classrooms.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I used the Code Editor with my computer science students yesterday and it worked a dream! Students were able to write and run code without any issues.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Head of Computer Science</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Code Editor is designed for learning, rather than for professional use, and is informed by our understanding of pedagogy and computing education. It can be accessed from a web browser without installing any additional software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we announced that we’d be <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/code-editor-classroom-management/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introducing classroom management features</a> and we’re now pleased to confirm that we’ve launched the beta version of <a href="https://editor.raspberrypi.org/en/education" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Editor for Education</a> with school accounts.<strong> </strong>You can be the first to try out the new features, together with the many schools who have chosen to pre-register their school accounts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Simple and easy classroom management</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve kept the educator interface clean, simple, and easy to use. School owners can invite other teachers to join, add students, organise students into classes, and help students reset their passwords quickly. Educators can create coding projects to share with students and view their work.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>All features, totally free</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve added these classroom management features because one of the key problems we’ve seen educators face over the past months has been the lack of an affordable tool to teach text-based coding in the classroom. We will always provide the Code Editor and all of its features to educators and students for free.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Safe and private by design</strong></h2>



<p>We take safeguarding seriously, providing visibility of student work at all times, as well as features such as the ability to report a concern. In line with best practices protecting children online, we minimise data capture so that we have just enough to keep students safe.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Future developments&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>As the platform is currently in beta, we’d love to hear what you think of the new classroom management features — please <a href="https://form.raspberrypi.org/f/code-editor-for-education-feedback">send us your feedback</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ll be actively looking to develop new features over the coming months. Such features are set to include an extended set of Python libraries,<strong> </strong>custom instructions that sit alongside starter code projects and teacher-to-student feedback capabilities. All new developments will be informed by ongoing educator feedback.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Coolest Projects in 2024</h2>



<p>This year, 7197 young people across 4678 projects took part in our global Coolest Projects online showcase, with participants from 43 countries. All of these projects were shared in our <a href="https://online.coolestprojects.org/events/cp-2024/gallery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online showcase gallery</a>, and we hosted a <a href="https://youtu.be/1ln4S0jYaok" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-streamed event</a> celebrating <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/coolest-projects-2024-young-tech-creators-showcase-their-projects-online/">the judges’ favourites</a> watched by over 1000 people.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-500x333.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-88548" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>At the 2024 in-person Coolest Projects events in Ireland and the UK, 171 young people shared projects. At these events, the young creators presented their projects to other attendees and our team of judges. They also took part in other activities, including a digital escape room.</p>



<p>We wanted to understand how Coolest Projects impacts young people, and so we collected the following data:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For the online showcase, mentors and tech creators filled in a survey when they completed their project registration, and we ran focus groups with mentors, who are adults that support the tech creators</li>



<li>At the UK and Ireland in-person events, creators completed a survey, other event attendees completed feedback cards, and we also interviewed creators.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Online showcase: Impact on skills and confidence</h2>



<p>In the survey, mentors and young people told us that taking part in the Coolest Projects online showcase had a positive impact:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>91% of young people and 87% of mentors agreed or strongly agreed that taking part in Coolest Projects online inspired them or their team to continue to participate in computing and technology</li>



<li>89% of young people and 86% of mentors agreed or strongly agreed that taking part in Coolest Projects online increased their or their team&#8217;s confidence in coding and digital making</li>
</ul>



<p>Mentors told us that the community built by the online showcase gallery played an important role in making young people want to participate,&nbsp; and improving their confidence. One mentor said that “[being part of the online showcase] motivates them actually to do something innovative and&#8230; [the] global community motivates them to think out of the box.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-500x281.png" alt="The favourites in the web category for Coolest Projects 2024." class="wp-image-87659" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-900x506.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>They also reported that the online community inspired young people to solve real-world problems. One mentor said, “the wonderful thing is the kids create so many things which are solutions to world problems.” Others told us that young people feel a great deal of pride that their solutions are available for others to see online and that they get ideas from other projects on how to solve problems. One mentor from India told us about a young person who created a boat to clean rivers and then was inspired to learn to program micro:bit devices, having seen similar projects in the gallery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Focus on ‘growth, not competition’</h2>



<p>The phrase ‘growth, not competition’ came from the mentors in the focus group, and we love this description.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“[With] Coolest Projects… the only agenda is to grow. Grow with the coding, nurture your skills, creativity.” – Focus group attendee.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the focus group, mentors told us they really valued the way the Coolest Projects online showcase allows all young people to participate, including those who were less experienced tech creators. One mentor told us that because everyone’s project is displayed in the gallery the <em>“</em>beauty is that everybody is encouraged individually… regarding the experience. … They can start with very small things. And they have [the] opportunity to upload it on the platform.”</p>



<p>One mentor who supports young people in remote locations in India spoke about the way Coolest Projects offers a level playing field where his students can be included and participate to the same extent as less remote places: “students never feel left behind.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="551" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-500x551.jpg" alt="Three young people working together on a tech project." class="wp-image-82384" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-500x551.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-227x250.jpg 227w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-768x846.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-800x881.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-450x496.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-900x991.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010.jpg 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>The in-person events also reflected the diversity of young people’s experience of digital making. Of those creators who answered surveys, 35% said it was their first time making this kind of project, while 37% said they had made similar projects before. This mix of experience was also reflected in the interviews, with some young people creating something for the first time and having only started learning coding recently, while others had been developing their projects for a long time. Many creators told us they felt inspired by the opportunity to show their projects to others, regardless of their experience level.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In-person events: Building a community of digital creators</h2>



<p>Attendees at both Coolest Projects UK and Ireland commented on the sense of community and the excitement that was generated by being around other young people. One young person spoke about how much they enjoyed being “surrounded by people who like coding too”. They really valued seeing other creators’ projects and speaking with their peers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-500x333.jpg" alt="The exhibition hall at Coolest Projects Ireland 2023." class="wp-image-84885" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>The young people we spoke to reflected on the positive impact of this sense of community and belonging. They told us that seeing others’ projects inspired them to develop their ideas and learn new skills. One young person described how the in-person event allowed them to <em>“</em>get inspired and socialise.” A second said, “that’s why I’m here — to get inspired.”</p>



<p>Another clear theme was how much young people valued the opportunity to show their projects to others. This gave them confidence in their own ability to build things. One creator at Coolest Projects UK spoke about the sense of achievement they felt after building something themselves and then being able to present it to others.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="355" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-500x355.jpg" alt="Two young people share a project on their laptop with a judge at Coolest Projects." class="wp-image-88545" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-500x355.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-300x213.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-768x545.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-1536x1090.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-800x567.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-450x319.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-900x638.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10.jpg 1906w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Young people at both events spoke about their plans for what they wanted to do next, talking about trying new technology such as building games, learning Python, and creating mobile apps. At both events, creators described how they wanted to continue to develop and build on their existing ideas with the possibility of showcasing them again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we want to learn next</h2>



<p>We are continuing to look for ways to improve the Coolest Projects experience for young people and their mentors. As part of this, we are conducting user experience research to understand how we can improve the registration process for the online Coolest Projects showcase.</p>



<p>We were delighted to hear from mentors in this year’s focus group how much they valued the online showcase gallery, and we want to understand the impact of this resource better as part of Coolest Projects 2025. If you want to find out more about Coolest Projects, we highly recommend taking a look at <a href="https://online.coolestprojects.org/events/cp-2024/gallery">the amazing projects made by young people around the world</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dates for Coolest Projects 2025</h2>



<p>We’re so pleased that so many young people around the world loved taking part in Coolest Projects this year. And we’re very excited that Coolest Projects will be back and bigger than ever before in 2025!&nbsp;</p>

Read the stories of 3 educators who share their thoughts on the curriculum’s application, adaptability, and the impact it’s had on their educational settings. </p>



<p><strong>I’m Freda, and I co-founded a non-profit organisation called Waloyo in South Africa.</strong></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" class="wp-image-88479" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Freda_TCC-500x333.png" alt="Photo of Freda, co-founder of the non-profit organisation called Waloyo." srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Freda_TCC-500x333.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Freda_TCC-300x200.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Freda_TCC-768x512.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Freda_TCC-800x533.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Freda_TCC-450x300.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Freda_TCC.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Coming from a background of technology consulting, I know the value of computing education. I have a real drive to teach young kids coding so they can get ahead and find jobs in our digital economy.</p>



<p>Our role at Waloyo is to work with non-profit organisations that work with young people and want to expand their services to include computing skills training. Waloyo trains non-profit facilitators, who in turn teach computing skills to youth between the ages of 6 and 18. A unique challenge is that the majority of facilitators we train don&#8217;t have any previous computing experience. The resources we use need to be clear and easy to follow.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>What I really love about The Computing Curriculum resources is the facilitator guides.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Our initial plan was to run the training programmes after school and outside the school curriculum, but we were getting requests from schools to support them too. South Africa doesn’t have a national computing curriculum, so there aren’t many subject specialist teachers. So we looked for curriculum resources from other countries to support our work and that’s how we found The Computing Curriculum.<strong> </strong></p>



<p>In rural Africa where we work, students have low levels of exposure to computers and computing. So whether they are 6 or 18 years old, we usually start with Scratch. The younger kids then continue with Scratch and the older kids move quickly on to Python as they build confidence.</p>

<p>What I really love about The Computing Curriculum resources is the facilitator guides. They fit in well with our process of training NGO facilitators to work directly with the kids. I love the comprehensiveness and flexibility of what your curriculum provides to enable this method of delivery.</p>



<p>So far we&#8217;ve launched 3 programmes in communities in South Africa, impacting around 150 young people, and it’s worked beautifully. It&#8217;s phenomenal to see how excited the kids get when the computer does what they want it to do!</p>

<p>For the past 13 years, I’ve taught in international schools. Two years ago, I decided to retrain in teaching computing. My wife and I are currently teaching in Kazakhstan. I now teach at primary level but still handle some secondary classes. For primary, there&#8217;s significant time pressure, especially with extra lessons for the local language, making it challenging to fit computing into the schedule.</p>



<p>The private schools where I work are starting to implement the UK computer science curriculum. At one of the schools, they have a robotics course which has given rise to a misconception that everything in computing is about robotics! My role, therefore, involves expanding the concept of robotics to include a broader range of computing activities and finding efficient ways to integrate these new materials into the curriculum with minimal effort from the staff. I focus on selecting appropriate units to fit into what the schools are already doing rather than implementing a comprehensive new program.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation’s curriculum resources are valuable because they provide comprehensive lists of programs and ideas that I can adapt for my colleagues. I adapt resources to make them more accessible for primary teachers, simplifying and customising them for ease of use.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Once students understand that computing is a tool for developing skills rather than just passive consumption, they take ownership of their learning which boosts their confidence. Culturally relevant materials are particularly effective, especially in diverse international classrooms. Adapting resources to be culturally relevant and incorporating students&#8217; examples enhances their usefulness and impact. The resources are excellent, but by tailoring them, they can be even more effective, particularly in an international context with diverse nationalities and learning concepts.</p>

<p>As Head of Department, I am responsible for what all the different age groups learn, from year 1 to year 12. We use the Cambridge International (CIE) curriculum, so I was looking for supplementary resources that build from the basics, have a clear progression map, and complement the resources we already had.</p>



<p>With The Computing Curriculum, it is easy to pick out individual lesson resources to use. I love that it doesn’t need a licence and that the students don’t face any problems when they download it to practise at home. I’m covering curriculums for both computing and digital literacy, so I use resources that are relevant to my curriculum maps.</p>

<p>In some schools, their idea of an ICT lesson is getting students to play games, use Word documents, make PowerPoint presentations, and that’s it. But this generation of students love coding and making their own games. So instead of playing the game, we teach them how to develop a game and how to add the characters themselves.</p>



<p>From year 1 to year 2, students take part in a wide range of computing activities and develop a lot of new skills. They find these skills amazing. It makes them feel engaged, excited, and that they are doing something valuable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using The Computing Curriculum </h2>



<p>These educators’ stories show how easy it is to adapt our Computing Curriculum to your unique context, enhancing students&#8217; technical skills and inspiring creativity, critical thinking, and a passion for problem-solving. We look forward to continuing this journey with these and other educators as they transform computing education for their learners.</p>

<p>Today we&#8217;re unveiling a fresh look and feel for Code Club, along with a new ambition to inspire 10 million more young people to get creative with technology over the next decade.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="358" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-500x358.png" alt="Three young tech creators at laptops at a Code Club session." class="wp-image-88516" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-500x358.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-300x215.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-768x550.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-800x573.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-450x322.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-900x644.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img.png 1133w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Code Club is a network of free coding clubs where young people learn how to create with technology. Founded in the UK in 2012, it has grown to be a global movement that has already inspired more than 2 million young people to learn how to build their own apps, games, animations, websites, and so much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know that Code Club works. Independent evaluations have demonstrated that attending a Code Club helps young people develop their programming skills as well as wider life skills like confidence, resilience, and skills in problem-solving and communication. This impact is a result of the positive learning environment created by the teachers and volunteers that run Code Clubs, with young people enjoying the activities and developing skills independently and collaboratively — including young people who sometimes struggle in a formal classroom setting.</p>



<p>Just as important, we know that Code Clubs inspire young people from all backgrounds, including girls and young people from communities that are underrepresented in the technology sector.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s changing and why&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While we are incredibly proud of the impact that Code Club has already achieved, we want to see many more young people benefiting, and that led us to set the ambitious goal to reach 10 million more young people over the next decade.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="400" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-800x400.png" alt="Two mentors and a young tech creator at a laptop at a Code Club session." class="wp-image-88496" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-800x400.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-300x150.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-500x250.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-768x384.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-1536x768.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-450x225.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-900x450.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01.png 1750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<p>To help us figure out how to reach that ambition, we spent a lot of time this year listening to the community as well as engaging with parents, teachers, and young people who aren&#8217;t yet involved in Code Club. All of the changes we&#8217;ve made have been informed by those conversations and are designed to make it easier for educators and volunteers all over the world to set up and run Code Clubs.</p>



<p>The biggest change is that we are making Code Club a more flexible model that can be adapted to reflect your local context and culture to ensure that it is as meaningful as possible for the young people in your community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That means you can host a Code Club in a school or a community venue, like a library or makerspace; you can choose the age range and rhythm of meetings that make sense for your setting; and you can tailor the activities that you offer to the interests and skills of the young people you are serving. In order for the movement to be as inclusive as possible, you don&#8217;t even need to be called &#8216;Code Club&#8217; to be an &#8216;Official Raspberry Pi Foundation Code Club&#8217; and benefit from all the support we offer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To support this change, we have developed a <a href="http://rpf.io/cc-charter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Club Charter</a> that we ask all club leaders and mentors to sign up to. This sets out the principles that are shared by all Code Clubs, along with the commitments that the Raspberry Pi Foundation is making about our support to you.</p>



<p>We have launched a <a href="https://codeclub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new website</a> that makes it easier for you to find the information you need to set up and run your Code Club, along with an updated and simplified <a href="http://rpf.io/leaderguide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">club leader guide</a>. In a few weeks time, we are launching a new online course with guidance on how to run a successful club, and we will be adding to our programme of online community calls, webinars, and training to support a growing community of club leaders and mentors.</p>

<p>One of the most important parts of our support for Code Clubs is the <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">projects</a> that help young people learn how to bring their ideas to life using a wide range of hardware and software. As they are created by experienced educators, based on research, rigorously tested, and translated into dozens of languages, you can have confidence that these projects lead to meaningful and lasting learning outcomes for the young people attending your club. Code Club projects enable young people to learn independently, meaning that mentors don&#8217;t need technical skills.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What this means for CoderDojos&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Alongside Code Club, the Foundation supports CoderDojo, a network of coding clubs that started life in Cork, Ireland in 2011 and merged with the Raspberry Pi Foundation in 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to reduce duplication and make it easier for anyone to set up and run a coding club, we have decided to bring together the resources and support for all club leaders and mentors under one website, which is the new Code Club website.</p>



<p>There is no need for existing CoderDojos to change their name or anything about the way they operate. All registered CoderDojos will be able to manage their club in exactly the same way through the new website, and to access all of the support and resources that we offer to all coding clubs. New clubs will be able to register as CoderDojos.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="569" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-800x569.png" alt="Two young tech creators at a tablet at a Code Club session." class="wp-image-88490" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-800x569.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-300x213.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-500x356.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-768x546.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-450x320.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-900x640.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys.png 1133w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<p>The ethos, experiences, and lessons from the CoderDojo community have been a vital part of the development of the new Code Club. We have worked hard to make sure that all existing CoderDojos feel that their values are reflected in the Charter, and that the guidance and resources we offer address their circumstances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CoderDojos will very much remain part of this community, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation will continue to celebrate and learn from the amazing work of CoderDojos all over the world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Code Club in the age of artificial intelligence&nbsp;</h2>



<p>With AI already transforming so many parts of our lives, it&#8217;s not surprising that some people are starting to ask whether young people even need to learn to code anymore.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="569" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-800x569.png" alt="Three young tech creators at laptops at a Code Club session." class="wp-image-88491" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-800x569.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-300x213.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-500x356.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-768x546.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-450x320.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-900x640.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration.png 1133w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<p>We&#8217;ve got a lot to say on this subject — so watch this space — but the short version is that learning how to create with technology has never been more important. The way that humans give instructions to computers is changing, and Code Club provides a way for young people to experiment with new technologies like AI in a safe environment. Over the next couple of weeks, we&#8217;ll be launching new Code Club projects that support young people to learn about AI technologies, including generative AI, and we&#8217;ll be providing support for club leaders and mentors on the topic too.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thank you and get involved</h2>



<p>I want to end by saying a huge thank you to everyone who has been part of the Code Club journey so far, and particularly to everyone who has worked so hard on this project over the past year — far too many people to name here, but you know who you are. I also want to thank all of the parents, teachers, mentors, and partners who have provided the feedback and ideas that have shaped these changes.</p>

<p>Code Club and CoderDojo were both founded in the early 2010s by individuals who wanted to give more young people the opportunity to be digital creators, not just consumers. From that first Dojo in Cork, Ireland, and the first Code Clubs in London, UK, we&#8217;ve built a global movement that has empowered millions of young people to engage confidently with a world that is being transformed by digital technologies.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s never been a better time to get involved with Code Club, so please take a look and <a href="https://codeclub.org/en/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get in touch</a> if you need any <a href="https://codeclub.org/en/help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help or support</a> to get started.</p>

<p>Since they became publicly available at the end of 2022, generative AI tools have been hotly discussed by educators: what role should these tools for generating human-seeming text, images, and other media play in teaching and learning?</p>



<p>Two years later, the one thing most people agree on is that, like it or not, generative AI is here to stay. And as a computing educator, you probably have your learners and colleagues looking to you for guidance about this technology. We’re sharing how educators like you are approaching generative AI in issue 25 of Hello World, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org//hello-world/issues/25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out today for free</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="262" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-500x262.png" alt="Digital image of a copy of Hello World magazine, issue 25." class="wp-image-88433" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-500x262.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-300x157.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-768x402.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-800x419.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-450x236.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-900x471.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Generative AI and teaching</h2>



<p>Since our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/hello-world-22-ai-education/">‘Teaching and AI’ issue</a> a year ago, educators have been making strides grappling with generative AI’s place in their classroom, and with the potential risks to young people. In this issue, you’ll hear from a wide range of educators who are approaching this technology in different ways. </p>



<p>For example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Laura Ventura from Gwinnett County Public Schools (GCPS) in Georgia, USA shares how the GCPS team has integrated AI throughout their K–12 curriculum</li>



<li>Mark Calleja from our team guides you through using the OCEAN prompt process to reliably get the results you want from an LLM&nbsp;</li>



<li>Kip Glazer, principal at Mountain View High School in California, USA shares a framework for AI implementation aimed at school leaders</li>



<li>Stefan Seegerer, a researcher and educator in Germany, discusses why unplugged activities help us focus on what’s really important in teaching about AI</li>
</ul>



<p>This issue also includes practical solutions to problems that are unique to computer science educators:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Graham Hastings in the UK shares his solution to tricky crocodile clips when working with micro:bits</li>



<li>Riyad Dhuny shares his case study of home-hosting a learning management system with his students in Mauritius</li>
</ul>



<p>And there is lots more for you to discover in issue 25.</p>

</div>



<p>Whether or not you use generative AI as part of your teaching practice, it’s important for you to be aware of AI technologies and how your young people may be interacting with it. In his article <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-were-taking-a-problem-first-approach-to-the-development-of-ai-systems/">“A problem-first approach to the development of AI systems”</a>, Ben Garside from our team affirms that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“A big part of our job as educators is to help young people navigate the changing world and prepare them for their futures, and education has an essential role to play in helping people understand AI technologies so that they can avoid the dangers.</p>



<p>Our approach at the Raspberry Pi Foundation is not to focus purely on the threats and dangers, but to teach young people to be critical users of technologies and not passive consumers. [&#8230;]</p>



<p>Our call to action to educators, carers, and parents is to have conversations with your young people about generative AI. Get to know their opinions on it and how they view its role in their lives, and help them to become critical thinkers when interacting with technology.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Share your thoughts &amp; subscribe to Hello World</h2>



<p>Computing teachers are being asked again to teach something that they didn’t study. With generative AI as with all things computing, we want to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/teach/">support your teaching</a> and share your successes.

<p>To empower every educator to confidently bring AI into their classroom, we&#8217;ve created a new online training course called <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/education-teacher-training/raspberry-pi-foundation-teach-teens-computing-understanding-ai-for-teachers?utm_source=rpf-blog&amp;utm_medium=partner-marketing&amp;utm_campaign=raspberrypifoundation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Understanding AI for educators’</a> in collaboration with Google DeepMind. By taking this course, you will gain a practical understanding of the crossover between AI tools and education. The course includes a conceptual look at what AI is, how AI systems are built, different approaches to problem-solving with AI, and how to use current AI tools effectively and ethically.</p>

<p>In this post, I will share our approach to designing the course and some of the key considerations behind it — all of which you can apply today to teach your learners about AI systems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Design decisions: Nurturing knowledge and confidence</h2>



<p>We know educators have different levels of confidence with AI tools — we designed this course to help create a level playing field. Our goal is to uplift every educator, regardless of their prior experience, to a point where they feel comfortable discussing AI in the classroom.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-500x333.jpg" alt="Three computer science educators discuss something at a screen." class="wp-image-79983" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>AI literacy is key to understanding the implications and opportunities of AI in education. The course provides educators with a solid conceptual foundation, enabling them to ask the right questions and form their own perspectives.</p>



<p>As with all our AI learning materials that are part of <a href="https://experience-ai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI</a>, we’ve used specific design principles for the course:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Choosing language carefully:</strong> We <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-anthropomorphism/">never anthropomorphise AI systems</a>, replacing phrases like “The model understands” with “The model analyses”. We do this to make it clear that AI is just a computer system, not a sentient being with thoughts or feelings.</li>



<li><strong>Accurate terminology</strong>: We avoid using AI as a singular noun, opting instead for the more accurate ‘AI tool’ when talking about applications or ‘AI system’ when talking about underlying component parts.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Ethics:</strong> The social and ethical impacts of AI are not an afterthought but highlighted throughout the learning materials.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Three main takeaways</h2>



<p>The course offers three main takeaways any educator can apply to their teaching about AI systems.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Communicating effectively about AI systems</strong></h3>



<p>Deciding the level of detail to use when talking about AI systems can be difficult — especially if you&#8217;re not very confident about the topic. The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/">SEAME framework</a> offers a solution by breaking down AI into 4 levels: social and ethical, application, model, and engine. Educators can focus on the level most relevant to their lessons and also use the framework as a useful structure for classroom discussions.</p>

<p>You might discuss the impact a particular AI system is having on society, without the need to explain to your learners how the model itself has been trained or tested. Equally, you might focus on a specific machine learning model to look at where the data used to create it came from and consider the effect the data source has on the output.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Problem-solving approaches: Predictive vs. generative AI</h3>



<p>AI applications can be broadly separated into two categories: predictive and generative. These two types of AI model represent two vastly different approaches to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-were-taking-a-problem-first-approach-to-the-development-of-ai-systems/">problem-solving</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People create <strong>predictive AI models</strong> to make predictions about the future. For example, you might create a model to make weather forecasts based on previously recorded weather data, or to recommend new movies to you based on your previous viewing history. In developing predictive AI models, the problem is defined first — then a specific dataset is assembled to help solve it. Therefore, each predictive AI model usually is only useful for a small number of applications.</p>

<p><strong>Generative AI models</strong> are used to generate media (such as text, code, images, or audio). The possible applications of these models are much more varied because people can use media in many different kinds of ways. You might say that the outputs of generative AI models could be used to solve — or at least to partially solve — any number of problems, without these problems needing to be defined before the model is created.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3.&nbsp;Using generative AI tools: The OCEAN process</h3>



<p>Generative AI systems rely on user prompts to generate outputs. The OCEAN process, outlined in the course, offers a simple yet powerful framework for prompting AI tools like Gemini, Stable Diffusion or ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The first three steps of the process help you write better prompts that will result in an output that is as close as possible to what you are looking for, while the last two steps outline how to improve the output:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Clearly state what you want the model to generate</li>



<li><strong>Context</strong>: Provide necessary background information</li>



<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Offer specific examples to fine-tune the model’s output</li>



<li><strong>Assess</strong>: Evaluate the output&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Negotiate</strong>: Refine the prompt to correct any errors in the output</li>
</ol>



<p>The final step in using any generative AI tool should be to closely review or edit the output yourself. These tools will very quickly get you started but you&#8217;ll always have to rely on your own human effort to ensure the quality of your work.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Helping educators to be critical users</h2>



<p>We believe the knowledge and skills our ‘Understanding AI for educators’ course teaches will help any educator determine the right AI tools and concepts to bring into their classroom, regardless of their specialisation. Here&#8217;s what one course participant had to say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;From my inexperienced viewpoint, I kind of viewed AI as a cheat code. I believed that AI in the classroom could possibly be a real detriment to students and eliminate critical thinking skills.<br><br>After learning more about AI [on the course] and getting some hands-on experience with it, my viewpoint has certainly taken a 180-degree turn. AI definitely belongs in schools and in the workplace. It will take time to properly integrate it and know how to ethically use it. Our role as educators is to stay ahead of this trend as opposed to denying AI&#8217;s benefits and falling behind.&#8221; – ‘Understanding AI for educators’ course participant</p>
