<p>Today, we are marking the 10th anniversary of the European Astro Pi Challenge.</p>



<p>At 11:03 on 15 December 2015, former ESA Astronaut Tim Peake launched from Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on a Soyuz rocket as part of his UK Space agency ‘Principia’ mission to the International Space Station (ISS). Two Raspberry Pi-powered Astro Pi Mark 1 computers were waiting for him in the Columbus module of the ISS, ready to be set up for an experimental education activity called “Astro Pi”.</p>

<p>The European Astro Pi Challenge, an ESA Education project run in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and supported by national ESEROs, has been running every year since. The challenge now features two Python coding ‘missions’ that offer young people the amazing opportunity to write a short computer program to send to run on the ISS: Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab.</p>



<p>Tens of thousands of young people participate in Astro Pi annually, reaching over 160,000 participants since 2015. On 15 December this year, Tim Peake and some of the Astro Pi team were at the Science Museum London running Mission Zero workshops for visiting school groups to create their own pixel art programs to send into space.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Setting up the Astro Pi computers on the ISS for those first experiments in 2015 was just the beginning of something truly incredible — it’s amazing to see how much impact the programme has had since then! I hope Astro Pi inspires thousands more young people to code, learn about space technology, and feel empowered to reach for the stars in their own careers.&#8221; – Tim Peake, former ESA Astronaut</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Astro Pi 2015–2025: A space odyssey</h2>



<p>As the challenge has matured, its reach has increased, with over 25,000 participants every year since 2021. Young people from all 27 ESA member and associate states have sent their code into space, with 25% of mentors returning to the challenge year after year.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I think Mission Zero is a way of connecting not only to a worldwide group of learners, but also to explorers, future scientists, and future astronauts. To see them as part of a larger community and not just an activity or assignment that they have to do in class. They discover their own abilities and potential, and exercise their creativity in a very low-stakes environment and then to see it come to life in that global way is extremely valuable.” – Mission Zero mentor&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mission Zero has proved to be a great way to engage girls in computing and tech, with an average of 44% of participants identifying as female. This is well above the national averages for other STEM subjects in many countries.</p>



<p>What attracts many teams of young people to Mission Space Lab is the chance to capture data and images from the SenseHats and High Quality Cameras on the Astro Pi computers. This year the Astro Pis will be positioned in the World Observation Research Facility (WORF) window, which means teams can hope for some fantastic, high-quality Earth-observation images with a full field of view. Each team that achieves Flight Status will receive the images and data their program captures.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The next generation of space explorers</h2>



<p>Astro Pi is one of the most inspirational coding activities that young people can do and gives the exciting chance to reach beyond the boundaries of what they may have thought possible. In the 2024–25 impact report, mentors reported that the young people participating were highly motivated by the possibility of having their code run on the ISS.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Honestly, the idea that a kid can send their own code to space is just mind-blowing. It really makes you rethink what ‘possible’ even means.&#8221; – Jeanna, Astro Pi enthusiast</p>

<p>Participation increases skills, confidence and motivation for further exploration in coding, digital making and STEM subjects.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>83% of Mission Zero mentors agreed that young people increased their skills and confidence in computing and digital making due to their participation</li>



<li>91% of mentors told us that young people who successfully wrote code for Mission Space Lab were likely, or very likely, to participate in computing and digital making challenges in the future</li>
</ul>

<p>We are <a href="http://computingeducationresearch.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a research centre based in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge</a>, with a team that spans the university and the Raspberry Pi Foundation. We conduct research into many aspects of the teaching and learning of computing and AI and we work closely with schools, teachers and young people to ensure our research is applicable to practice.</p>



<p>Below I highlight some of the projects we&#8217;ve worked on in the academic year 2024-2025:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Computing Around the World</li>



<li>AI education</li>



<li>Programming education</li>



<li>Physical computing (EPICS project)</li>



<li>Teacher action research (TICE project)</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Computing Around the World</h2>



<p>As I&#8217;ve written on this blog before, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/brookings-report-global-computer-science-education-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">computing education is a global challenge</a>. In one of the Research Centre&#8217;s projects, we are looking at <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/projects/computer-science-education-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how computing education is spreading around the world</a>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1180" height="618" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1.png" alt="Computing education in countries around the world" class="wp-image-92069" style="width:766px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1.png 1180w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-300x157.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-500x262.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-768x402.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-800x419.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-450x236.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-900x471.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1180px) 100vw, 1180px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Computing education in countries around the world.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>We found that between 2019 and 2024 the number of countries offering computing education had doubled, and that two thirds of all countries now offer, or have concrete plans to offer, computing education. This research has already been highlighted in the <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stanford AI Index</a>, and we are considering repeating the analysis in future years in order to have the most accurate and up-to-date information displayed in our map.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI education</h2>



<p>We have a number of projects in the area of AI education.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Teaching about AI</h3>



<p>We are very interested in how to teach about AI, and held <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/teaching-about-ai-teacher-symposium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a workshop with teachers who were interested in the teaching of AI in February</a>. Following on from the workshop results, we are interviewing more stakeholders, including UK-based experts, teachers and students, about their perspectives on concepts and skills that should be taught as part of an AI curriculum.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1999" height="1333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5.jpg" alt="Notes at our teacher workshop about AI" class="wp-image-92072" style="width:735px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5.jpg 1999w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Notes at our workshop about AI education.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>We&#8217;re also researching data science and data ethics education, which are foundational aspects of AI literacy. Most of the current AI systems are data-driven, having been trained on vast amounts of data. Therefore students need to understand about data and data science if they are to learn about AI systems. Therefore we&#8217;ve conducted two detailed literature reviews <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/projects/data-science-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on data science</a> and <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/projects/data-ethics-education/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on data ethics</a> this year. The first of these will be published in March at <a href="https://www.wipsce.org/2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the WiPSCE </a><a href="http://conference.in">conference</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Unplugged AI in Ghana</h3>



<p>One of our PhD students, <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/saa92" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salomey Addo</a>, has been examining how AI is taught in Ghana, where it is part of the curriculum for young people between ages 12 and 15. This year Salomey published a paper reporting that <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3736181.3747124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghanaian teachers have positive attitudes towards teaching AI but feel unprepared</a> for it. She’s also developed <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CompED-poster.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unplugged resources to teach about artificial neural networks (ANNs)</a>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1080" height="810" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1.jpg" alt="PhD student Salomey explaining how the unplugged resources worked in a teacher PD session in Ghana" class="wp-image-92075" style="width:703px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1.jpg 1080w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">PhD student Salomey explaining how the unplugged resources worked in a teacher PD session in Ghana.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>ANNs are a fundamental technology used in a variety of AI systems, including image recognition and language translation systems. While ANNs are included in the Ghanaian AI curriculum, Salomey observed that teachers had difficulty with this particular topic The resources she developed are directly inspired by this, and involved teaching <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CompED-poster.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through role play and a board game</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Using AI in learning and teaching computing</h3>



<p>This is an area we’ve also done some research in in the past year.</p>



<p>Carrie Anne Philbin <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3754508.3754513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a paper in September</a> showing that — at least in higher education — much of the use of generative AI in computing education is just duplicating the way teachers might already teach, and is primarily passive from a students’ perspective.</p>



<p>Meanwhile Katharine Childs and Veronica Cucuiat have been looking at <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/projects/teaching-programming-with-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how large language models (LLMs) can support secondary school programming education</a> by helping students understand programming error messages.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Programming education: Learning to debug</h2>



<p>Text-based programming is a topic featured in many computing curricula around the world. Teachers and researchers know that younger learners, for example at the lower secondary school level, can find debugging text-based programs very challenging. Although we’ve seen decades of research around programming and debugging focusing on learners who are in higher education, very little research has been done with school-age students.</p>

<p>In his research, <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/lpg28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laurie Gale</a>, a final-year PhD student at the Research Centre, found that learners were impatient to fix programs by trial and error, without figuring out what the real problemwas with their code or the underlying algorithm. He subsequently developed a tool called <a href="https://primmdebug.web.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PRIMM Debug</a>, which supports a more reflective and systematic approach to debugging. This tool enables learners to slow down when they are programming and to be more reflective. You can read more about it <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/blog-introducing-primmdebug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Research Centre website</a>, and also catch up on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/debugging-positive-experience-secondary-school-students/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Foundation research seminar where he presented his work</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">EPICS: Physical computing in school</h2>



<p>As part of a 5-year longitudinal project, running across the whole UK and the first project of its kind, we are looking at how physical computing impacts primary and secondary school learners. We&#8217;re investigating the effect of physical computing on learners&#8217; creativity, agency and confidence, over time and at particular points known to be important for their subject choices. We are working with a wonderful set of partner primary schools who we visit each year.</p>

<p>This year we reported some of our first results, which <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3713043.3731552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">point to teachers’ perceptions of physical computing being engaging and inclusive for primary-aged children</a>. Starting next spring, we will be carrying out our third year of data collection with our pupil cohort, who have reached the age of 10 to 11.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll also be running a survey next summer for upper primary-aged children and their teachers. Please sign up for our <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/stayintouch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teacher Research Network newsletter</a> to be the first to hear about taking part in this survey.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Teacher Inquiry in Computing Education (TICE)</h2>



<p>As part of our TICE project we support teachers to conduct their own action research projects. This is a collaborative project, involving academics across the UK who volunteer to support teachers. The goal is to enable teachers to take a deep dive into a curriculum topic, a pedagogical approach, or a new resource, or to address a wider issue such as gender diversity or accessibility, to inform a change in their practice.</p>



<p>This year 16 teachers published their reports in our <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TICE3-Booklet-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teacher Research Booklet</a>, and many also presented their findings online at CAS events or at the KCL-CAS London conference and the CAS National Conference. We’re very proud of them!</p>

<p>Two remarkable teenagers from Pune in the state of Maharashtra, India — Jayantika (age 16) and Ruturaj (age 14) — have turned curiosity into community impact.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>With support from the Bidkar Foundation and the Raspberry Pi Foundation, they now help run five Code Clubs, reaching over 200 young people in rural areas of Pune. Along the way, they have twice received the Coolest Projects Judges’ Favourite Award: first online in 2023, and again at Coolest Projects India in September 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How it all began</h2>



<p>For Jayantika and Ruturaj, the spark for coding began at home. During the pandemic, when schools were closed and days felt long, their father encouraged them to try something new. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“When we were at home and there was nothing to do,” recalls Jayantika, “my dad introduced us to coding, and from that time till this date we are participating — and yeah, we love it.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2021, they joined their local Code Club, run by the Bidkar Foundation, which provides coding opportunities for young people in rural areas of Pune. That moment opened a door to creativity neither of them expected. Scratch projects soon filled their weekends with problem-solving, and Ruturaj found himself fascinated by how games worked. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I was too curious how games were made,” he says. “After a while in Code Club, I learned new things and got the answers to my questions.” </p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As their confidence grew, so did their sense of purpose. They wanted others to experience the same excitement they had discovered. “We thought these things should be shared with others,” says Jayantika. “So that’s why we started a Code Club and began teaching — to spread awareness and knowledge to everyone.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reaching out to rural learners</h2>



<p>Each weekend, Jayantika and Ruturaj set out for nearby villages, with laptops, lesson plans, and a sense of possibility. Their aim is simple but powerful: to bring coding opportunities to children who might otherwise never encounter them. “Village students must also learn coding and get opportunities to come in front,” explains Jayantika.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1040" height="780" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2.jpg" alt="Jayantika (age 16) and Ruturaj (age 14)" class="wp-image-92046" style="width:704px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2.jpg 1040w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1040px) 100vw, 1040px" /></figure></div>


<p>What started modestly — “one computer and seven students” — has become a thriving network of clubs that now reaches hundreds of young learners. Their father, Mr Bidkar, has been by their side throughout, watching as their initiative has grown from a small idea to something that’s changing lives. “Now we are 25 computers, 200-plus children,” he says proudly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Inside their Code Club sessions</h2>



<p>Their Code Club sessions are lively and filled with curiosity. Children crowd around laptops, excited to build their next animation or game. The mentors blend teaching with fun, alternating between theory and practice to keep things engaging. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“At first, we take theory classes — we explain what’s the game,” says Jayantika. “At the end we let them sit on computers.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some weeks are spent planning and others creating. “We give them a plan, and then next time they create,” she explains. Younger learners, aged six to ten, start with small projects such as animations or motion-based activities. Older learners tackle bigger challenges in Scratch, building their own games from ideas they’ve brainstormed together.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1040" height="780" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1.jpg" alt="Jayantika (age 16) and Ruturaj (age 14)" class="wp-image-92049" style="width:696px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1.jpg 1040w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1040px) 100vw, 1040px" /></figure></div>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Sessions end with a much-loved tradition: “After the session ends, we give them 15–20 minutes to do whatever they want,” says Ruturaj. “Because they’re very curious.” The pair work in perfect rhythm. “I manage one group and Ruturaj manages another,” says Jayantika. “If any doubt is there, we solve them together.”</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Mentoring has given both siblings new confidence and skills. “At first we were only on Scratch, and now we’ve expanded our knowledge,” says Jayantika. “Next, we’re going to start robotics. It is simple and it is creative also and it can connect to Scratch.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The role of a mentor</h2>



<p>Over time, Jayantika and Ruturaj have learned that mentoring is as much about listening as it is about instructing. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Sometimes their questions are not so obvious,” laughs Jayantika. “Like ‘Why can’t we change the sprite?’ or ‘Why can’t we use another block?’ We can explain to a certain limit, but after that we are speechless!” </p>
</blockquote>



<p>These moments, she says, are part of the magic of teaching. They push the mentors to explore new ways of explaining and to see coding from a beginner’s perspective again.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Watching their students succeed brings the biggest reward. “We feel very happy that the students are listening to us and they’re doing what we wanted — and they’re even adding extras,” says Jayantika. “Most of them tell us they want to create another project; they want more time.”</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>And for those thinking about becoming mentors, they both agree that empathy is key. “If you want to teach them, you must become a student,” says Ruturaj.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“First, think at the students’ level… explain in simple language and give more time to experiment,” adds Jayantika.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking ahead</h2>



<p>Ruturaj dreams of exploring game development and cybersecurity, while Jayantika hopes to move into web and app design. Together, they balance logic and creativity, each complementing the other’s strengths. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Even though both are coding, we are on different paths,” she smiles.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>For anyone curious about coding, Ruturaj’s advice is simple: “Do it by yourself. Make projects by yourself, share them, and learn from others.” Jayantika adds: “Coding has no limits. You can create anything you imagine — open your mind, open your creativity.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Their father, rightly, is proud not just of their achievements but of how they have inspired others to learn. From a single laptop to five thriving Code Clubs, Jayantika and Ruturaj’s journey shows what’s possible when young people lead with passion and purpose. With support from their family, the Bidkar Foundation, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s India team, they’re proving that talent truly is everywhere — opportunity just needs a spark.</p>



<p>Thank you, Jayantika and Ruturaj, for inspiring young people across India and around the world.</p>

<p>At a time when many young people are using AI for personal and learning purposes, schools are trying to figure out what to teach about AI and how (find out more in this <a href="https://literacytrust.org.uk/research-services/research-reports/young-people-and-teachers-use-of-generative-ai-to-support-literacy-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summer 2025 data about young people’s usage of AI in the UK</a>). One aspect of this is how technical we should get in explaining how AI works, particularly if we want to debunk naive views of the capabilities of the technology, such as that AI tools ‘think’. In this month’s research seminar, we found out how AI contexts can be added to current classroom maths to make maths more interesting and relevant while teaching the core concepts of AI.</p>

<p>At our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research-impact/research/seminars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">computing education research seminar</a> in July, a group of researchers from the <a href="https://www.cammp.online/english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAMMP</a> (Computational and Mathematical Modeling Program) research project shared their work:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Prof. Dr. <a href="https://www.scc.kit.edu/en/staff/martin.frank.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Frank</a>, Founder of CAMMP (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany).</li>

<li>Research Associate <a href="https://www.scc.kit.edu/en/staff/stephan.kindler.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephan Kindler</a> (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany)</li>
</ul>



<p>They talked about how maths already taught in secondary schools can be used to demystify AI. At first glance, this seems difficult to do, as it is often assumed that school-aged learners will not be able to understand how these systems work. This is especially the case for artificial neural networks, which are usually seen as a black box technology — they may be relatively easy to use, but it’s not as easy to understand how they work. Despite this, the Austrian and German team have developed a clear way to explain some of the fundamental elements of AI using school-based maths.</p>



<p>Sarah Schönbrodt started by challenging us to consider that learning maths is an essential part in developing AI skills, as:&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>AI systems using machine learning are data-driven and are based on mathematics, especially statistics and data</li>



<li>Authentic machine learning techniques can be used to bring to life existing classroom maths concepts</li>



<li>Real and relevant problems and associated data are available for teachers to use</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A set of workshops for secondary maths classrooms</strong></h2>



<p>Sarah explained how the CAMMP team have developed a range of teaching and learning materials on AI (and beyond) with an overall goal to “allow students to solve authentic, real and relevant problems using mathematical modeling and computers”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She reflected that much of school maths is set in contexts that are abstract, and may not be very interesting or relevant to students. Therefore, introducing AI-based contexts, which are having a huge impact on society and students’ lives, is both an opportunity to make maths more engaging and also a way to demystify AI.</p>

<p>Workshops designed and researched by the team include contexts such as privacy in social networks to learn about decision trees, personalised Netflix recommendations to learn about k-nearest neighbour, word predictions to learn about N-Grams, and predicting life expectancy to learn about regression and neural networks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learning about classification models: traffic lights and the support vector machine</strong></h2>



<p>For the seminar, Sarah walked through the steps to learn about support vector machines. This is an upper secondary workshop for students aged 17 to 18 years old. The context of the lesson is an image problem — specifically, classifying the data representing the colours of a simplified traffic light system (two lights to start with) to work out if a traffic light is red or green.</p>



<p>She walked through each of the steps of the maths workshop:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Plotting data points of two classes, the representation of green and red traffic lights</li>



<li>Finding a line that best separates the data points of both classes</li>



<li>Figuring out what best is</li>



<li>Classifying the data points in relation to the chosen (separating) line</li>



<li>Validating the model statistically to see if it is useful in classifying new data points, including using test data and creating a contingency table (also called a confusion matrix)</li>



<li>Discussing limitations, including social and ethical issues</li>



<li>Explaining how three traffic lights can be expressed as three-dimensional data by using planes</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learning about social and ethical issues</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1232" height="682" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7.png" alt="" class="wp-image-92027" style="width:731px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7.png 1232w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-300x166.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-500x277.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-768x425.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-800x443.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-450x249.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-900x498.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1232px) 100vw, 1232px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Learning about the social and ethical issues in data-driven systems. (Slide from the researchers&#8217; presentation.)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As well as learning about lines, planes, distances, dot product and statistical measures, learners are also engaged in discussing the social and ethical issues of the approach taken. They are encouraged to think about bias, data diversity, privacy, and the impact of errors on people. For example, if the model wrongly predicts a light as green when it is red, then an autonomous car would run through a red traffic light. This would likely be a bigger consequence than stopping at a green traffic light that was mis-predicted as red. So should the best line reduce this kind of error?</p>



<p>To teach the workshops, Sarah explained they have developed interactive Jupyter notebooks, where no programming skills are needed. Students fill in the gaps of example code, explore simulations, and write their ideas for discussion for the whole class. No software needs to be installed, feedback is direct, and there are in-depth tasks and staggered hints.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learning about regression models: Weather forecasting and the toy artificial neural network</strong></h2>



<p>Stephan went on to introduce artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are the basis of generative AI applications like chatbots and image generation systems. He focused on regression models, such as those used in weather forecasting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ANNs are very complex. Therefore, to start to understand the fundamentals of this technology, he introduced a ‘toy ANN’ with one input, three nodes, and one output. A function is performed on the input data at each node. With the toy network, the team wants to tackle a major and common misconception: that students think that ANN systems learn, recognise, see, and understand, when really it&#8217;s all just maths.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1239" height="694" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-92029" style="width:776px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3.png 1239w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-300x168.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-500x280.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-768x430.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-800x448.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-450x252.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-900x504.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1239px) 100vw, 1239px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tackling misconceptions about ANNs by exploring how they work in a toy version. (Slide from the researchers&#8217; presentation.)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The learning activity starts by looking at one node with one input and one output, and can be described as a mathematical function, with a concatenation of two functions (in this case a linear and activation function). Stephan shared an <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/kpjk8qb6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online simulator</a> that visualises how the toy neural network can be explored as students change two parameters (in this case, weight and bias of the functions). Students then look at the overall network, and the way that the output from the three nodes is combined. Again, they can explore this in the simulator. Students compare simple data about weather prediction to the model, and discover they need more functions — more nodes to better fit the data. The activity helps students learn that ANN systems are just highly adjustable mathematical functions that, by adding nodes, can approximate relationships in a given data set. But the approximation only works in the bounds (intervals) in which data points are given, showing that ANNs do not ‘understand’ or ’know’ — it&#8217;s just maths.</p>



<p>Stephen finished by explaining the mutual benefits of AI education and maths education. He suggested maths will enable a deeper understanding of AI, and give students a way to realistically assess the opportunities and risks of AI tools and show them the role that humans have in designing AI systems. He also explained that classroom maths education can benefit from incorporating AI contexts. This approach highlights how maths underpins the design and understanding of everyday systems, supports more effective teaching, and promotes an interdisciplinary way of learning across subjects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some personal reflections — which may not be quite right!</strong></h2>



<p>I have been researching the teaching of AI and machine learning for around five years now, since before ChatGPT and other similar tools burst on the scene. Since then, I have seen an increasing number of resources to teach about the social and ethical issues of the topic, and there are a bewildering number of learning activities and tools for students to train simple models. There are frameworks for the data lifecycle, and an emerging set of activities to follow to prepare data, compare model types, and deploy simple applications. However, I felt the need to understand and to teach about, at a very simple level, the basic building blocks of data-driven technologies. When I heard the CAMMP team present their work at the <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=AIDEA/2025/Symposium#tab-keynote-presentation-45-minutes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIDEA conference in February 2025</a>, I was entirely amazed and I asked them to present here at our research seminar series. This was a piece of the puzzle that I had been searching for — a way to explain the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘bottom of the technical stack of fundamental concepts’</a>. The team is taking very complex ideas and reducing them to such an extent that we can use secondary classroom maths to show that AI is not magic and AI systems do not think. It&#8217;s just maths. The maths is still hard, and teachers will still need the skills to carefully guide students step by step so they can build a useful mental model.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1300" height="731" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event.png" alt="Photo of a class of students at computers, in a computer science classroom." class="wp-image-91975" style="width:794px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event.png 1300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-900x506.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></figure></div>


<p>I think we can simplify these ideas further, and create unplugged activities, simulations, and ways for students to explore these basic building blocks of data representation, as well as classification and representing approximations of complex patterns and prediction. I can sense the beginnings of new ideas in computational thinking, though they’re still taking shape. We’re researching these further and will keep you updated.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tackling taboo topics</strong></h2>



<p>The idea for Flow Body began when Inilouwa was inspired by her sister’s experience at school.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“So, for me, it was my sister actually, that really inspired this project because she would tell me, her school at the time, they run out of period products very frequently, so not a lot of girls could access it.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wanting to make a difference, the team created Flow Body, a website connecting young women to period charities in the UK and providing reliable information about periods, puberty, and related health issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Playing to their strengths</strong></h2>



<p>The technical side of the project was led by Inilouwa, with the rest of her teammates supporting her with research and content creation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“So, alongside Michelle, I researched the diseases and what can come from period poverty and how different people get by with the lack of period products around,” Jedidiah said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their research highlighted just how widespread period-related health issues are.</p>



<p>The team discovered that one of the biggest challenges is access to accurate information, given the stigma around discussing menstruation, and using technology to solve this issue seemed like the perfect fit to them.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Inilouwa explained, “Having that access to information that&#8217;s tailored to young women, to young parents, to everyone all across the board would be really helpful, you know, in order to make periods less of a strange topic to discuss.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Celebrating teamwork</strong></h2>



<p>After taking home judges’ favourite in the web category, the girls could not recommend the experience enough. When asked what advice they would give to other young people thinking of taking the leap and entering Coolest Projects, the answer was simple…</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Do it. Don&#8217;t be afraid. Even if tech is not your thing, it&#8217;s not a lot of people&#8217;s things. But like you learn so much, you grow so much and it&#8217;s very fun. It is. It really is,” said Inilouwa.</p>

<p>Listening to the voices of young people is crucial in creating genuinely effective learning resources. That&#8217;s why we recently ran a survey of students who use Ada Computer Science, our platform designed to help students learn and revise key computer science concepts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The different topics are nicely categorised and it is easy to find the information I wish to revise.” – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We were delighted to hear from 103 students, most of whom are 16–19 years old and studying in England, and their insights are invaluable in helping us to continue to develop Ada CS.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Students think Ada CS is high quality and useful</h2>



<p>The most common ways students use Ada CS are for revision and to check whether they understand concepts. The majority of respondents are building Ada CS into their regular study habits, with over half of respondents using the platform every week.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-500x281.png" alt="Photo of a class of students at computers, in a computer science classroom." class="wp-image-91975" style="width:682px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-900x506.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event.png 1300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>We were pleased to see the benefits of updates we’ve made, including a redesign of the question finder released in March 2025 — students reported that it is easy to navigate the platform and find what they need: 81% reported being able to find relevant content, and 77% could find the questions they were looking for.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It&#8217;s SO EASY to find exactly what I want.” – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Overall, students perceive Ada CS as both <strong>useful</strong> for learning about computer science concepts and of <strong>high quality</strong>. They reported finding the content clear, with a good level of detail.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The topics are broken down into easily digestible sections, and the provided diagrams really help with understanding the topics.”&nbsp; – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The resource is really well designed, short and concise.”&nbsp; – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also received helpful suggestions for future improvements. Students shared feedback on how the information on the platform is presented, asking for more concise, revision-friendly content as well as guidance for exploring concepts in more depth. We’ll therefore be looking into alternative ways to structure content as we continue to develop Ada CS.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="495" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-800x495.png" alt="Graph depicting how strongly students felt that Ada Computer Science helps them to learn about computer science concepts." class="wp-image-91968" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-800x495.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-300x186.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-500x309.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-768x475.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-1536x950.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-450x278.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2-900x557.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image2.png 1904w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Students rate the quizzes highly</h2>



<p>The most popular feature is the <strong>quizzes and practice questions</strong>,<strong> </strong>including the immediate feedback and hints provided. Students value how these resources help them solidify their knowledge, learn from mistakes, and prepare for assessments.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The questions are clear and make me think, they&#8217;re relevant to my studies and the hints for the questions are very useful.” – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also appreciated the suggestions we received for how we can further develop this feature, for example, creating more questions, extending the range of question types per topic, and making improvements to the hints.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Impact on learning</h2>



<p>Students also feel that using Ada CS has a tangible impact on their learning. 82% agreed they were more confident that they understand CS concepts as a result of using Ada CS<strong> </strong>and 79% feel more confident learning about computer science concepts without a teacher to explain.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I do CS A level but I hadn&#8217;t done the GCSE and I found that all of the resources gave me enough information to learn the concepts from scratch and now I&#8217;m much more confident in my knowledge of the theory.” – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="648" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-800x648.png" alt="Graph depicting how students feel using Ada CS has on their learning." class="wp-image-91969" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-800x648.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-300x243.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-500x405.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-768x622.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-1536x1244.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-450x364.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1-900x729.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/image1.png 1862w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s coming next?</h2>



<p>Students provided us with lots of useful feedback and suggestions for how we can further improve Ada CS, especially relating to practice questions. We’re already working on adding more questions across topics, creating more challenging questions, and adding more question types that will enhance students’ learning experience. We’ve got some other exciting developments in the pipeline too, which we’ll announce soon!</p>



<p>Thank you to everyone who took the time to complete the survey. These findings are invaluable for shaping the future of Ada Computer Science, helping us to continue to provide the best possible learning platform for students.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exploring new technologies and inclusive teaching</strong></h2>



<p>Saturday began with hands-on sessions that brought creativity and technology together, exploring large language models and prompt engineering in <em>Collaborating with LLMs and being a prompt boss</em>. There was a lot of laughter from attendees about how large language models can produce confident but incorrect answers if given vague prompts, but many left inspired to experiment with new technologies in their own clubs.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“First time there and it was amazing. Met loads of great people and the amazing code club crew. I learnt loads of new skills around AI and Arduino.” – An attendee</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learning and making across continents</strong></h2>



<p>The weekend’s talks showcased the reach of Code Club worldwide, with volunteers sharing their experiences of collaboration, sustainability, and creativity.</p>



<p>Watch<em> </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/zYqSiUoO2Ao?t=3597s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lessons from resourceful Code Clubs in India</em></a>, which highlighted the ingenuity of young learners in under-resourced settings, while <em>Hands-on with the Raspberry Pi Pico </em>showcased low-cost, high-impact projects from Kenya and South Africa.</p>



<p>Speakers showed how community clubs adapt to local needs with unplugged activities and coding games inspired by cricket and kabaddi, empowering young people to solve real problems and celebrate curiosity through play. Excitingly, these new resources will be launching early next year; <a href="https://codeclub.org/en/resources/activities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep an eye on our activities page</a> to be among the first to try them out!</p>

<p>In the session <em>Code Club Projects Unplugged,</em> facilitators shared the idea of “hiding the vegetables” — hiding the learning inside the fun. Whether through a collaborative Scratch game, a micro:bit prop on stage, or a Pico gadget solving a real problem, this approach helps young people learn through play. They remember the joy, and the skills come naturally.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learning beyond the screen</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3dwzJim0AzI?t=1568s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Teaching tech away from the computer screen</em></a> shared a fun unplugged cybersecurity activity, <em>The Chicken Shop</em>, where learners role-play social engineering scenarios. Its success came from clear printed instructions, movement, humour, and strong debriefing.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3dwzJim0AzI?t=3178s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Learning coding outside the box</em></a> explored how to engage young people with diverse learning styles while the Arduino crash course gave attendees a taste of physical computing and C++ programming in action. Workshops on AI, sustainability, and youth empowerment with Raspberry Pi computers and <em>Unlocking Code Club resources</em> helped club leaders discover practical ways to inspire problem-solving and make use of all the support available through Code Club.</p>



<p>The message from the sessions was clear: young people learn best when technology is human and hands-on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Showcasing creativity with Coolest Projects</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3dwzJim0AzI?t=10265s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Coolest Projects – get involved!</em> </a>championed creativity over competition. Any young person under 18 can submit their project, including unfinished ideas. In-person and online showcases celebrate progress, imagination, and teamwork.</p>



<p>Speaking on the closing panel, Code Club leader Rachael Coultart talked about the importance of Coolest Projects as a rare platform for children to talk about their learning. She spoke about the experience of one particular child, explaining that it had made a powerful impression on her, saying:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It had such a huge impact. I felt so proud of her and what she’d achieved. Afterwards, her parents told me that they felt it was the first time she had really been seen.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the community is taking forward</strong></h2>



<p>The community is united in its commitment to making Code Clubs inclusive, creative, and sustainable.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Context matters — projects that reflect local interests and challenges motivate young people to learn</li>



<li>Accessibility is central: visual cues, repetition, interpreters, and inclusive resources support every learner</li>



<li>Structure builds confidence; start with simple, guided activities before open-ended exploration</li>



<li>Volunteers are vital; shared toolkits, checklists, and training help them deliver engaging sessions</li>



<li>Celebration and affordability matter too: regular showcases and tools like the micro:bit, Pico, and Crumble keep computing fun, hands-on, and accessible for all</li>
</ul>

<p>In this blog post, we are pleased to share <a href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/astro-pi/Astro_Pi_Impact_Report_2025.pdf">the Astro Pi 2024/25 impact report</a>, where we look at ways in which the Astro Pi Challenge is bringing value to the lives of many young people and mentors, based on survey responses and interviews. Along the way, we’ll debunk some myths about space science.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Astro Pi makes space science accessible</h2>



<p>Here at the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we’ve heard a few myths about space science and coding, and how daunting it can be to write a computer program, let alone one that can run in space. We can&#8217;t let these myths stand — instead we’re going to debunk them, equipped with evidence we’ve collected about the 2024/25 Astro Pi Challenge and previous challenge rounds.</p>

<p>Read on for some astronomical facts from our latest impact report, and get ready to help young people in your community send their code into space.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Myth 1: You have to be a rocket scientist to send things into space</h3>



<p>Not true! In the Astro Pi Challenge 2024/25, young people created over 17,800 computer programs that ran on board the International Space Station (ISS). Teams of young people aged between 8 and 19 took part in the challenge in a range of settings, including schools, Code Clubs, libraries, and community youth groups. They wrote short programs in Python, which were then sent to run on special Raspberry Pi computers, called Astro Pis, in the Columbus module of the ISS.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1417" height="797" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis.jpg" alt="The Astro Pi computers." class="wp-image-91911" style="width:726px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis.jpg 1417w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Astro-PI-IRvis-900x506.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1417px) 100vw, 1417px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Astro Pi computers up close.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Since the first Astro Pis arrived on the ISS in 2015, over 160,000 young people have had their code run in space. To celebrate their achievements, they each received certificates with the exact time and location of the ISS when their programs ran.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;We want our code to run in space! We are fascinated by discovery and the opportunity to contribute to a real science experiment on the ISS.&#8221; – Mission Space Lab mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Myth 2: Only experienced programmers can write code for the International Space Station</h3>



<p>Not true! The Astro Pi Challenge is made up of two missions, Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab, and Mission Zero is perfect for young people who are new to text-based coding. With the help of <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astro-pi-mission-zero">step-by-step project instructions</a>, young people write a short Python program to display personalised pixel art on board the ISS, using data from a sensor on one of the Astro Pi computers in their image.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2268" height="1276" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828.jpg" alt="Young people writing Mission Zero programs." class="wp-image-91912" style="width:722px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828.jpg 2268w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-IMG_3828-900x506.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2268px) 100vw, 2268px" /></figure></div>


<p>In fact, Mission Zero mentors find that the low-stakes nature of the activity coupled with the real-world connection to space create an ideal learning environment. 83% of Mission Zero 2024/25 mentors told us that participation increased young people’s skills and confidence in computing and digital making, and 78% believed that young people were likely to participate in other computing or digital making challenges in the future.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“They [young people] come from complicated environments and sometimes their confidence is very low. They don’t believe in themselves and this [Mission Zero] really empowers them.” – Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Myth 3: Learning to write code for the ISS only involves technical skills</h3>



<p>Not true! Mission Zero engages young people in thinking creatively as they plan their artwork, and Mission Space Lab involves working in teams to write a computer program to solve a scientific task in space, combining teamwork, problem-solving, and knowledge from other scientific domains. While 100% of mentors whose teams successfully completed Mission Space Lab in 2024/25 agreed that participation improved young people’s skills in computing and digital making, 91% also confirmed that it increased young people’s confidence in these areas, and 91% told us that it increased young people’s understanding of STEM concepts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impact likely goes beyond building skills. Mentors from both Astro Pi 2024/25 missions told us that the challenge made young people feel connected to a wider community of learners around the world, and the excitement of the challenge also extended to the mentors themselves, as well as other adults in their community.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Mission Zero is a way of connecting not only to a worldwide group of learners, but also to explorers, future scientists, and future astronauts. To see them as part of a larger community and not just an activity or assignment that they have to do in class.” – Mission Zero mentor</p>

<p>One of the things I love most about my role as Chief Learning Officer at the Raspberry Pi Foundation is hearing from teachers around the world. A teacher in Kenya told me how their students debugged their first programming projects on a shared laptop. In Scotland, another explained how our resources gave them the confidence to teach computing for the very first time. These stories remind me daily why our work matters: <strong>every young person, no matter where they live, should have the chance to explore the power of computing.</strong></p>

<p>But creating resources that work in such different contexts is not easy. How do we design materials that work in a wide range of learning environments, from a bustling city classroom to a rural school where internet access can vary? How do we make sure that every learner sees themselves reflected in the examples we choose?</p>



<p>That’s where our <strong>teaching and learning design principles</strong> come in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What makes our approach different</strong></h2>



<p>Over the past decade, we’ve learned a huge amount about what teachers and learners need from us. We’ve made mistakes, we’ve listened, and we’ve refined our practice again and again. The result is a set of design principles that guide the creation of everything we make, from full curricula to one-off projects.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-800x533.jpg" alt="Four students at laptops in a school in India." class="wp-image-91402" style="width:711px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<p>These principles are practical and based on real classroom experience. They’re our way of making sure our resources are reliable, inspiring, and flexible, wherever and however teachers use them.</p>



<p>Here’s what that looks like in action:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>High quality</strong> – You can trust our resources to be accurate and classroom-ready. We put every piece of content through rigorous checks because we understand how busy you are.<br></li>



<li><strong>Research-informed</strong> – Our choices are grounded in evidence, not guesswork. We blend academic studies with insight from teachers like you and our own evaluations to create approaches that genuinely work.<br></li>



<li><strong>Consistent</strong> – We design our materials to fit together, so learners can build skills step by step, without confusion or contradiction along the way.<br></li>



<li><strong>Inclusive by design</strong> – We think carefully about accessibility, representation, and language right from the start. When young people see themselves reflected in computing, they see it as a future they can be a part of.<br></li>



<li><strong>Adaptable</strong> – No two classrooms are the same. By making our resources editable and flexible, we give you the freedom to shape them for your learners.</li>
</ul>

</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why share these design principles now?</strong></h2>



<p>For us, being transparent about our approach is about trust. Teachers make daily decisions about which resources to use, often with limited preparation time. By showing you the principles behind our work, we want to give you the confidence that our content is not only free and adaptable, but also designed with care, expertise, and your learners at the heart.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking ahead</strong></h2>



<p>The world of computing education is moving fast, from new programming software, to artificial intelligence tools. Our design principles give us a strong foundation to keep innovating while staying true to our mission of <strong>enabling young people to realise their full potential through the power of computing and digital technologies.</strong></p>

<p>Social media can have a powerful impact on the way we see and experience the world. What we see in our feeds is not random: it is determined by AI-driven systems that collect vast amounts of data, build user profiles, analyse engagement, and generate recommendations. But while <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/siteassets/resources/documents/research-and-data/media-literacy-research/children/children-media-use-and-attitudes-2024/childrens-media-literacy-report-2024.pdf?v=368229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">young people are prolific users of social media</a>, studies show that many have little understanding of what is happening ‘under the hood’</p>

<p>In our September research seminar, we welcomed back <strong>Henriikka Vartiainen</strong> and <strong>Matti Tedre</strong> from the University of Eastern Finland. They introduced <em>Somekone</em>, a social media simulator that is designed to help learners understand some of the fundamental processes behind social media platforms. Their team has been developing AI education materials and tools since 2019, including <a href="https://tm.gen-ai.fi/image/general" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GenAI Teachable Machine</a>, which they presented at our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/opening-the-box-tools-to-teach-young-people-about-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May research seminar</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Collaboration and co-design</h2>



<p>Henriikka explained that the development of the <em>Somekone</em> tool emerged from the team’s long-term collaboration with teachers and schools in Finland. They co-developed the tool with the aim of making concepts like data collection, engagement, profiling, recommendations, filter bubbles, and polarisation visible and explainable for students aged 11 to 13 years old.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A four-phase learning model</h2>



<p>Henriikka described the <strong>pedagogical model</strong> that the team follows in all of their AI education interventions. Their goal is not only to support students to develop their understanding of AI concepts, but also to foster ethical awareness and a sense of agency.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Phase 1: Contextualisation and familiarisation</strong><strong><br></strong>Students begin by discussing their experiences with social media and their initial ideas about how platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram work. This activates students’ prior knowledge and helps connect the learning to their own interests. It also enables teachers to uncover any misconceptions the students may have.<br></li>



<li><strong>Phase 2: Exploration</strong><strong><br></strong>Students explore their initial ideas by experimenting with the <em>Somekone </em>tool. They discover how different types of data are collected and combined for profiling in a way that connects these new concepts to their own everyday lives.<br></li>



<li><strong>Phase 3: Design and inquiry<br></strong>Students explore the <em>Somekone</em> tool more deeply. Teachers guide them through activities where the students analyse, interpret, and discuss the data they can see in the tool. Importantly, the data they are using has all been gathered from their activity on the platform. Students can see how the likes, follows, and comments they and their classmates make change the images they are shown, and this is all real time.<br></li>



<li><strong>Phase 4: Ethical and societal reflection<br></strong>Students reflect on what they have learnt and consider the broader impacts of social media. Teachers encourage them to think critically, question the way social media platforms currently work, and imagine alternatives. At the end of the project, students write letters to decision-makers with their suggestions for how social media could better serve children’s interests.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Inside the simulator</h2>



<p>Matti then gave a live demonstration of <em>Somekone</em>. Nothing compares to seeing the tool in action, so do check out the video of his demo here!</p>



<p>Students log on to the tool and are presented with an Instagram-style feed of images. They scroll through the feed and like, share, or comment on images that catch their attention or match their interests. For many students this is a very familiar type of environment, and they really enjoy playing with the app!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="533" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-800x533.jpg" alt="Four young people sitting at their desks, on their mobile phones." class="wp-image-90246" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/pexels-rdne-6936147-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<p>However, the unique value of <em>Somekone</em> is that it provides students with a real-time view of the way data is collected from every single user interaction, and demonstrates what is done with that data. It also allows students to experiment with a social media tool in the classroom without any data protection issues, as all of the data is stored locally.</p>



<p>Learners explore:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Data collection in real time</strong>. Working in pairs, one student browses the image feed, while the other watches a live view of the data that the simulator is collecting every time their partner interacts with or simply pauses on a post.<br></li>



<li><strong>Profile building</strong>. <em>Somekone</em> shows how all this data accumulates to build a profile. Students watch their profiles developing based on the way they and their classmates are interacting with their feeds.<br></li>



<li><strong>Clustering and connections</strong>. Students then see how the tool groups profiles to create clusters of users with similar interests. Often friendship groups in the classroom are evident on screen because students sitting next to each other have all chosen to engage with the same things!</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><em>The simulator creates clusters of users with similar interests, which update in real time as students interact with posts on their feeds</em></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Explainable recommendations</strong>. A key feature of <em>Somekone</em> is that it provides explanations for why it recommends posts to users. Students learn that recommendations can be based on various things, such as the image’s tag matching the tag on other posts they liked, or the image being popular among other users with similar profiles to theirs. These are the mechanisms that underpin real recommendation systems, but <em>Somekone</em> makes them explicit.</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size"><em>The tool provides an explanation for why each post is recommended</em></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Filter bubbles and polarisation</strong>. A filter bubble forms when a user only sees social media posts that match their existing interests or beliefs, due to highly personalised recommendation systems. <em>Somekone</em> presents this concept in a visually compelling way through a heatmap showing all the content in the system, with a colour scale indicating which posts are most likely to be shown to a particular user, and which they will never encounter. By comparing different users’ filter bubbles side by side, students start to understand how polarisation can arise. As Matti said: “If our feeds are so different from each other that I never see the pictures that you see and you never see the pictures I see, then [&#8230;] we don&#8217;t even share the same reality”.</li>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Algorithm settings</strong>. A key learning opportunity is that students can adjust the algorithm’s parameters and observe how this changes their feed and their filter bubble. They can choose between personalised or non-personalised recommendations, select how posts are ranked, and decide whether to allow any diversity in the popularity of posts recommended to them. This is key to ‘opening up the box’.</li>
</ul>



<p>For teachers, the tool has a simple guided interface to make it easy to use in class. There is also a button that teachers can use to pause the app, stopping students from scrolling (much to their dismay!) in order to focus their attention on the teacher when they are explaining concepts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Evidence of impact</h2>



<p>The research team used pre- and post-tests to evaluate what impact the intervention had on students’ understanding of social media mechanisms and on their sense of agency in relation to data. They conducted the post-test a week after the intervention, and then also did a delayed post-test six months later to see whether any changes were sustained. They found:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Improved understanding of key concepts</strong>. Learners showed statistically significant improvements in identifying different types of data traces and in understanding how data profiling works. They also showed some improvement in grasping recommendation mechanisms.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Retention over time</strong>. These improvements were generally still evident six months later, particularly in the case of understanding data traces.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stronger sense of agency</strong>. The team found that students’ sense of data agency improved after taking part in the intervention. This is really important as students are more likely to want to study a topic further if they have feelings of agency and self-efficacy.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Accessing the tool</h2>



<p>The <em>Somekone </em>tool is freely available online — in Finnish, English, German, and French — at <a href="https://somekone.gen-ai.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somekone.gen-ai.fi</a>. The developer Nick Pope has also made the source code available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/knicos/genai-somekone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">github.com/knicos/genai-somekone</a>. </p>



<p>However, the supporting materials and teacher resources are currently only available in Finnish and the underpinning pedagogies relate to the Finnish context.</p>
