<p>With the new academic year fully under way in many parts of the world, it&#8217;s the perfect time to reflect on the growth and innovations we&#8217;ve achieved with <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Ada Computer Science platform</a>. Your feedback has helped us make improvements to better support teachers and students — here&#8217;s a look back at some of the key developments for Ada from the past 12 months.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Supporting students through personalised learning, new resources, and new questions</strong></h2>



<p>We made significant improvements throughout the year to support students with exam preparation and personalised learning. We introduced over 145 new self-marking questions and updated 50 existing ones, bringing the total to <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/questions?examBoard=ada&amp;examBoards=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 1000</a>. A new type of question was also launched to help students practise writing longer responses: they label parts of a sample answer and apply a mark scheme, simulating a peer review process. You can read more about this work in the AI section below.</p>



<p>We updated the question finder tool with an intuitive new design. Instead of seeing ten questions at random, students can now see all the questions we have on any given topic, and can use the filters to refine their searches by qualification and difficulty level. This enables students to better personalise their revision and progress tracking</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Ada Computer Science has been very effective for my revision. I like how it provides hints and pointers if you answer a question incorrectly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>– Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/topics/sound_representation?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Representation of sound’</a> topic received a major update, with clearer explanations, new diagrams, and improved feedback to support students as they tackle common misconceptions in sound physics. We also refreshed the <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/topics/number_representation?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Representation of numbers’</a> topic, adding new content and interactive quizzes to support teachers in assessing students&#8217; understanding more effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We introduced a new database scenario titled <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/topics/projdb_repair_and_reform?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Repair &amp; Reform’</a>, offering an entity relationship diagram, a data dictionary, and a new SQL editor and question set to help students prepare for project-based assessments. We&#8217;ve further expanded this scenario into a <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/topics/projdb_repair_and_reform?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full project</a> covering all stages of development, including requirements analysis and evaluation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>April was dedicated to gearing up for the exam season, with the introduction of revision flashcards and ready-made quizzes on key topics like bitmapped graphics and sorting algorithms. We also launched <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/pages/student_challenges?examBoard=all&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a student revision challenge</a>, which ran from April to June and attracted over 600 participants.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Ada Computer Science is an excellent resource to help support teachers and students. The explanations are clear and relevant, and the questions help students test their knowledge and understanding in a structured way, providing links to help them reconcile any discrepancies or misunderstandings.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>– Patrick Kennedy, Computer Science teacher</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Supporting teachers</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We expanded our efforts to support new computer science teachers with the launch of <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/pages/teacher_mentoring_2024?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a teacher mentoring programme</a> that offers free online drop-in sessions. We also hosted a teacher training event at the Raspberry Pi Foundation office in Cambridge (as seen in the picture below), where educators saw previews of upcoming content on AI and machine learning and contributed their own questions to the platform.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13-500x333.jpg" alt="Group photo featuring computer science teachers and colleagues from the Raspberry PI Foundation." class="wp-image-88014" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/08/ada-event-13.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI content and AI features</strong></h2>



<p>We continued our focus on AI and machine learning, <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/topics?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing new learning resources</a> that explore the ethical and social implications of AI alongside the practical applications of AI and machine learning models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To expand the Ada platform&#8217;s features, we also made considerable progress in integrating a large language model (LLM) to mark free-text responses. Our research showed that, as of June, LLM marks matched real teachers&#8217; marks 82% of the time. In July, we received ethics approval from the University of Cambridge to add LLM-marked questions to the Ada platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Computer science education in Scotland</strong></h2>



<p>We made significant strides towards supporting Scottish teachers and students with <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/exam_specifications_scotland?examBoard=ada&amp;stage=all#scotland_national_5/sqa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resources tailored to the SQA Computing Science curriculum</a>. From September to November last year, we piloted a new set of materials specifically designed for Scottish teachers, receiving valuable feedback that we&#8217;ve used in 2024 to develop new content. More than half of the theory content for the National 5 and Higher specifications is now available on the platform.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="500" height="332" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-500x332.png" alt="Teacher, in the middle of a computing lesson." class="wp-image-88585" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-500x332.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-300x199.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-768x509.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-800x531.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-450x298.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2-900x597.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/image2.png 1191w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Our ‘Reform &amp; Repair’ database scenario and project align with both SQA Higher and A level standards, providing a comprehensive resource for students preparing for project-based assessments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking ahead: New resources for September and beyond</strong></h2>



<p>We have big plans for Ada for the next 12 months. Our focus will remain on continuously improving our resources and supporting the needs of both educators and students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the positive response to our ‘Repair &amp; Reform’ database project, our content experts are planning additional practical projects to support students and teachers. The next one will be a web project that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, supporting students taking SQA qualifications in Scotland or undertaking the non-examined assessment (NEA) at A level.</p>



<p>We’ll be working on a number of teacher-focused improvements to the platform, which you’ll also see on Ada&#8217;s sibling site, <a href="https://isaacphysics.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Isaac Physics</a>. These will include an overhaul of the markbook to make it more user-friendly, and updates to the ‘Assignments’ tool so assignments better meet the needs of teachers in schools.</p>



<p>We’ll be welcoming the next cohort of computer science students to the STEM SMART programme in January 2025 where, in partnership with the University of Cambridge, we’ll offer free, complementary teaching and support to UK students at state schools. <a href="https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/stem-smart">Applications are now open</a>.</p>



<p>Thank you to every teacher and student who has given their time in the last year to share feedback about <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/">Ada Computer Science</a> — your insights are invaluable as we work to make high-quality computer science materials easily accessible. Here&#8217;s to another fantastic year of learning and growth!</p>

<p>When you walk into a vibrant Code Club, it is easy to see that the young creators are having fun with digital making. But are they actually learning anything? Our recent evaluation has shown that not only are they developing their coding skills, but there are many other benefits.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="283" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2021/07/CC_TESCO_005-500x283.jpg" alt="Young person sitting at a laptop with an adult mentor helping them with their code.

<p><a href="https://codeclub.org">Code Club</a> is a network of free coding clubs where young people learn how to create with technology. The Raspberry Pi Foundation supports Code Clubs through training and guidance for mentors, and by providing learning resources that lead to meaningful and lasting learning outcomes for the young people attending the clubs.</p>



<p>Founded in the UK in 2012, Code Club has grown into a global movement and has already inspired more than 2 million young people to learn how to build their own apps, games, animations, websites, and so much more. We are incredibly proud of the impact Code Club has already achieved and we want many more young people to benefit. Our ambitious goal for the next decade is to reach 10 million more young people through Code Club.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New impact insights about Code Club</strong></h2>



<p>We&#8217;re ambitious about Code Club because we know it works. Over the last year, the <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/evidence-centre-education/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Durham University Evidence Centre for Education (DECE)</a> conducted an independent evaluation of the programme that confirmed <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2017/03/Randomised-Controlled-Trial-and-Process-Evaluation-of-Code-Clubs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier evidence</a>: attending Code Club leads to positive outcomes for young people.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-500x333.jpg" alt="Two young people smiling whilst working on their laptop with an adult mentor by their side." class="wp-image-88616" style="width:500px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>The DECE evaluation showed that young people who attend Code Club build their coding skills. They also become more confident in learning coding, grow their interest in it, and develop a sense of belonging. Researchers observed how each young person has their individual projects to work on, which promote a sense of ownership and personalised learning, but that there are also opportunities for collaboration and celebrating their achievements with other creators in the club.</p>



<p>Young people also develop positive attitudes to coding and a range of life skills such as problem solving and communication. These skills and mindsets prepare young people to confidently engage with emerging technologies and with learning in a broader context.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“Coding is really fun when I know what to do, but sometimes it is hard. But I always keep trying.”</em> </p>



<p>– Code Club creator.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another finding was that Code Clubs are a place where young people who experience difficulties in formal classroom settings can thrive. This suggests Code Clubs can help educators engage a more diverse group of young people in creating with technology than formal education alone could.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“We see pupils in completely different roles when they are doing these Code Club activities. They enjoy more, and you can see they have skills to do things that we otherwise don’t notice.”</em> </p>



<p>– Code Club mentor.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>None of the benefits for young people would be possible without the volunteers who give their time and make Code Clubs the positive learning environments they are. Their support is crucial to young people’s engagement and skill development. The evaluation showed that mentors find the experience of volunteering rewarding, and pointed us towards areas where we can offer further support to help them run engaging, impactful Code Clubs.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“…volunteering with Code Club has helped me feel I’m a useful member of society in my old age, so the benefits have been good for me too.”</em></p>



<p> – Code Club mentor.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How we&#8217;re building on our support for clubs</strong></h2>



<p>With AI already transforming so many parts of our lives, learning how to create with technology has never been more important. Generative AI is changing how humans give instructions to computers, and at Code Club, young people can experiment with new technologies such as AI in a safe environment. New projects that support young people to learn about AI technologies will be added to the <a href="https://codeclub.org/en/learn-to-code">Code Club Projects site</a> later this month, alongside support for club leaders and mentors on this topic.</p>



<p>The evaluation methods used by the DECE will help us hone our ongoing impact measurement work for Code Clubs running in communities all over the world. As we continue to support Code Clubs, we are taking into account that the independent evaluation ran in school-based Code Clubs in the UK only. In our work to grow the Code Club network across the globe, we are adapting our support and resources for local contexts in collaboration with partners who share their expertise.</p>



<p>This will ensure that Code Clubs can provide a fun, welcoming space for all young people. And while they’re having fun, they will also gain relevant learning experiences that empower them to engage confidently with a world that is being transformed by digital technologies.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the DECE evaluation&#8217;s results, we&#8217;ve put together a <a href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/about/Code_Club_Summary_Report_Durham-Oct_2024.pdf">summary</a> for you to download.</p>

<p>The Code Editor is designed for learning, rather than for professional use, and is informed by our understanding of pedagogy and computing education. It can be accessed from a web browser without installing any additional software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we announced that we’d be <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/code-editor-classroom-management/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introducing classroom management features</a> and we’re now pleased to confirm that we’ve launched the beta version of <a href="https://editor.raspberrypi.org/en/education" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Editor for Education</a> with school accounts.<strong> </strong>You can be the first to try out the new features, together with the many schools who have chosen to pre-register their school accounts.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Simple and easy classroom management</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve kept the educator interface clean, simple, and easy to use. School owners can invite other teachers to join, add students, organise students into classes, and help students reset their passwords quickly. Educators can create coding projects to share with students and view their work.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>All features, totally free</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve added these classroom management features because one of the key problems we’ve seen educators face over the past months has been the lack of an affordable tool to teach text-based coding in the classroom. We will always provide the Code Editor and all of its features to educators and students for free.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Safe and private by design</strong></h2>



<p>We take safeguarding seriously, providing visibility of student work at all times, as well as features such as the ability to report a concern. In line with best practices protecting children online, we minimise data capture so that we have just enough to keep students safe.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Future developments&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>As the platform is currently in beta, we’d love to hear what you think of the new classroom management features — please <a href="https://form.raspberrypi.org/f/code-editor-for-education-feedback">send us your feedback</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ll be actively looking to develop new features over the coming months. Such features are set to include an extended set of Python libraries,<strong> </strong>custom instructions that sit alongside starter code projects and teacher-to-student feedback capabilities. All new developments will be informed by ongoing educator feedback.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Coolest Projects in 2024</h2>



<p>This year, 7197 young people across 4678 projects took part in our global Coolest Projects online showcase, with participants from 43 countries. All of these projects were shared in our <a href="https://online.coolestprojects.org/events/cp-2024/gallery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online showcase gallery</a>, and we hosted a <a href="https://youtu.be/1ln4S0jYaok" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live-streamed event</a> celebrating <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/coolest-projects-2024-young-tech-creators-showcase-their-projects-online/">the judges’ favourites</a> watched by over 1000 people.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-500x333.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-88548" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/53720701373_6646826b7b_k.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>At the 2024 in-person Coolest Projects events in Ireland and the UK, 171 young people shared projects. At these events, the young creators presented their projects to other attendees and our team of judges. They also took part in other activities, including a digital escape room.</p>



<p>We wanted to understand how Coolest Projects impacts young people, and so we collected the following data:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>For the online showcase, mentors and tech creators filled in a survey when they completed their project registration, and we ran focus groups with mentors, who are adults that support the tech creators</li>



<li>At the UK and Ireland in-person events, creators completed a survey, other event attendees completed feedback cards, and we also interviewed creators.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Online showcase: Impact on skills and confidence</h2>



<p>In the survey, mentors and young people told us that taking part in the Coolest Projects online showcase had a positive impact:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>91% of young people and 87% of mentors agreed or strongly agreed that taking part in Coolest Projects online inspired them or their team to continue to participate in computing and technology</li>



<li>89% of young people and 86% of mentors agreed or strongly agreed that taking part in Coolest Projects online increased their or their team&#8217;s confidence in coding and digital making</li>
</ul>



<p>Mentors told us that the community built by the online showcase gallery played an important role in making young people want to participate,&nbsp; and improving their confidence. One mentor said that “[being part of the online showcase] motivates them actually to do something innovative and&#8230; [the] global community motivates them to think out of the box.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-500x281.png" alt="The favourites in the web category for Coolest Projects 2024." class="wp-image-87659" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web-900x506.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/06/Web.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>They also reported that the online community inspired young people to solve real-world problems. One mentor said, “the wonderful thing is the kids create so many things which are solutions to world problems.” Others told us that young people feel a great deal of pride that their solutions are available for others to see online and that they get ideas from other projects on how to solve problems. One mentor from India told us about a young person who created a boat to clean rivers and then was inspired to learn to program micro:bit devices, having seen similar projects in the gallery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Focus on ‘growth, not competition’</h2>



<p>The phrase ‘growth, not competition’ came from the mentors in the focus group, and we love this description.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“[With] Coolest Projects… the only agenda is to grow. Grow with the coding, nurture your skills, creativity.” – Focus group attendee.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the focus group, mentors told us they really valued the way the Coolest Projects online showcase allows all young people to participate, including those who were less experienced tech creators. One mentor told us that because everyone’s project is displayed in the gallery the <em>“</em>beauty is that everybody is encouraged individually… regarding the experience. … They can start with very small things. And they have [the] opportunity to upload it on the platform.”</p>



<p>One mentor who supports young people in remote locations in India spoke about the way Coolest Projects offers a level playing field where his students can be included and participate to the same extent as less remote places: “students never feel left behind.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="551" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-500x551.jpg" alt="Three young people working together on a tech project." class="wp-image-82384" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-500x551.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-227x250.jpg 227w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-768x846.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-800x881.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-450x496.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010-900x991.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/12/CPUK19_PHOTO4010.jpg 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>The in-person events also reflected the diversity of young people’s experience of digital making. Of those creators who answered surveys, 35% said it was their first time making this kind of project, while 37% said they had made similar projects before. This mix of experience was also reflected in the interviews, with some young people creating something for the first time and having only started learning coding recently, while others had been developing their projects for a long time. Many creators told us they felt inspired by the opportunity to show their projects to others, regardless of their experience level.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In-person events: Building a community of digital creators</h2>



<p>Attendees at both Coolest Projects UK and Ireland commented on the sense of community and the excitement that was generated by being around other young people. One young person spoke about how much they enjoyed being “surrounded by people who like coding too”. They really valued seeing other creators’ projects and speaking with their peers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-500x333.jpg" alt="The exhibition hall at Coolest Projects Ireland 2023." class="wp-image-84885" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k-900x600.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/09/53103950367_666a2ce548_k.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>The young people we spoke to reflected on the positive impact of this sense of community and belonging. They told us that seeing others’ projects inspired them to develop their ideas and learn new skills. One young person described how the in-person event allowed them to <em>“</em>get inspired and socialise.” A second said, “that’s why I’m here — to get inspired.”</p>



<p>Another clear theme was how much young people valued the opportunity to show their projects to others. This gave them confidence in their own ability to build things. One creator at Coolest Projects UK spoke about the sense of achievement they felt after building something themselves and then being able to present it to others.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="355" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-500x355.jpg" alt="Two young people share a project on their laptop with a judge at Coolest Projects." class="wp-image-88545" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-500x355.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-300x213.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-768x545.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-1536x1090.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-800x567.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-450x319.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10-900x638.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Coolest-Projects_2024_10.jpg 1906w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Young people at both events spoke about their plans for what they wanted to do next, talking about trying new technology such as building games, learning Python, and creating mobile apps. At both events, creators described how they wanted to continue to develop and build on their existing ideas with the possibility of showcasing them again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we want to learn next</h2>



<p>We are continuing to look for ways to improve the Coolest Projects experience for young people and their mentors. As part of this, we are conducting user experience research to understand how we can improve the registration process for the online Coolest Projects showcase.</p>



<p>We were delighted to hear from mentors in this year’s focus group how much they valued the online showcase gallery, and we want to understand the impact of this resource better as part of Coolest Projects 2025. If you want to find out more about Coolest Projects, we highly recommend taking a look at <a href="https://online.coolestprojects.org/events/cp-2024/gallery">the amazing projects made by young people around the world</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Dates for Coolest Projects 2025</h2>



<p>We’re so pleased that so many young people around the world loved taking part in Coolest Projects this year. And we’re very excited that Coolest Projects will be back and bigger than ever before in 2025!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Coolest Projects online showcase is open to any young person up to age 18, based anywhere in the world. <strong>Registration opens 14 January</strong>, and we’ll host a celebratory livestream on <strong>25 June</strong>.</p>

Read the stories of 3 educators who share their thoughts on the curriculum’s application, adaptability, and the impact it’s had on their educational settings. </p>



<p><strong>I’m Freda, and I co-founded a non-profit organisation called Waloyo in South Africa.</strong></p>

<p>Coming from a background of technology consulting, I know the value of computing education. I have a real drive to teach young kids coding so they can get ahead and find jobs in our digital economy.</p>



<p>Our role at Waloyo is to work with non-profit organisations that work with young people and want to expand their services to include computing skills training. Waloyo trains non-profit facilitators, who in turn teach computing skills to youth between the ages of 6 and 18. A unique challenge is that the majority of facilitators we train don&#8217;t have any previous computing experience. The resources we use need to be clear and easy to follow.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>What I really love about The Computing Curriculum resources is the facilitator guides.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Our initial plan was to run the training programmes after school and outside the school curriculum, but we were getting requests from schools to support them too. South Africa doesn’t have a national computing curriculum, so there aren’t many subject specialist teachers. So we looked for curriculum resources from other countries to support our work and that’s how we found The Computing Curriculum.<strong> </strong></p>



<p>In rural Africa where we work, students have low levels of exposure to computers and computing. So whether they are 6 or 18 years old, we usually start with Scratch. The younger kids then continue with Scratch and the older kids move quickly on to Python as they build confidence.</p>

<p>What I really love about The Computing Curriculum resources is the facilitator guides. They fit in well with our process of training NGO facilitators to work directly with the kids. I love the comprehensiveness and flexibility of what your curriculum provides to enable this method of delivery.</p>



<p>So far we&#8217;ve launched 3 programmes in communities in South Africa, impacting around 150 young people, and it’s worked beautifully. It&#8217;s phenomenal to see how excited the kids get when the computer does what they want it to do!</p>

<p>For the past 13 years, I’ve taught in international schools. Two years ago, I decided to retrain in teaching computing. My wife and I are currently teaching in Kazakhstan. I now teach at primary level but still handle some secondary classes. For primary, there&#8217;s significant time pressure, especially with extra lessons for the local language, making it challenging to fit computing into the schedule.</p>



<p>The private schools where I work are starting to implement the UK computer science curriculum. At one of the schools, they have a robotics course which has given rise to a misconception that everything in computing is about robotics! My role, therefore, involves expanding the concept of robotics to include a broader range of computing activities and finding efficient ways to integrate these new materials into the curriculum with minimal effort from the staff. I focus on selecting appropriate units to fit into what the schools are already doing rather than implementing a comprehensive new program.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation’s curriculum resources are valuable because they provide comprehensive lists of programs and ideas that I can adapt for my colleagues. I adapt resources to make them more accessible for primary teachers, simplifying and customising them for ease of use.</p>

<p>Once students understand that computing is a tool for developing skills rather than just passive consumption, they take ownership of their learning which boosts their confidence. Culturally relevant materials are particularly effective, especially in diverse international classrooms. Adapting resources to be culturally relevant and incorporating students&#8217; examples enhances their usefulness and impact. The resources are excellent, but by tailoring them, they can be even more effective, particularly in an international context with diverse nationalities and learning concepts.</p>

<p>As Head of Department, I am responsible for what all the different age groups learn, from year 1 to year 12. We use the Cambridge International (CIE) curriculum, so I was looking for supplementary resources that build from the basics, have a clear progression map, and complement the resources we already had.</p>



<p>With The Computing Curriculum, it is easy to pick out individual lesson resources to use. I love that it doesn’t need a licence and that the students don’t face any problems when they download it to practise at home. I’m covering curriculums for both computing and digital literacy, so I use resources that are relevant to my curriculum maps.</p>

<p>In some schools, their idea of an ICT lesson is getting students to play games, use Word documents, make PowerPoint presentations, and that’s it. But this generation of students love coding and making their own games. So instead of playing the game, we teach them how to develop a game and how to add the characters themselves.</p>



<p>From year 1 to year 2, students take part in a wide range of computing activities and develop a lot of new skills. They find these skills amazing. It makes them feel engaged, excited, and that they are doing something valuable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using The Computing Curriculum </h2>



<p>These educators’ stories show how easy it is to adapt our Computing Curriculum to your unique context, enhancing students&#8217; technical skills and inspiring creativity, critical thinking, and a passion for problem-solving. We look forward to continuing this journey with these and other educators as they transform computing education for their learners.</p>

<p>Today we&#8217;re unveiling a fresh look and feel for Code Club, along with a new ambition to inspire 10 million more young people to get creative with technology over the next decade.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="358" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-500x358.png" alt="Three young tech creators at laptops at a Code Club session." class="wp-image-88516" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-500x358.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-300x215.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-768x550.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-800x573.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-450x322.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img-900x644.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/hero_img.png 1133w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Code Club is a network of free coding clubs where young people learn how to create with technology. Founded in the UK in 2012, it has grown to be a global movement that has already inspired more than 2 million young people to learn how to build their own apps, games, animations, websites, and so much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We know that Code Club works. Independent evaluations have demonstrated that attending a Code Club helps young people develop their programming skills as well as wider life skills like confidence, resilience, and skills in problem-solving and communication. This impact is a result of the positive learning environment created by the teachers and volunteers that run Code Clubs, with young people enjoying the activities and developing skills independently and collaboratively — including young people who sometimes struggle in a formal classroom setting.</p>



<p>Just as important, we know that Code Clubs inspire young people from all backgrounds, including girls and young people from communities that are underrepresented in the technology sector.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s changing and why&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While we are incredibly proud of the impact that Code Club has already achieved, we want to see many more young people benefiting, and that led us to set the ambitious goal to reach 10 million more young people over the next decade.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="400" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-800x400.png" alt="Two mentors and a young tech creator at a laptop at a Code Club session." class="wp-image-88496" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-800x400.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-300x150.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-500x250.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-768x384.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-1536x768.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-450x225.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-900x450.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01.png 1750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<p>To help us figure out how to reach that ambition, we spent a lot of time this year listening to the community as well as engaging with parents, teachers, and young people who aren&#8217;t yet involved in Code Club. All of the changes we&#8217;ve made have been informed by those conversations and are designed to make it easier for educators and volunteers all over the world to set up and run Code Clubs.</p>



<p>The biggest change is that we are making Code Club a more flexible model that can be adapted to reflect your local context and culture to ensure that it is as meaningful as possible for the young people in your community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That means you can host a Code Club in a school or a community venue, like a library or makerspace; you can choose the age range and rhythm of meetings that make sense for your setting; and you can tailor the activities that you offer to the interests and skills of the young people you are serving. In order for the movement to be as inclusive as possible, you don&#8217;t even need to be called &#8216;Code Club&#8217; to be an &#8216;Official Raspberry Pi Foundation Code Club&#8217; and benefit from all the support we offer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To support this change, we have developed a <a href="http://rpf.io/cc-charter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Club Charter</a> that we ask all club leaders and mentors to sign up to. This sets out the principles that are shared by all Code Clubs, along with the commitments that the Raspberry Pi Foundation is making about our support to you.</p>



<p>We have launched a <a href="https://codeclub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new website</a> that makes it easier for you to find the information you need to set up and run your Code Club, along with an updated and simplified <a href="http://rpf.io/leaderguide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">club leader guide</a>. In a few weeks time, we are launching a new online course with guidance on how to run a successful club, and we will be adding to our programme of online community calls, webinars, and training to support a growing community of club leaders and mentors.</p>

<p>One of the most important parts of our support for Code Clubs is the <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">projects</a> that help young people learn how to bring their ideas to life using a wide range of hardware and software. As they are created by experienced educators, based on research, rigorously tested, and translated into dozens of languages, you can have confidence that these projects lead to meaningful and lasting learning outcomes for the young people attending your club. Code Club projects enable young people to learn independently, meaning that mentors don&#8217;t need technical skills.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What this means for CoderDojos&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Alongside Code Club, the Foundation supports CoderDojo, a network of coding clubs that started life in Cork, Ireland in 2011 and merged with the Raspberry Pi Foundation in 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to reduce duplication and make it easier for anyone to set up and run a coding club, we have decided to bring together the resources and support for all club leaders and mentors under one website, which is the new Code Club website.</p>



<p>There is no need for existing CoderDojos to change their name or anything about the way they operate. All registered CoderDojos will be able to manage their club in exactly the same way through the new website, and to access all of the support and resources that we offer to all coding clubs. New clubs will be able to register as CoderDojos.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="569" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-800x569.png" alt="Two young tech creators at a tablet at a Code Club session." class="wp-image-88490" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-800x569.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-300x213.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-500x356.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-768x546.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-450x320.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys-900x640.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/illustration_two_boys.png 1133w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<p>The ethos, experiences, and lessons from the CoderDojo community have been a vital part of the development of the new Code Club. We have worked hard to make sure that all existing CoderDojos feel that their values are reflected in the Charter, and that the guidance and resources we offer address their circumstances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CoderDojos will very much remain part of this community, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation will continue to celebrate and learn from the amazing work of CoderDojos all over the world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Code Club in the age of artificial intelligence&nbsp;</h2>



<p>With AI already transforming so many parts of our lives, it&#8217;s not surprising that some people are starting to ask whether young people even need to learn to code anymore.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="569" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-800x569.png" alt="Three young tech creators at laptops at a Code Club session." class="wp-image-88491" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-800x569.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-300x213.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-500x356.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-768x546.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-450x320.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration-900x640.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/3_girls_illustration.png 1133w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<p>We&#8217;ve got a lot to say on this subject — so watch this space — but the short version is that learning how to create with technology has never been more important. The way that humans give instructions to computers is changing, and Code Club provides a way for young people to experiment with new technologies like AI in a safe environment. Over the next couple of weeks, we&#8217;ll be launching new Code Club projects that support young people to learn about AI technologies, including generative AI, and we&#8217;ll be providing support for club leaders and mentors on the topic too.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thank you and get involved</h2>



<p>I want to end by saying a huge thank you to everyone who has been part of the Code Club journey so far, and particularly to everyone who has worked so hard on this project over the past year — far too many people to name here, but you know who you are. I also want to thank all of the parents, teachers, mentors, and partners who have provided the feedback and ideas that have shaped these changes.</p>

<p>Code Club and CoderDojo were both founded in the early 2010s by individuals who wanted to give more young people the opportunity to be digital creators, not just consumers. From that first Dojo in Cork, Ireland, and the first Code Clubs in London, UK, we&#8217;ve built a global movement that has empowered millions of young people to engage confidently with a world that is being transformed by digital technologies.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s never been a better time to get involved with Code Club, so please take a look and <a href="https://codeclub.org/en/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get in touch</a> if you need any <a href="https://codeclub.org/en/help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help or support</a> to get started.</p>

<p>Since they became publicly available at the end of 2022, generative AI tools have been hotly discussed by educators: what role should these tools for generating human-seeming text, images, and other media play in teaching and learning?</p>



<p>Two years later, the one thing most people agree on is that, like it or not, generative AI is here to stay. And as a computing educator, you probably have your learners and colleagues looking to you for guidance about this technology. We’re sharing how educators like you are approaching generative AI in issue 25 of Hello World, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org//hello-world/issues/25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out today for free</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="262" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-500x262.png" alt="Digital image of a copy of Hello World magazine, issue 25." class="wp-image-88433" style="width:840px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-500x262.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-300x157.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-768x402.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-800x419.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-450x236.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image-900x471.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/9755_HW25_Twitter_Image.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Generative AI and teaching</h2>



<p>Since our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/hello-world-22-ai-education/">‘Teaching and AI’ issue</a> a year ago, educators have been making strides grappling with generative AI’s place in their classroom, and with the potential risks to young people. In this issue, you’ll hear from a wide range of educators who are approaching this technology in different ways. </p>



<p>For example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Laura Ventura from Gwinnett County Public Schools (GCPS) in Georgia, USA shares how the GCPS team has integrated AI throughout their K–12 curriculum</li>



<li>Mark Calleja from our team guides you through using the OCEAN prompt process to reliably get the results you want from an LLM&nbsp;</li>



<li>Kip Glazer, principal at Mountain View High School in California, USA shares a framework for AI implementation aimed at school leaders</li>



<li>Stefan Seegerer, a researcher and educator in Germany, discusses why unplugged activities help us focus on what’s really important in teaching about AI</li>
</ul>



<p>This issue also includes practical solutions to problems that are unique to computer science educators:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Graham Hastings in the UK shares his solution to tricky crocodile clips when working with micro:bits</li>



<li>Riyad Dhuny shares his case study of home-hosting a learning management system with his students in Mauritius</li>
</ul>



<p>And there is lots more for you to discover in issue 25.</p>

</div>



<p>Whether or not you use generative AI as part of your teaching practice, it’s important for you to be aware of AI technologies and how your young people may be interacting with it. In his article <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-were-taking-a-problem-first-approach-to-the-development-of-ai-systems/">“A problem-first approach to the development of AI systems”</a>, Ben Garside from our team affirms that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“A big part of our job as educators is to help young people navigate the changing world and prepare them for their futures, and education has an essential role to play in helping people understand AI technologies so that they can avoid the dangers.</p>



<p>Our approach at the Raspberry Pi Foundation is not to focus purely on the threats and dangers, but to teach young people to be critical users of technologies and not passive consumers. [&#8230;]</p>



<p>Our call to action to educators, carers, and parents is to have conversations with your young people about generative AI. Get to know their opinions on it and how they view its role in their lives, and help them to become critical thinkers when interacting with technology.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Share your thoughts &amp; subscribe to Hello World</h2>

<p>To empower every educator to confidently bring AI into their classroom, we&#8217;ve created a new online training course called <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/education-teacher-training/raspberry-pi-foundation-teach-teens-computing-understanding-ai-for-teachers?utm_source=rpf-blog&amp;utm_medium=partner-marketing&amp;utm_campaign=raspberrypifoundation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Understanding AI for educators’</a> in collaboration with Google DeepMind. By taking this course, you will gain a practical understanding of the crossover between AI tools and education. The course includes a conceptual look at what AI is, how AI systems are built, different approaches to problem-solving with AI, and how to use current AI tools effectively and ethically.</p>

<p>In this post, I will share our approach to designing the course and some of the key considerations behind it — all of which you can apply today to teach your learners about AI systems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Design decisions: Nurturing knowledge and confidence</h2>



<p>We know educators have different levels of confidence with AI tools — we designed this course to help create a level playing field. Our goal is to uplift every educator, regardless of their prior experience, to a point where they feel comfortable discussing AI in the classroom.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-500x333.jpg" alt="Three computer science educators discuss something at a screen." class="wp-image-79983" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/06/RPi2-045-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>AI literacy is key to understanding the implications and opportunities of AI in education. The course provides educators with a solid conceptual foundation, enabling them to ask the right questions and form their own perspectives.</p>



<p>As with all our AI learning materials that are part of <a href="https://experience-ai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI</a>, we’ve used specific design principles for the course:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Choosing language carefully:</strong> We <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-anthropomorphism/">never anthropomorphise AI systems</a>, replacing phrases like “The model understands” with “The model analyses”. We do this to make it clear that AI is just a computer system, not a sentient being with thoughts or feelings.</li>



<li><strong>Accurate terminology</strong>: We avoid using AI as a singular noun, opting instead for the more accurate ‘AI tool’ when talking about applications or ‘AI system’ when talking about underlying component parts.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Ethics:</strong> The social and ethical impacts of AI are not an afterthought but highlighted throughout the learning materials.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Three main takeaways</h2>



<p>The course offers three main takeaways any educator can apply to their teaching about AI systems.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Communicating effectively about AI systems</strong></h3>



<p>Deciding the level of detail to use when talking about AI systems can be difficult — especially if you&#8217;re not very confident about the topic. The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/">SEAME framework</a> offers a solution by breaking down AI into 4 levels: social and ethical, application, model, and engine. Educators can focus on the level most relevant to their lessons and also use the framework as a useful structure for classroom discussions.</p>

<p>You might discuss the impact a particular AI system is having on society, without the need to explain to your learners how the model itself has been trained or tested. Equally, you might focus on a specific machine learning model to look at where the data used to create it came from and consider the effect the data source has on the output.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Problem-solving approaches: Predictive vs. generative AI</h3>



<p>AI applications can be broadly separated into two categories: predictive and generative. These two types of AI model represent two vastly different approaches to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-were-taking-a-problem-first-approach-to-the-development-of-ai-systems/">problem-solving</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People create <strong>predictive AI models</strong> to make predictions about the future. For example, you might create a model to make weather forecasts based on previously recorded weather data, or to recommend new movies to you based on your previous viewing history. In developing predictive AI models, the problem is defined first — then a specific dataset is assembled to help solve it. Therefore, each predictive AI model usually is only useful for a small number of applications.</p>

<p><strong>Generative AI models</strong> are used to generate media (such as text, code, images, or audio). The possible applications of these models are much more varied because people can use media in many different kinds of ways. You might say that the outputs of generative AI models could be used to solve — or at least to partially solve — any number of problems, without these problems needing to be defined before the model is created.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3.&nbsp;Using generative AI tools: The OCEAN process</h3>



<p>Generative AI systems rely on user prompts to generate outputs. The OCEAN process, outlined in the course, offers a simple yet powerful framework for prompting AI tools like Gemini, Stable Diffusion or ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The first three steps of the process help you write better prompts that will result in an output that is as close as possible to what you are looking for, while the last two steps outline how to improve the output:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Clearly state what you want the model to generate</li>



<li><strong>Context</strong>: Provide necessary background information</li>



<li><strong>Examples</strong>: Offer specific examples to fine-tune the model’s output</li>



<li><strong>Assess</strong>: Evaluate the output&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Negotiate</strong>: Refine the prompt to correct any errors in the output</li>
</ol>



<p>The final step in using any generative AI tool should be to closely review or edit the output yourself. These tools will very quickly get you started but you&#8217;ll always have to rely on your own human effort to ensure the quality of your work.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Helping educators to be critical users</h2>



<p>We believe the knowledge and skills our ‘Understanding AI for educators’ course teaches will help any educator determine the right AI tools and concepts to bring into their classroom, regardless of their specialisation. Here&#8217;s what one course participant had to say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;From my inexperienced viewpoint, I kind of viewed AI as a cheat code. I believed that AI in the classroom could possibly be a real detriment to students and eliminate critical thinking skills.<br><br>After learning more about AI [on the course] and getting some hands-on experience with it, my viewpoint has certainly taken a 180-degree turn. AI definitely belongs in schools and in the workplace. It will take time to properly integrate it and know how to ethically use it. Our role as educators is to stay ahead of this trend as opposed to denying AI&#8217;s benefits and falling behind.&#8221; – ‘Understanding AI for educators’ course participant</p>

<p>As discussions of how artificial intelligence (AI) will impact teaching, learning, and assessment proliferate, I was thrilled to be able to add one of my own research projects to the mix. As a research scientist at the Raspberry Pi Foundation, I’ve been working on a pilot research study in collaboration with Jane Waite to explore the topic of program error messages (PEMs).&nbsp;</p>

<p>PEMs can be a significant barrier to learning for novice coders, as they are often confusing and difficult to understand. This can hinder troubleshooting and progress in coding, and lead to frustration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, various teams have been exploring how generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs), can be used to help learners understand PEMs. My research in this area specifically explores secondary teachers’ views of the explanations of PEMs generated by a LLM, as an aid for learning and teaching programming, and I presented some of my results in our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research/seminars">ongoing seminar series</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding program error messages is hard at the start</h2>



<p>I started the seminar by setting the scene and describing the current background of research on novices’ difficulty in using PEMs to fix their code, and the efforts made to date to improve these. The three main points I made were that:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>PEMs are often difficult to decipher, especially by novices, and there’s a whole research area dedicated to identifying ways to improve them.</li>



<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3587102.3588785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Recent studies</a> have employed LLMs as a way of enhancing PEMs. However, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3344429.3372508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">evidence</a> on what makes an ‘effective’ PEM for learning is limited, variable, and contradictory.</li>



<li>There is limited research in the context of K–12 programming education, as well as research conducted in collaboration with teachers to better understand the practical and pedagogical implications of integrating LLMs into the classroom more generally.</li>
</ol>



<p>My pilot study aims to fill this gap directly, by reporting K–12 teachers’ views of the potential use of LLM-generated explanations of PEMs in the classroom, and how their views fit into the wider theoretical paradigm of feedback literacy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What did the teachers say?</h2>



<p>To conduct the study, I interviewed eight expert secondary computing educators. The interviews were semi-structured activity-based interviews, where the educators got to experiment with a prototype version of the Foundation’s <a href="https://editor.raspberrypi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly available Code Editor</a>. This version of the Code Editor was adapted to generate LLM explanations when the question mark next to the standard error message is clicked (see Figure 1 for an example of a LLM-generated explanation). The Code Editor version called the OpenAI GPT-3.5 interface to generate explanations based on the following prompt: “You are a teacher talking to a 12-year-old child. Explain the error {error} in the following Python code: {code}”.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="275" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-500x275.png" alt="The Foundation’s Python Code Editor with LLM feedback prototype." class="wp-image-88178" style="width:633px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-500x275.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-300x165.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-768x422.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-800x440.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-450x247.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-900x495.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image.png 1115w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1: The Foundation&#8217;s Code Editor with LLM feedback prototype.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Fifteen themes were derived from the educators’ responses and these were split into five groups (Figure 2). Overall, the educators’ views of the LLM feedback were that, for the most part, a sensible explanation of the error messages was produced. However, all educators experienced at least one example of invalid content (LLM &#8220;hallucination&#8221;). Also, despite not being explicitly requested in the LLM prompt, a possible code solution was always included in the explanation.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="357" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-1-500x357.png" alt="Themes and groups derived from teachers’ responses." class="wp-image-88179" style="width:643px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-1-500x357.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-1-300x214.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-1-768x548.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-1-800x571.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-1-450x321.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png 822w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 2: Themes and groups derived from teachers’ responses.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Matching the themes to PEM guidelines</h2>



<p>Next, I investigated how the teachers’ views correlated to the research conducted to date on enhanced PEMs. I used the guidelines proposed by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3344429.3372508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brett Becker and colleagues</a>, which consolidate a lot of the research done in this area into ten design guidelines. The guidelines offer best practices on how to enhance PEMs based on cognitive science and educational theory empirical research. For example, they outline that enhanced PEMs should provide scaffolding for the user, increase readability, reduce cognitive load, use a positive tone, and provide context to the error.</p>



<p>Out of the 15 themes identified in my study, 10 of these correlated closely to the guidelines. However, the 10 themes that correlated well were, for the most part, the themes related to the content of the explanations, presentation, and validity (Figure 3). On the other hand, the themes concerning the teaching and learning process did not fit as well to the guidelines.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="288" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-2-500x288.png" alt="Correlation between teachers’ responses and enhanced PEM design guidelines." class="wp-image-88180" style="width:640px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-2-500x288.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-2-300x173.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-2-768x443.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-2-1536x885.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-2-800x461.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-2-450x259.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-2-900x519.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 3: Correlation between teachers’ responses and enhanced PEM design guidelines.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Does feedback literacy theory fit better?</h2>



<p>However, when I looked at feedback literacy theory, I was able to correlate all fifteen themes — the theory fits.</p>



<p>Feedback literacy theory positions the feedback process (which includes explanations) as a social interaction, and accounts for the actors involved in the interaction — the student and the teacher — as well as the relationships between the student, the teacher, and the feedback. We can explain feedback literacy theory using three constructs: feedback types, student feedback literacy, and teacher feedback literacy (Figure 4).&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="276" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-3-500x276.png" alt="Feedback literacy at the intersection between feedback types, student feedback literacy, and teacher feedback literacy." class="wp-image-88181" style="width:662px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-3-500x276.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-3-300x166.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-3-768x424.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-3-1536x849.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-3-800x442.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-3-450x249.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-3-900x497.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/image-3.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 4: Feedback literacy at the intersection between feedback types, student feedback literacy, and teacher feedback literacy.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>From the feedback literacy perspective, feedback can be grouped into four types: telling, guiding, developing understanding, and opening up new perspectives. The feedback type depends on the role of the student and teacher when engaging with the feedback (Figure 5).&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the student perspective, the competencies and dispositions students need in order to use feedback effectively can be stated as: appreciating the feedback processes, making judgements, taking action, and managing affect. Finally, from a teacher perspective, teachers apply their feedback literacy skills across three dimensions: design, relational, and pragmatic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In short, according to feedback literacy theory, effective feedback processes entail well-designed feedback with a clear pedagogical purpose, as well as the competencies students and teachers need in order to make sense of the feedback and use it effectively.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="330" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2019/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_028-500x330.jpg" alt="A computing educator with three students at laptops in a classroom." class="wp-image-50374" style="width:648px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2019/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_028-500x330.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2019/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_028-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2019/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_028-768x507.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2019/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_028-1636x1080.jpg 1636w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>This theory therefore provided a promising lens for analysing the educators&#8217; perspectives in my study. When the educators’ views were correlated to feedback literacy theory, I found that:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Educators prefer the LLM explanations to fulfil a <strong>guiding</strong> and <strong>developing understanding</strong> role, rather than <strong>telling</strong>. For example, educators prefer to either remove or delay the code solution from the explanation, and they like the explanations to include keywords based on concepts they are teaching in the classroom to guide and develop students’ understanding rather than tell.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Related to students’ feedback literacy, educators talked about the ways in which the LLM explanations help or hinder students to <strong>make judgements</strong> and <strong>action the feedback</strong> in the explanations. For example, they talked about how detailed, jargon-free explanations can help students make judgments about the feedback, but invalid explanations can hinder this process. Therefore, teachers talked about the need for ways to manage such invalid instances. However, for the most part, the educators didn’t talk about eradicating them altogether. They talked about ways of flagging them, using them as counter-examples, and having visibility of them to be able to address them with students.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Finally, from a teacher feedback literacy perspective, educators discussed the need for professional development to manage feedback processes inclusive of LLM feedback (<strong>design</strong>) and address issues resulting from reduced opportunities to interact with students (<strong>relational </strong>and<strong> pragmatic</strong>). For example, if using LLM explanations results in a reduction in the time teachers spend helping students debug syntax errors from a pragmatic time-saving perspective, then what does that mean for the relationship they have with their students?&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion from the study</h2>



<p>By correlating educators’ views to feedback literacy theory as well as enhanced PEM guidelines, we can take a broader perspective on how LLMs might not only shape the content of the explanations, but the whole social interaction around giving and receiving feedback. Investigating ways of supporting students and teachers to practise their feedback literacy skills matters just as much, if not more, than focusing on the content of PEM explanations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This study was a first-step exploration of eight educators’ views on the potential impact of using LLM explanations of PEMs in the classroom. Exactly what the findings of this study mean for classroom practice remains to be investigated, and we also need to examine students’ views on the feedback and its impact on their journey of learning to program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I&#8217;ve enjoyed actually learning about what AI is and how it works, because before I thought it was just a scary computer that thinks like a human,” a student learning with Experience AI at King Edward’s School, Bath, UK, told us. </p>



<p>This is the essence of what we aim to do with our <a href="http://experience-ai.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI lessons</a>, which demystify artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Through Experience AI, teachers worldwide are empowered to confidently deliver engaging lessons with a suite of resources that inspire and educate 11- to 14-year-olds about AI and the role it could play in their lives.</p>



<p>“I learned new things and it changed my mindset that AI is going to take over the world.” – <strong>Student, Malaysia</strong></p>

<p>Developed by us with <a href="https://deepmind.google/impact/?_gl=1*j0ixqt*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTA2MzY3NTU3Ni4xNzIyMzM0NDQw*_ga_LS8HVHCNQ0*MTcyMjMzNDQzOS4xLjAuMTcyMjMzNDQzOS4wLjAuMA..">Google DeepMind</a>, our first set of Experience AI lesson resources was aimed at a UK audience and launched in April 2023. Next we released tailored versions of the resources for 5 other countries, working in close partnership with organisations in Malaysia, Kenya, Canada, Romania, and India. Thanks to new funding from <a href="http://google.org">Google.org</a>, we&#8217;re now expanding Experience AI for 16 more countries and creating new resources on AI safety, with the aim of providing leading-edge AI education for more than 2 million young people across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. </p>



<p>In this blog post, you&#8217;ll hear directly from students and teachers about the impact the Experience AI lessons have had so far.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Case study:  Experience AI in Malaysia</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.pscpen.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwnqK1BhBvEiwAi7o0XwOaDBaQ9Qc6Xj6qE8u3XFBGllunpeKpdneHSshtZQpoVtZH_X9tkBoCHR8QAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Penang Science Cluster</a> in Malaysia is among the first organisations we&#8217;ve partnered with for Experience AI. Speaking to Malaysian students learning with Experience AI, we found that the lessons were often very different from what they had expected. </p>

<p>“I actually thought it was going to be about boring lectures and not much about AI but more on coding, but we actually got to do a lot of hands-on activities, which are pretty fun. I thought AI was just about robots, but after joining this, I found it could be made into chatbots or could be made into personal helpers.” – <strong>Student, Malaysia</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Actually, I thought AI was mostly related to robots, so I was expecting to learn more about robots when I came to this programme. It widened my perception on AI.” &#8211; <strong>Student, Malaysia.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Malaysian government actively promotes AI literacy among its citizens, and working with local education authorities, Penang Science Cluster is using Experience AI to train teachers and equip thousands of young people in the state of Penang with the understanding and skills to use AI effectively. </p>



<p>“We envision a future where AI education is as fundamental as mathematics education, providing students with the tools they need to thrive in an AI-driven world”, says Aimy Lee, Chief Operating Officer at Penang Science Cluster. “The journey of AI exploration in Malaysia has only just begun, and we’re thrilled to play a part in shaping its trajectory.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Giving non-specialist teachers the confidence to introduce AI to students</h2>



<p>Experience AI provides <a href="https://experience-ai.org/en/">lesson plans, classroom resources, worksheets, hands-on activities, and videos</a> to help teachers introduce a wide range of AI applications and help students understand how they work. The resources are <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/">based on research</a>, and because we adapt them <a href="https://experience-ai.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to each partner&#8217;s country</a>, they are culturally relevant and relatable for students. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/a-teachers-guide-to-teaching-experience-ai-lessons/">Any teacher</a> can use the resources in their classroom, whether or not they have a background in computing education. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Our Key Stage 3 Computing students now feel immensely more knowledgeable about the importance and place that AI has in their wider lives. These lessons and activities are engaging and accessible to students and educators alike, whatever their specialism may be.” &#8211; <strong>Dave Cross,  North Liverpool Academy, UK</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>“The feedback we’ve received from both teachers and learners has been overwhelmingly positive. They consistently rave about how accessible, fun, and hands-on these resources are. What’s more, the materials are so comprehensive that even non-specialists can deliver them with confidence.” – <strong>Storm Rae, The National Museum of Computing, UK</strong></p>

<p><br>“[The lessons] go above and beyond to ensure that students not only grasp the material but also develop a genuine interest and enthusiasm for the subject.” – <strong>Teacher, Changamwe Junior School, Mombasa, Kenya</strong></p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sparking debates on bias and the limitations of AI</h2>



<p>When learners gain an understanding of how AI works, it gives them the confidence to discuss areas where the technology doesn&#8217;t work well or its output is incorrect. These classroom debates deepen and consolidate their knowledge, and help them to use AI more critically.</p>



<p>“Students enjoyed the practical aspects of the lessons, like categorising apples and tomatoes. They found it intriguing how AI could sometimes misidentify objects, sparking discussions on its limitations. They also expressed concerns about AI bias, which these lessons helped raise awareness about. I didn&#8217;t always have all the answers, but it was clear they were curious about AI&#8217;s implications for their future.” – <strong>Tracey Mayhead, Arthur Mellows Village College, Peterborough, UK</strong></p>

<p>“The lessons that we trialled took some of the ‘magic’ out of AI and started to give the students an understanding that AI is only as good as the data that is used to build it.” – <strong>Jacky Green, Waldegrave School, UK&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“I have enjoyed learning about how AI is actually programmed, rather than just hearing about how impactful and great it could be.” – <strong>Student, King Edward’s School, Bath, UK&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“It has changed my outlook on AI because now I&#8217;ve realised how much AI actually needs human intelligence to be able to do anything.” – <strong>Student, Arthur Mellows Village College, Peterborough, UK&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>“I didn’t really know what I wanted to do before this but now knowing more about AI, I probably would consider a future career in AI as I find it really interesting and I really liked learning about it.” – <strong>Student, Arthur Mellows Village College, Peterborough, UK&nbsp;</strong></p>
