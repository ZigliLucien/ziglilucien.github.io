<p>You will be among the very first educators to see some of our first test activities for teacher training to build data science concepts, and your contributions will feed into our future work. Sign up by 20 June to take part.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Data science: What do we need to teach school-age learners?</strong></h2>



<p>Current artificial intelligence (AI) methods, especially machine learning (ML), rely heavily on data. While young people learn mathematics, and some statistics, at school, data science concepts are not commonly taught.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16.jpg" alt="Teachers at a workshop." class="wp-image-90386" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>To complement our work on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/teach/ai-education" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI literacy</a>, we have been investigating what data science teaching resources and education research are currently available.</p>



<p>Our goals for this work are:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>To figure out what data science concepts may need to be taught in schools, initially with a focus on key stage 5</li>



<li>To develop related teacher professional development and classroom resources</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Join us to discuss data science education</strong></h2>



<p>If you are interested in <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research/seminars/previous/teaching-about-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data science education</a> for young people, and maybe even have experience of teaching it to learners aged 16 to 18 in your school (in any subject, including computer science, social sciences, mathematics, statistics, and ethics), please join our free workshop on Thursday 10 July in our office in Cambridge. We are able to reimburse some travel expenses.</p>



<p>At the workshop:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We would love to hear about your experience of teaching any elements of data science</li>



<li>We will share some exploratory concept building activities with you and discuss them together</li>
</ul>



<p>You&#8217;ll be the first group of working teachers we will share these activities with — your feedback will be invaluable, and you&#8217;ll have the chance to shape our work going forward.</p>



<p>If you are interested, please <a href="https://form.raspberrypi.org/4874025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fill in this form</a> by Friday 20 June:</p>

<p>Today we&#8217;re publishing a position paper setting out five arguments for why we think that kids still need to learn to code in the age of artificial intelligence.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-500x333.png" alt="A whimsical cartoon of someone struggling with vibe coding at a desktop computer and a second person with a superhero cape and a t-shirt saying 'programmer' coming to their rescue." class="wp-image-90359" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-500x333.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-300x200.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-768x512.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-800x533.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-450x300.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-900x600.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode.png 983w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Generated using ChatGPT.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Just like every wave of technological innovation that has come before, the advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are raising profound questions about the future of human work. History teaches us that technology has the potential to both automate and augment human effort, destroying some jobs and creating new ones. The only thing we know for sure is that it is impossible to predict the precise nature and pace of the changes that are coming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the fastest-moving applications of generative AI technologies are the systems that can generate code. What started as the coding equivalent of autocomplete has quickly progressed to tools that can generate increasingly complex code from natural language prompts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has given birth to the notion of &#8220;vibe-coding&#8221; and led some commentators to predict the end of the software development industry as we know it. It shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise then that there is a vigorous debate about whether kids still need to learn to code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the position paper we put forward five arguments for why we think the answer is an unequivocal yes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/about/Why-kids-still-need-to-learn-to-code-in-the-age-of-AI-2025-Raspberry-Pi-Foundation-position-paper.pdf">Download the paper</a></div>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">We need humans who are skilled programmers&nbsp;</h2>



<p>First, we argue that even in a world where AI can generate code, we need skilled human programmers who can think critically, solve problems, and make ethical decisions. The large language models that underpin these tools are probabilistic systems designed to provide statistically acceptable outputs and, as any skilled software engineer will tell you, simply writing more code faster isn&#8217;t necessarily a good thing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning to code is an essential part of learning to program</h2>



<p>Learning to code is the most effective way we know for a young person to develop the mental models and fluency to become a skilled human programmer. The hard cognitive work of reading, modifying, writing, explaining, and testing code is precisely how young people develop a deep understanding of programming and computational thinking.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning to code will open up even more opportunities in the age of AI&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While there&#8217;s no doubt that AI is going to reshape the labour market, the evidence from history suggests that it will increase the reach of programming and computational approaches across the economy and into new domains, creating demand for humans who are skilled programmers. We also argue that coding is no longer just for software engineers, it&#8217;s becoming a core skill that enables people to work effectively and think critically in a world shaped by intelligent machines. From healthcare to agriculture, we are already seeing demand for people who can combine programming with domain-specific skills and craft knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Coding is a literacy that helps young people have agency in a digital world</h2>



<p>Alongside the arguments for coding as a route to opening up economic opportunities, we argue that coding and programming gives young people a way to express themselves, to learn, and to make sense of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And perhaps most importantly, that learning to code is about power. Providing young people with a solid grounding in computational literacy, developed through coding, helps ensure that they have agency. Without it, they risk being manipulated by systems they don&#8217;t understand. As Rushkoff said: &#8220;Program, or be programmed&#8221;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The kids who learn to code will shape the future</h2>



<p>Finally, we argue that the power to create with technology is already concentrated in too small and homogenous a group of people. We need to open up the opportunity to learn to code to all young people because it will help us mobilise the full potential of human talent, will lead to more inclusive and effective digital solutions to the big global challenges we face, and will help ensure that everyone can share in the societal and economic benefits of technological progress.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The work we need to do&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We end <a href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/about/Why-kids-still-need-to-learn-to-code-in-the-age-of-AI-2025-Raspberry-Pi-Foundation-position-paper.pdf">the paper</a> with a call to action for all of us working in education. We need to challenge the false narrative that AI is removing the need for kids to learn to code, and redouble our efforts to ensure that all young people are equipped to take advantage of the opportunities in a world where AI is ubiquitous.</p>

<p>Bradford was buzzing with excitement this May as over 170 young digital makers from across the UK gathered for Coolest Projects UK 2025 at the Life Centre to celebrate the amazing things young people create with technology. Run by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and hosted by BBC science presenter Greg Foot, the free, in-person event brought together budding creators, families, mentors, and even a few troops of Scouts for a fun-filled day.</p>



<p>From AI tools and advanced programming to Scratch games and hardware builds, the showcase featured an incredible range of projects from 113 Coolest Projects participants and 58 scouts. Every young person received thoughtful feedback from industry professionals, the chance to try hands-on coding challenges, and the thrill of sharing what they built with a welcoming crowd and other creators.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A day of discovery and digital making</h2>



<p>Coolest Projects UK 2025 wasn’t just about showcasing finished products; it celebrated every part of the creative journey. Many creators shared works-in-progress or prototypes, sparking conversations around design, problem-solving, and learning through code.</p>



<p>One of the day’s highlights was an interactive escape room designed just for the event, giving attendees a chance to flex their logical thinking and collaboration skills. And for 58 visiting Scouts, the day was a chance to earn their Digital Maker Badge and share their creations with the showcase participants.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A platform for everyone</strong></h2>



<p>Many of this year’s participants came from local Code Clubs, CoderDojos, and schools across the UK. Others had worked independently to bring their ideas to life. The event encouraged collaboration and connection, with creators exchanging feedback, learning from each other, and celebrating shared interests.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, young people from Bradford also had the chance to take part in hands-on workshops. Held at the National Science and Media Museum, they were guided on getting started with digital making and developing their own project ideas for the showcase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Featured projects</strong></h2>



<p>Here are a few of the projects that were showcased on the day. Each one demonstrates the power of digital tools and the fun and creativity that young people bring to their Coolest Projects journeys. Here’s what the creators had to say about their work, what inspired them, and their experiences of the day:</p>



<p><strong>Arlo | MUST. EAT. DONUTS., AI</strong></p>



<p>Arlo’s interactive game featured AI models that used face and mouth tracking to make the main character, called Chompy, mirror the movements of the player. Arlo&#8217;s game was inspired by a session at his Code Club. He came across a video sensing motion plug-in and realised he could make a game that used the player’s head as the controller.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It is a fun and silly game for all to play. I also created the artwork myself in my own style, as drawing is another one of my passions, alongside coding. I would love to come back next year, maybe in a different category. I wanted to enter because I got the chance to share my coding and drawing skills, and I was excited to think others may play a game I created.”</p>

<p><strong>Felicia and Francesca | The Silent Forest, Scratch</strong></p>



<p>Felicia and Francesca created a top-down, Zelda-style RPG in Scratch, where the player explores a pixel world and interacts with characters and objects. Instead of using the keyboard, the game is controlled with a Micro:bit. Felicia shared with us why they wanted to showcase the game at Coolest Projects.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I went to Coolest Projects UK because I love making things with Scratch and wanted to show my game to other people. It was a fun way to share what I built, see what other kids made, and learn new ideas. I wanted to challenge myself and be part of something really cool!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Eesa, Yahya and Yusha | Let&#8217;s Speak Arabic!, Scratch</strong></p>



<p>Let’s Speak Arabic is an interactive program designed to help people learn conversational Arabic. Eesa, Yahya, and Yusha are home educated and study a book called <em>Al Arabiyyah Bayna Yadayk</em> together. This inspired them to think about fun ways to upgrade their study, and the idea for gamifying their learning through Scratch was born. The team shared a little about their experience:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The event was awesome. Actually, it was even better than we imagined! We loved meeting people from all over the country, really enjoyed playing other people’s games, and got lots of ideas for what we could code in the future. And, our parents were so proud we got judge’s favourite!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Jay | J Bot, Hardware</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/celebrating-the-community-jay/">Jay is a long-time friend</a> of the Foundation and has been taking part in Coolest Projects online and in person for the past few years. He wowed again this year with his life-sized J Bot and shared with us why he thinks Coolest Projects is such an important event for the young creator community.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I know it might seem a bit intimidating to come and showcase in front of all these people, but I feel more and more people should try and get involved [in Coolest Projects] because it’s a really good community of people. And they are really supportive as well. So I would just say, give it a go. Don’t be nervous because people are here to help you along the way.”</p>

<p>From smart devices to workplace tools, AI is becoming part of everyday life and a major part of how people are thinking about the future — raising big questions about access, skills, and readiness.</p>



<p>As governments around the world create AI strategies for the decade ahead, many are seeing an urgent need to address the large gap between how AI tools are already <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1161826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impacting jobs</a> and people’s lives, and making sure young people have the chance to gain the skills and knowledge to keep up with this rapid pace of technological change. This gap is larger still when it comes to opportunities for educationally underserved communities.</p>

<p>That’s why we’re excited to share how <a href="http://rpf.io/expai-gp-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI</a>, our AI literacy programme, is helping organisations around the world create these much-needed opportunities for young people.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The value of a global network</strong></h2>



<p>Experience AI was co-developed in 2022 by us and industry experts at Google DeepMind with a clear mission: to equip teachers with free, accessible, easy-to-use classroom resources that build AI literacy from the ground up. The programme offers a suite of materials to help students understand real-world applications of AI, the basics of machine learning, and the ethical considerations around these technologies.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1479" height="1600" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6.jpeg" alt="A picture of Philip Colligan delivering a talk." class="wp-image-90283" style="width:580px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6.jpeg 1479w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-231x250.jpeg 231w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-500x541.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-768x831.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-1420x1536.jpeg 1420w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-800x865.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-450x487.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-900x974.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1479px) 100vw, 1479px" /></figure></div>


<p>In 2023, we <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-canada-kenya-romania/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started building an international Experience AI network</a> by collaborating with a group of our existing educational partners. We saw a huge amount of interest and received very positive feedback, and through our partnerships we reached an estimated one million young people. In late 2024, with support from <a href="http://google.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google.org</a>, we tripled the size of our <a href="http://rpf.io/expai-gppage-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI partner network</a> to 21, with new organisations joining from across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In this way, we aim to reach an <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-expands-to-reach-over-2-million-students/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">additional 2.3 million young people by December 2026</a>, helping them to gain the knowledge and skills to confidently engage with AI in an ever-changing world.</p>



<p>Each partner in the Experience AI network is a unique educational organisation looking to create lasting social change. Through their local knowledge and networks, we can present Experience AI to educators and students in a way that is engaging and relevant for local communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Partners help us to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/localising-ai-education-adapting-experience-ai-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adapt and translate our resources</a>, all while making sure that the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/">core</a><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/explaining-ai-terms-young-people-educators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> pedagogy</a> and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-anthropomorphism/">design</a><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-were-taking-a-problem-first-approach-to-the-development-of-ai-systems/"> principles</a> of Experience AI are preserved. Just as importantly, these organisations <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/impact-of-experience-ai-in-kenya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">train thousands of teachers</a> on how to use the materials, providing educators with free support. With their work, they reach communities that otherwise may have never had the opportunity to learn about AI.</p>



<p>We asked some of our partners to share their insights on the impact Experience AI is having on the teachers and young people in their communities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building communities</strong></h2>



<p>The Latvian Safer Internet Centre (LSIC), an initiative of our partner, the <a href="https://www.lia.lv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Latvian Internet Association</a> (LIA), is dedicated to helping young people protect themselves online, and to preparing them for a fast-changing digital economy. As an Experience AI partner, they aim to train 850 teachers and support 43,000 students to build a strong foundation in AI literacy through the programme.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We hope to spark a cultural shift in how AI is […] taught in Latvian schools. Our goal is for AI literacy to become a natural part of digital competence education, not an optional extra.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based in Riga, the team is travelling to 18 different regions across Latvia to bring in-person professional development to teachers, including those in rural communities far from major cities. By meeting teachers where they are, the LIA are creating invaluable networks for learning and support between communities. Through hands-on training, they are also supporting teachers to bring Experience AI into their own classroom, creating examples which are suited for their learners.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We chose an in-person training model because it fosters a more collaborative and engaging environment, especially for teachers who are new to AI. Many educators, particularly those who are less confident with digital tools, benefit from direct interaction, real-time discussions, and the chance to ask questions in a supportive setting.” </p>
</blockquote>



<p>As an Experience AI partner, the Latvian Internet Association is not just delivering content but working to strengthen digital competency across the country and ensure that no teacher or student is left behind in Latvia’s AI journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One teacher shares: “The classroom training was truly valuable: it gave us the chance to exchange ideas and reflect on our diverse experiences. Hearing different perspectives was enriching, and I’m glad we’re shaping the future of our schools together.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>“AI is for everyone”</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.edcamp.ua/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EdCamp Ukraine</a>’s mission is to unite educators and help them to grow. Operating from their main base in Kharkiv, near the Eastern border and the frontline of the ongoing war in Ukraine, they see AI as both a tool for new technological breakthroughs and as something that can help build a fairer, more efficient, and resilient society.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We firmly believe AI should not only be an object of study — it must become a tool for amplifying human potential. AI should also not be a privilege, but a resource for everyone. We believe the Experience AI programme can truly transform education from the bottom up.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within their community of 50,000 teachers, EdCamp Ukraine ensures that every educator, regardless of their living conditions or where they work, can access high-quality, relevant, and accessible support. For the organisation, the ongoing situation in Ukraine means being flexible with planning, preparing for a range of different outcomes, and being ready to pivot delivery to different locations or to an online setting when needed. These same considerations apply to EdCamp Ukraine&#8217;s teacher community, who need to be ready to adapt their lessons for any scenario.</p>

<p>This year, the team piloted Experience AI through their community of trainers, who, when they’re not training, are busy teaching in the classroom. Teacher Yuliia shared how her students valued the opportunity to be creators, rather than just users of technology:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“One student, who is an active AI user, kept silent during the lesson. I thought he wasn’t interested, but during the reflection he shared a lot of positive feedback and expressed his gratitude. Other students said it was important that they weren’t just told about AI — they were using it, creating images, and working with apps.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A turning tide</h2>



<p>2024 was the year the tide turned against smartphones. Across the world, parents, teachers, and governments highlighted the risks of excessive phone use among young people. In the UK, the ‘Smartphone Free Childhood’ movement emerged, quickly growing to 100,000 members who advocate for keeping smartphones away from children due to concerns about addiction, harmful content, and mental health. Jonathan Haidt’s global bestseller <em>The Anxious Generation</em> has further fuelled the movement, linking smartphone use to adolescent mental health issues and recommending phonefree schools. Meanwhile, countries including England, France, and Finland have urged schools to adopt strict phone bans, hoping to reduce classroom distractions and enhance student safety.</p>

<p>Despite widespread support, academic research on phone bans remains limited and inconclusive. Given this situation, computing educators are uniquely positioned to offer an alternative approach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Evaluating evidence on phone bans&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The rapid spread of school smartphone bans is a straightforward response to complex issues around personal technology use in education. Teachers and parents frequently view phones as inherently disruptive, a perspective supported by studies that show phones can impair students’ focus and engagement in lessons. Concerns about cyberbullying and addiction contribute to this view, with many educators seeing bans as a practical solution to mitigate risks. Surveys in England reveal that nearly half of all secondary schools now enforce all-day bans. This trend was supported by teachers participating in my master’s degree research, who see these policies as necessary to reduce distractions and maintain control in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Calls for outright bans may oversimplify the conversation.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yet calls for outright bans may oversimplify the conversation, limiting opportunities to examine both the benefits and the risks of smartphone use in schools. <a href="http://helloworld.cc/smartphone-evidence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evidence on the impact of phone restrictions is mixed</a>: while some studies suggest restrictions may benefit learning, especially for students who struggle the most, others indicate no significant impact on academic outcomes. Additionally, recent findings show that cyberbullying is not directly linked to time spent online, with traditional bullying still more prevalent in schools. Even the narrative around smartphone addiction is contested, with some researchers suggesting that concerns about addiction may be overstated. And <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/teaching-digital-literacy-without-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some schools do not have access to digital devices</a> for learners and then smartphones may play a crucial role in teaching and learning digital literacy skills.</p>

<p>As the debate over smartphone bans continues, educators have an opportunity to move beyond restrictions and engage students in understanding the technology that shapes their lives. This is where computing educators can really make a difference. How can they guide students to understand why technology is designed to capture attention and what lies behind these design choices?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding and questioning the design of technology&nbsp;</h2>



<p>School smartphone bans can feel like a hopeless act that suggests phones and social media are inherently incompatible with learning and student well-being. This approach assumes the only solution is to remove them, rather than considering how these technologies might be better managed or reimagined to support young people. What if, instead of banning phones, educators worked with students to explore why they are so captivating and how they could be designed differently? Computing educators can lead this exploration. With digital literacy as part of their curriculum, computing teachers can help students question the motives behind their devices, fostering a critical understanding of the forces shaping their digital world.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;With digital literacy as part of their curriculum, computing teachers can help students question the motives behind their devices, fostering a critical understanding of the forces shaping their digital world.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the heart of how social media platforms are designed is their business models. Tech companies rely on features such as notifications, autoplay, and infinite scrolling to maximise user engagement and revenue. This is part of what the writer Shoshana Zuboff calls <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=56791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“surveillance capitalism”</a>, where companies gather vast amounts of behavioural data by keeping users engaged on their platforms for as long as possible.</p>



<p>In the classroom, educators can open discussions with students on the motives behind technology design, exploring questions such as why platforms want users to stay engaged, and what data they are collecting. Activities might include analysing popular apps to identify which features encourage prolonged use, or debating how social media could be designed to prioritise user wellbeing. By critically examining these design choices, students can better understand the forces driving their digital interactions and consider ways in which technology could be reimagined to serve them, rather than just profiting from them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Collaborative policymaking&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once young people understand why phones and social media are designed the way they are, educators can work with students to create phone policies that reflect shared values and goals. This collaborative approach encourages students to take ownership of their technology use, and computing teachers, drawing on their knowledge of technology design and digital literacy, are ideally positioned to facilitate these discussions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.renniecenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-01/2019%20Condition%20of%20Education%20Action%20Guide_Student%20Voice.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research suggests that policies developed with student input are more effective</a>, as they foster responsibility and engagement. By involving students in policymaking, educators can encourage them to consider how phones could support rather than hinder learning. For example, students might agree that phones should stay off during certain times, or in certain spaces, but that they might be useful in other scenarios where access benefits learning. This kind of flexibility ensures that phones are used thoughtfully, allowing for both practical boundaries and opportunities for educational use.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Critical skills for navigating the digital world</h2>



<p>As debate around smartphone use in schools continues, academic research remains inconclusive on the effectiveness of phone bans. This uncertainty presents computing educators with an opportunity to move beyond restrictive policies and foster deeper understanding. By guiding students to explore why phones and social media are designed to capture attention, we can help to equip them with the critical skills needed to navigate their digital world thoughtfully. Involving students in crafting flexible, meaningful phone policies reinforces this understanding, giving them a sense of agency in shaping technology’s role in their lives.</p>

<p>Computing educators are uniquely positioned to empower students, not just as users, but as active challengers of technology design norms. Embracing a collaborative approach allows computing educators to inspire students to envision a future where technology genuinely serves their growth and their learning, rather than commercial interests.</p>

<p>It must be frustrating for teachers in this situation to see marketing campaigns from companies showing how their curriculum offering will use the very latest in robotics, AI, or media production, when the teachers&#8217; reality is that they don’t have anything like the means or resources to deliver this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately there are approaches that can help. Below I outline some of the ways we are working with teachers to make the teaching of computing and digital literacy less resource-heavy and more accessible and equitable.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Schools in Kenya: A case study&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Our work with Kenyan teachers has brought the access issue into sharp focus for us. We are currently developing free resources to deliver the Kenyan curriculum to schools in Mombasa and the Frontier Counties. There are big contrasts both between and within these two areas of the country. Some schools are well equipped with digital technology, while others have very little access to any computing devices; in these schools, smartphones play a crucial role.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976.jpg" alt="Students code in Scratch on a computer." class="wp-image-90231" style="width:762px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>With that in mind, the curriculum resources we develop suggest class activities that make the most of limited devices, such as the use of projected demonstrations. We also provide a step-by-step guide to computing tasks, with screenshots, to guide learners through the tasks conceptually. This ensures learners understand the process and can apply their new knowledge once they gain access to the necessary devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We make these resources available online and in downloadable documents. This means the resources can be taken offline and taught in places without stable internet connection. We are also careful to limit file sizes, to make downloads more accessible. Wherever possible, our resources are device-agnostic, so that they can be accessed on a wide range of devices, including personal devices such as mobile phones.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="668" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925.jpg" alt="A close-up shot shows a person's hand holding a small red LED light, which is illuminated. " class="wp-image-90232" style="width:762px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925-450x301.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925-900x601.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>As well as tailoring curriculum resources, we have also adapted our teacher training to make it more accessible for people with less experience of using computing devices. For example, during a recent project coaching community trainers in Mombasa, we emphasised activities that improve digital skills on various devices. This meant that when passing the training on to other teachers, the community trainers had a broader set of skills across a wider range of devices.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Unplugged activities</h2>



<p>Even computing-specific concepts such as a programming construct can, to a degree, be taught with very limited access to devices. Unplugged activities, where no digital technology is required, can be used to introduce fundamental concepts such as sequencing and repetition.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="668" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755.jpg" alt="A group of men holding a string." class="wp-image-90234" style="width:762px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755-450x301.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755-900x601.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>For example, you can ask learners to recognise patterns in repeating sequences of colours and identify how to describe the sequences without repeating the colours many times. While it is good practice to link the learning from an unplugged activity back to a plugged activity, students will still benefit when that is not possible.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Emulators&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are also a significant number of devices which offer online emulator apps that mirror the functions of the physical device. Consider <a href="https://www.tts-group.co.uk/bee-bot-programmable-floor-robot/1015268.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bee-Bot floor robots</a>, which can be relatively expensive to purchase and may get damaged in a classroom. If you don&#8217;t have the physical device, its <a href="http://helloworld.cc/beebot-emulator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emulator app</a> provides a similar experience.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Similarly, the <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/microbit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">micro:bit</a>, a versatile microcontroller for young people, can be emulated in the MakeCode programming environment, including all its buttons and sensors. There are also numerous emulators which enable you to make and test your own circuits using a variety of hardware platforms. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What do you actually need?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Sometimes it can be helpful to look up what devices you actually need — they might not be as expensive as you think. General-purpose, single-board computers such as <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raspberry Pi</a> can be bought new for less than £25, and more powerful models still under £50.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="772" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b.jpg" alt="A young learner is building his project at a Coolest Projects event." class="wp-image-90236" style="width:762px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b.jpg 1024w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b-500x377.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b-768x579.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b-800x603.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b-450x339.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b-900x679.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p>Similarly, microcontrollers such as <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raspberry Pi Pico</a>, <a href="https://microbit.org/buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">micro:bit</a>, or <a href="https://redfernelectronics.co.uk/crumble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Crumble</a>, range from about £5 to £20 per device. Accessories such as LEDs, jumper leads, motors, and buzzers are also reasonably priced. They can be a relatively low-cost entry into physical computing and robotics, especially if you pair them with craft materials or share devices between students.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make the most of it&nbsp;</h2>



<p>However limited your access to devices is, I encourage you to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Look out for partners or solution providers that prioritise inclusivity and accessibility in their resources</li>



<li>Consider whether you can make activities accessible on a wider range of devices and use what students may already have (check out <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/octostudio-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the OctoStudio app</a> for smartphones for example)</li>



<li>Use unplugged activities, and relate them back to plugged devices when possible</li>



<li>Look up devices which might be more affordable than you realised</li>
</ul>

<p>In this blog post, we will share more about the safety features of Experience CS, and the steps we’ve taken to make the platform a great fit for your school.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A safe, teacher-managed environment</h2>



<p>Experience CS supports young people to develop their understanding of computer science through engaging, interactive projects using the programming language Scratch. Scratch is a popular block-based language that helps young people get started with coding, and Experience CS includes a version of Scratch that we have built especially for schools. With our version, which is fully integrated into the Experience CS platform, students can explore coding in a teacher-managed, closed environment that aligns with schools’ safeguarding policies and gives you full control over what your students see and do.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="609" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/scratch_experience_cs.jpg" alt="Scratch coding within Experience CS.

If you&#8217;ve used our Code Editor, you&#8217;ll recognise this interface.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Student safety and privacy are at the forefront in Experience CS, which means:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A private, closed environment</strong>. Projects are kept within the classroom and cannot be published to a public gallery.<br></li>



<li><strong>Teacher-controlled access</strong>. Students don’t need to create or manage their own accounts. Teachers manage their students’ access, with no student email addresses required.<br></li>



<li><strong>No social features</strong>. Students don’t create public profiles or follow other users, and there are no chat or comment features for young people.<br></li>



<li><strong>Curated content</strong>. Students can only access the projects and materials you share with them, not content from other users.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tailor-made for schools</h2>



<p>We have designed every part of the Experience CS platform with school environments in mind, making it easier for teachers to manage and for students to use.</p>



<p>Here’s how:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fully integrated platform.</strong> Everything students need is built into the Experience CS platform, including Scratch, lesson resources, student materials, and project templates. There is no need to visit other websites.<br></li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Scratch?</strong></h2>



<p>Scratch is a free, beginner-friendly coding platform that allows young people to create animations, games, and interactive stories using simple visual blocks. Scratch removes some of the complexity of coding by replacing syntax-heavy programming languages with intuitive drag-and-drop blocks. This lets creativity take centre stage and makes it the perfect first step for young coders.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-scaled.jpg" alt="Two young people smiling whilst working on their laptop with an adult mentor by their side." class="wp-image-88616" style="width:658px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/10/CodeClub_ParkStreet-04-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why Scratch is the ideal starting point</strong></h2>



<p>Every coding journey begins with a single step. Scratch delivers this first step in a way that is playful, approachable, and empowering. Scratch immediately delivers tangible results that new coders can feel proud of by linking coding to storytelling, design, and play. It also cultivates curiosity, confidence, and resilience — qualities crucial to long-term success in both coding and problem solving.</p>



<p>Most importantly, Scratch emphasises exploration over perfection. It invites young learners to experiment freely, troubleshoot confidently, and express themselves creatively without fear of making mistakes. This exploratory mindset provides the foundation for future technical proficiency and innovation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Get started with our free projects</strong></h2>



<p>Starting with structured projects helps young learners build solid coding skills while maintaining enthusiasm and enjoyment.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/catch-the-bus"><strong>Catch the bus (animation)</strong></a></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="688" height="361" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-9.png" alt="" class="wp-image-90175" style="width:662px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-9.png 688w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-9-300x157.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-9-500x262.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-9-450x236.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /></figure></div>


<p>In ‘Catch the bus’, coders create an animation featuring a character (called a sprite in Scratch) attempting to catch a departing bus. They learn how to sequence events, switch costumes to simulate movement, and synchronise actions to tell a simple story. This introduces fundamental storytelling and animation skills in Scratch.</p>



<p><strong>What you&#8217;ll learn:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Timing and sequencing actions</li>



<li>Using costume changes to simulate movement</li>



<li>Creating narrative animations</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/chomp-the-cheese"><strong>Chomp the cheese (interactive)</strong></a></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1344" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-scaled.png" alt="" class="wp-image-90176" style="width:664px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-scaled.png 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-300x157.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-500x262.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-768x403.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-1536x806.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-2048x1075.png 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-800x420.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-450x236.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-10-900x472.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure></div>


<p>In ‘Chomp the cheese’, learners use facial recognition tools in Scratch Lab to build an interactive game controlled by mouth movements. Using a webcam, players physically open their mouths to &#8220;chomp&#8221; virtual cheese snacks on screen. This playful and engaging activity introduces machine learning concepts in a tangible and enjoyable way.</p>



<p><strong>What you&#8217;ll learn:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Using facial recognition in Scratch</li>



<li>Creating interactive games with webcam input</li>



<li>Basic concepts of machine learning and interactivity</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/boat-race"><strong>Boat race (game)</strong></a></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="688" height="361" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-90177" style="width:664px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-11.png 688w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-11-300x157.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-11-500x262.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-11-450x236.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px" /></figure></div>


<p>In ‘Boat race’, young coders create a game where players navigate a boat around obstacles, steering using mouse controls. They learn to handle player input, detect collisions, and define conditions for winning. This foundational game-making experience sets the stage for more complex creations in the future.</p>



<p><strong>What you&#8217;ll learn:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Controlling sprites with mouse clicks</li>



<li>Collision detection between sprites</li>



<li>Defining goals and win conditions</li>
</ul>



<p>&#8220;The key to sparking a lifelong interest in coding is excitement. When young people are building something they genuinely care about, they&#8217;re not worried about getting everything perfect on the first try. They&#8217;re chasing their ideas and learning as they go. Scratch creates the ideal environment for this type of messy, brilliant exploration. It provides young coders with the freedom to experiment, persevere, and express themselves — all while enjoying the process,&#8221; or so says my amazing colleague Pete Bell, Learning Manager and creator of some of our most engaging content at the Raspberry Pi Foundation. I have to say, I agree with him!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Level up and build momentum</strong></h2>



<p>After completing their first projects, young coders can continue to build momentum through several exciting avenues:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ready-to-remix-favourite-projects-to-tinker-with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Personalise projects</a>:</strong> Encourage learners to remix existing projects by altering characters, backgrounds, and rules. Personalisation deepens learning and fosters ownership of the coding experience.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/python" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Explore Python</a>:</strong> Scratch&#8217;s block-based coding naturally leads to curiosity about text-based languages like Python, which many learners find an exciting next step.</li>



<li><strong><a href="https://codeclub.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Join a Code Club</a>:</strong> Coding alongside peers transforms individual learning into a social experience. Code Clubs offer a collaborative environment where learners solve problems together, share creations, and build lasting friendships.</li>
</ul>



<p>Encouraging personalisation, curiosity, and community involvement keeps learners motivated and engaged on their coding journey.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Our partnership with the Raspberry Pi Foundation</strong></h2>



<p>Experience AI is an artificial intelligence (AI) literacy programme, co-developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Google DeepMind, that teaches students aged 11 to 14 about AI and machine learning. Thanks to funding from <a href="http://google.org">Google.org</a>, Parent Zone has partnered with the Raspberry Pi Foundation to provide free training to UK educators, equipping them with the skills they need to effectively deliver the programme in their settings.<br><br>The Experience AI <a href="http://rpf.io/expai-blog-parentzone1">resources </a>help educators, including those from non-technical backgrounds, to deliver impactful lessons on AI and machine learning. Lesson resources span technical elements (e.g. data-driven models, bias) and practical elements (e.g. careers, safety).</p>



<p>Our face-to-face and virtual training sessions show teachers how to use the programme resources, as well as helping them feel more confident in the subject matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sessions also give me an opportunity to hear from teachers about how AI is being used and taught in classrooms,&nbsp;and the opportunities and challenges it’s creating.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Curiosity and experimentation</strong></h2>



<p>AI has a major presence in many schools now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teachers tell me they’re seeing students use AI to support their homework. One teacher spoke about a student using a chatbot to help break down a maths problem, describing it like “having a tutor at home.”</p>



<p>Teachers are also using AI themselves to assist in their work — for example, to plan lessons, generate activities, and get ideas on how to explain complex topics more clearly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Openness to experimentation is clearly there.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1.jpg" alt="Educators at a workshop." class="wp-image-90150" style="width:800px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/experience-ai-1-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Addressing concerns</strong></h2>



<p>For all the benefits of AI, teachers also have concerns about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some have told me their students have no idea how easily these tools can be used to mislead or manipulate, through disinformation and deepfakes, for example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why Experience AI resources are meeting educator needs. Not only do they explain how AI and machine learning actually work, but they also address many pressing concerns around AI, from responsible usage and media literacy, to how data bias can affect the final output.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Positive changes</strong></h2>



<p>In all the workshops, what stands out to me most is how ready teachers are to engage. They want to understand more. They want to help their students make sense of AI, and use it positively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’re grateful for practical, grounded training and support that doesn’t assume they’ve all got computer science degrees. After one of our sessions, a teacher said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“The better we educate ourselves, the better we&#8217;re able to help young people. It’s important because it&#8217;s affecting their day-to-day lives. We can help them navigate AI platforms, but in a safe way.”</em></p>

<p>’Digital literacy’ is a term that seems to pop up everywhere. In the early 2000s, it was the next big thing; some even suggested it might replace traditional literacy and numeracy. But, like many educational trends, it soon faded from the spotlight, and became something that schools &#8216;should&#8217; do, or something left to the lone teacher who had been handed the role of IT coordinator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For many teachers, at least in the UK, digital literacy meant booking a set of laptops (and hoping the last class had remembered to charge them) and ticking off history learning objectives by making a PowerPoint about Henry VIII’s wives. It became a bit of an afterthought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More recently, digital literacy seems to have been rebranded as ‘digital skills’, often framed as the capabilities young people need for the workplace of tomorrow. But I don’t think that tells the full story.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Digital literacy beyond employability</h2>



<p>Digital literacy isn’t just about employability; it’s about fairness and access. It’s about more than just learning to use spreadsheets (though my love for Excel remains strong); it’s about ensuring that all young people have the knowledge and confidence to navigate the digital world we live in today.</p>



<p>Digital literacy is about understanding the digital tools we rely on every day, securely accessing online services, making informed decisions about sharing personal information, and critically evaluating the endless stream of news and misinformation online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/teach/ai-education">about artificial intelligence</a>: not just playing with the latest tools, but <a href="http://rpf.io/expai-hw-blogra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">understanding how they work</a>, the biases built into them, and the ways they shape our lives.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-scaled.jpg" alt="Three ways to help students learn about the impact of technology" class="wp-image-90006" style="width:652px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/CoderDojo-CCW-07-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure></div>


<p>True digital literacy empowers young people to engage with technology thoughtfully, critically, and confidently. And that’s something worth making space for. To truly ensure that young people have fair access to the digitally enabled world we live in, we must equip them with the skills to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/should-we-ditch-the-term-digital-native-the-latest-conversation-on-the-podcast/">understand and use technology effectively</a>. This means making space for digital literacy <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/">within the curriculum</a> and ensuring that all teachers feel confident in delivering it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Digital literacy as a core part of teaching</h2>



<p>Every teacher has a role to play in helping students develop these essential skills. This requires high-quality curriculum resources that integrate digital tools meaningfully into different subjects, as well as <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/courses/learn-python">comprehensive teacher training</a> to ensure every educator feels empowered to teach digital literacy as part of their everyday practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let’s not treat digital literacy like that forgotten box of tangled charging cables in the staffroom (important, but nobody is quite sure what to do with it). Instead, let’s make it a core part of teaching, just like reading, writing, and knowing how to keep a straight face when a student asks if they really need to save their work.</p>

<p>If we get this right, we’re not just preparing young people for the jobs of tomorrow, we’re making sure they can navigate today’s digital world safely, confidently, and with the critical thinking skills to tell fact from fiction (because let’s face it, the internet isn’t exactly short on absolute nonsense).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, who’s up for making a PowerPoint about Henry VIII’s wives?&nbsp;</p>
