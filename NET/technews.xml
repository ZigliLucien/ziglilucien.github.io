<p>I am delighted to announce that the Raspberry Pi Foundation is the new home for Blockly, the world&#8217;s leading open source library for visual programming.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Blockly?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Blockly is a free, open source library that enables developers to build applications and websites that use block-based coding interfaces. That means that instead of typing code, you snap blocks together to build programs. Behind the scenes, those blocks are turned into text-based code like JavaScript and Python.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockly started life in 2011 in Google as a passion project of one engineer. Since then — thanks to the generous support of Google, a small team of brilliant engineers, and an amazing community of open source contributors and partners — it has grown to become the de facto standard for visual programming interfaces.</p>



<p>In particular, Blockly is the foundation for pretty much all of the block-based coding applications that you may have used to teach or learn about programming. Platforms like Scratch, MakeCode, and MIT&#8217;s App Inventor are all built with Blockly. It&#8217;s no exaggeration to say that hundreds of millions of young people have learnt the fundamentals of computer science using software that is built with Blockly.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="500" height="334" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6563-500x334.jpg" alt="Young people use laptops to do their coding tasks." class="wp-image-91250" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6563-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6563-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6563-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6563-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6563-450x301.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6563-900x601.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6563.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>As we enter the age of AI, it is more important than ever that all young people develop a foundational understanding of computer science. Blockly and the block-based coding platforms and applications that it enables are essential to realising that vision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can read more about the importance of coding in the age of AI in our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-kids-still-need-to-learn-to-code-in-the-age-of-ai/">position paper</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockly is also widely used to create interfaces that control hardware and robotics platforms. And, while its main use cases are in education, Blockly is increasingly being used to build industrial and commercial applications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does this change mean?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>From 10 November 2025, the Blockly open source library and assets, and key members of the Blockly team will transition from Google to the Raspberry Pi Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our vision is for Blockly to continue to be the standard visual programming interface that makes coding accessible to all. We are committed to maintaining Blockly as an open source project, and to working collaboratively with the community of developers and educators.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Clubs-conference_2_HD-72-500x333.jpg" alt="Educators collaborating on projects at a desk, with laptops open displaying a block-based coding environment." class="wp-image-88519" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Clubs-conference_2_HD-72-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Clubs-conference_2_HD-72-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Clubs-conference_2_HD-72-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Clubs-conference_2_HD-72-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Clubs-conference_2_HD-72-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Clubs-conference_2_HD-72-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Clubs-conference_2_HD-72-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Clubs-conference_2_HD-72-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Over the next year, we will roll out features that improve accessibility, including screen reader support and keyboard navigation, working closely with partners to support implementation of these accessibility improvements across their platforms.</p>



<p>Looking to the future, we want to make sure that Blockly is at the leading edge of innovations that support the teaching and learning of programming in the age of AI. We&#8217;re also excited about the potential for the Blockly team to collaborate with the Foundation&#8217;s research, learning, and product teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are already part of the community of developers and educators, then I want to reassure you that you can continue to expect the same outstanding partnership and support from the Blockly team. We also look forward to welcoming many more members to the Blockly community over the coming years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, I want to say a huge thank you to Google for their support for Blockly over the years, and for enabling this transition with generous grant funding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do you teach AI in a way that resonates with 11- to 14-year-olds long after the lesson ends? In two recent <a href="https://experience-ai.org/">Experience AI</a> webinars, we explored that question with collaborators from <strong>Google Research</strong>, <strong>Google DeepMind</strong>, and the <strong>Stanford Accelerator for Learning</strong>. During the webinars, we also showcased <strong>AI Quests</strong>, a gamified, classroom-first experience where learners use AI concepts to solve real problems.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The AI technology you’ll experience is amazing, but it’s not magic. Success depends on the decisions you make.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That line, delivered by Professor Sky, the in-game mentor, captures the core message of AI Quests: AI systems are built by people and shaped by human judgment at every step.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is AI Quests?</h2>



<p>We’ve embedded AI Quests into the <a href="https://experience-ai.org/en/units/foundations-of-ai">Foundations of AI</a> unit in Experience AI, our free AI literacy programme created with Google DeepMind. </p>



<p>As Google Research’s Liat Ben Rafael explained, “AI Quests is a gamified experience… where students discover firsthand how AI is used in the real world to create positive impact.” Each quest is grounded in a real research programme and mirrors the AI project lifecycle you’ll recognise from our Experience AI lessons: define the problem, prepare data, train, test, deploy.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/KIDS-VISUALS.00_17_45_20.Still024-500x281.jpg" alt="Photo of a young person playing AI Quests on a laptop. The AI Quests character Luna, can clearly be seen on the young person's screen." class="wp-image-91741" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/KIDS-VISUALS.00_17_45_20.Still024-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/KIDS-VISUALS.00_17_45_20.Still024-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/KIDS-VISUALS.00_17_45_20.Still024-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/KIDS-VISUALS.00_17_45_20.Still024-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/KIDS-VISUALS.00_17_45_20.Still024-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/KIDS-VISUALS.00_17_45_20.Still024-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/KIDS-VISUALS.00_17_45_20.Still024-900x506.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/KIDS-VISUALS.00_17_45_20.Still024.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>The first quest, Market Marshes, asks students to help Luna, one of the central characters, to protect a riverside market from flooding. Players roam, gather candidate data (from rainfall stats to town gossip), clean it, choose relevant features, and train a model. If the model underperforms, they iterate, exactly as real AI developers would.</p>



<p>Emma Staves, Learning Manager at the Foundation, notes that a key moment is when learners test their model: “It’s made really clear that the data that’s being used to test the model is historic data.” That simple design choice can help you to unlock rich discussions with your learners about validation, reliability, and what counts as “accurate enough” for real decisions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Designed around how students actually learn</strong></h2>



<p>Developed in collaboration with learning scientists at the Stanford Accelerator for Learning, the quests reflect what Victor Lee, Faculty Lead for AI and Education at Stanford, describes as “enduring understanding”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The enduring understanding is about how humans can initiate and design AI applications that can address some of humanity’s biggest unsolved challenges.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To keep that focus, the team blends:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Situated learning</strong> – for example, a concrete flood scenario rather than abstract exercises</li>



<li><strong>Pedagogical agents</strong> – characters who nudge, model, and explain</li>



<li><strong>Embedded feedback and productive failure</strong> – learn by trying, revising, and trying again</li>



<li><strong>Self-explanation prompts</strong> – ‘learning tickets’ that ask students to articulate what they’re doing and why</li>
</ul>



<p>In other words, the quests are all about playing with purpose.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What teachers are seeing in the classroom</strong></h2>



<p>We piloted AI Quests with some teachers, including Dave Cross, Curriculum Leader for Computer Science at North Liverpool Academy, who tested the quests with his Year 7 students, before extending it to his GCSE classes:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We see it moving forward as a really solid foundation… for that further learning.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also saw strong cross-curricular ties: geography colleagues spotted “massive opportunities” to use the flood quest in their own units, while broader staff discussions turned to digital citizenship, data literacy, and fairness. The cross-disciplinary nature of AI is increasingly apparent, and so AI literacy shouldn’t be limited to computing — students need to encounter AI across multiple subjects and in everyday life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Where the research comes in: Forecasting floods days in advance</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="280" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Flood-in-Market-500x280.png" alt="Graphic of the flooded marketplace from the Market Marshes quest on AI Quests." class="wp-image-91742" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Flood-in-Market-500x280.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Flood-in-Market-300x168.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Flood-in-Market-768x430.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Flood-in-Market-800x448.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Flood-in-Market-450x252.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Flood-in-Market-900x504.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Flood-in-Market.png 1400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>The second webinar connected the classroom experience to the real project it’s modelled on: Google Research Flood Forecasting. Gila Loike, Product Manager, set the scene:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Our research team develops AI models that predict flooding all over the world, five to seven days before the flood occurs.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Deborah Cohen, the Research Scientist leading the team at Google Research focused on flooding, also explained that traditional models can’t easily predict floods in places with little data. However, AI can fill those gaps by combining information from rivers, weather forecasts, and satellites, to give accurate warnings around the world:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“With AI we were able to expand our coverage to the entire world.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The results are real and practical. Accurate predictions help:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>People stay safe by receiving flood alerts through familiar apps</li>



<li>Emergency teams plan routes and close roads in time</li>



<li>Farmers decide whether to move animals or harvest early</li>



<li>Aid organisations act sooner, delivering supplies or financial support before the flood hits</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="280" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Market-500x280.png" alt="Graphic from the Market Marshes quest on AI Quests." class="wp-image-91743" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Market-500x280.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Market-300x168.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Market-768x430.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Market-1536x860.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Market-800x448.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Market-450x252.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Market-900x504.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-1-Market.png 1700w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>To make sure their models work well, the team compares predictions with real river data, where available, and with satellite images showing flooded areas. Students explore these same ideas in the AI Quest game, cleaning messy data, testing their models, and checking how accurate their results are.</p>



<p>“Students are really engaged by the real-world challenge,” said Emma Staves about the Market Marshes quest. “That authenticity makes learning come alive.” It helps students see how classroom ideas, like features, accuracy, bias, and model cards, connect directly to real decisions and their consequences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coming soon: Health quests and more languages</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-2-Meet-Dr-Visus-1-500x281.png" alt="Graphic from the second AI Quests." class="wp-image-91744" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-2-Meet-Dr-Visus-1-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-2-Meet-Dr-Visus-1-300x168.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-2-Meet-Dr-Visus-1-768x431.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-2-Meet-Dr-Visus-1-1536x862.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-2-Meet-Dr-Visus-1-800x449.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-2-Meet-Dr-Visus-1-450x252.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-2-Meet-Dr-Visus-1-900x505.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/Quest-2-Meet-Dr-Visus-1.png 2000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Liat also gave a sneak peek at the next quest, a health-focused story on blindness prevention. It introduces new layers — privacy, diverse data, field testing — while following the same lifecycle. More quests are in development, with additional languages planned from early 2026.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why this matters now</strong></h2>



<p>The key message from both webinars is clear: AI literacy isn’t just about using technology — it’s about understanding our role in shaping it. As one Stanford researcher put it, “AI isn’t this magic thing that just happens to us. Humans decide how to use it, and how choices around data affect accuracy and fairness.”</p>



<p>Our goal with Experience AI is to help young people become thoughtful, creative problem-solvers who can navigate an AI-powered world with confidence and integrity — and AI Quests fits perfectly with that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Experience AI?</h2>



<p><a href="https://experience-ai.org/">Experience AI</a> is a free educational programme that helps teachers and students learn about artificial intelligence (AI). It was developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in partnership with Google DeepMind and includes lessons, classroom resources, and hands-on activities to help students develop a foundational understanding of AI technologies, their social and ethical implications, and the role that AI can play in their lives.</p>



<p>It is based on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/">original research into AI literacy</a> and highlights real-world applications of AI technologies, including through videos featuring research scientists that help to bring the lessons to life for students.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-800x600.png" alt="A group of students and educators at Penang Science Cluster's launch of Experience AI in Malaysia." class="wp-image-87201" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-800x600.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-300x225.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-500x375.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-768x576.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-450x338.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia-900x675.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Experience-AI-launch-event-in-Malaysia.png 1000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A group of students and educators at the launch of Experience AI in Malaysia.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Since we launched the first Experience AI resources in April 2023, they have been used to teach over 2 million students, and that number is growing fast.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This reach is possible thanks to a global network of <a href="https://experience-ai.org/en/partners">Experience AI education partners</a> who work with us to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/localising-ai-education-adapting-experience-ai-resources/">localise and translate the resources</a> and deliver large-scale teacher training in their regions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">UNESCO recognition</h2>



<p>Experience AI was one of four laureates of the prestigious global Prize selected by the Director-General of UNESCO, based on recommendations from an independent, international jury. The jury commended the programme for its strong ethical&nbsp;foundation and wide international reach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year, marking its 20th anniversary, the Prize focused on the theme ‘Preparing learners and teachers for the ethical and responsible use of artificial intelligence’.</p>

<p>The Prize was awarded at a ceremony at the University of Bahrain attended by the Director-General of UNESCO, Ministers of Education of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and members of the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Google DeepMind teams.</p>



<p>I want to say a heartfelt congratulations and thank you to everyone who has worked on Experience AI so far. It has been a fantastic, collaborative effort from colleagues across the Foundation, Google DeepMind, and all of our partner organisations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also want to pay tribute to all of the teachers — all over the world — who have engaged so enthusiastically with Experience AI, for helping us develop the materials, including testing them in your classrooms and providing such thoughtful feedback, and for everything you do, every day, to inspire your students. This recognition is for all of your hard work, diligence, and care. Congratulations and thank you.</p>

<p>Experience AI is provided at no cost to schools, teachers, or students thanks to generous funding from Google.org. We are also very grateful to Broadcom Foundation, which has provided additional funding to support the programme. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What next for Experience AI?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We are exceptionally proud to have received this recognition for Experience AI, but we aren&#8217;t complacent. Equipping all young people, and their teachers, with a foundational understanding of AI technologies is one of the most urgent challenges facing all education systems.</p>



<p>We have made a great start, and we know there is much more to be done. That&#8217;s why we have lots of important updates and developments coming soon, including:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Updating and improving the current lessons:</strong> We are finalising an update to the resources to respond to feedback from teachers and students, including significant improvements to make them more accessible. These will be published early in 2026.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Expanding the range of lessons:</strong> Alongside the updates to the existing resources, we are developing new lessons. This will include lessons designed for both younger and older learners, as well as integrated lessons that enable teachers to bring AI concepts and skills into subjects such as science, language, and the arts.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Updated and improved professional development:</strong> We are also updating and improving the training that we offer to teachers, including both online courses and webinars, and in-person training delivered through the global network of education partners.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>AI chatbot for educators:</strong> We recently integrated a chatbot into the Experience AI website. Powered by Gemini 2.5, this is intended as a tool to help teachers navigate and understand the concepts and lessons. This is an early experiment and we&#8217;d love to get your feedback, so please give it a try and let us know what you think.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Expanding the global network of partners:</strong> We currently have partners supporting teacher professional development in 25 countries, from Malaysia to Mexico. Over the coming year we will be launching partnerships in at least 15 more countries. If your organisation is interested in becoming a partner, you can let us know by <a href="https://form.raspberrypi.org/4873612">filling in this form</a>.</li>

<p>In August, young tech creators from across Sri Lanka gathered for the country’s second-ever in-person Coolest Projects event, hosted by our partner <a href="https://stemup.lk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">STEMUP Educational Foundation</a>. The showcase was a chance for young people to share and celebrate their ideas and inventions with families, friends, mentors, and the wider digital making community, while having lots of fun trying out projects and meeting fellow creators.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9997.jpg" alt="Coolest Projects Sri Lanka 2025." class="wp-image-91706" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9997.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9997-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9997-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9997-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9997-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<p>With 150 projects showcased by 200 young people, the event highlighted the incredible creativity and problem-solving skills that come into play when young people have an opportunity to get hands-on with technology and explore their curiosity. It was great to be there on the day and hear from the creators themselves. From a cake chase game (that was really about the importance of friendship) to an AI-powered classifier that could identify organic and non-organic material, there was no shortage of imagination on display.</p>



<p>Here are just a few of the standout projects I saw at the event.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="490" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1679.png" alt="The Robot Bag project at Coolest Projects Sri Lanka." class="wp-image-91695" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1679.png 600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1679-300x245.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1679-500x408.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1679-450x368.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Udula | Robot Bag, Hardware category</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Inspired by young people carrying heavy backpacks full of textbooks, Udula created ‘Robot Bag’ to help people of all ages carry their bags. You simply place your bag on the robot, and it will start following you around! One challenge Udula faced was trying to figure out how far the robot was from people. With just one camera, the robot could not really determine depth, so it could not detect how far away a walking person was. To solve this, he added two more cameras at an angle. This allowed him to calculate a more accurate average distance using input from all three cameras.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="700" height="525" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1656.png" alt="The Ripley’s Adventure: Beyond the Horizon project at Coolest Projects Sri Lanka." class="wp-image-91696" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1656.png 700w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1656-300x225.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1656-500x375.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1656-450x338.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Yahya | Ripley’s Adventure: Beyond the Horizon, Scratch category</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Yahya built an astronaut reaction time game that followed Ripley, an astronaut in training. In order to pass his training, he had to hit as many moving targets as possible in one minute. Thankfully, Yahya had built an adjustable difficulty level, so I could complete the challenge in spite of my slow reaction times!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685.png" alt="The Jellyfish or Plastic Bag? project at Coolest Projects Sri Lanka." class="wp-image-91697" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685.png 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685-300x225.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685-500x375.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685-768x576.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685-800x600.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685-450x338.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1685-900x675.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Khadeejah | Jellyfish or Plastic Bag? AI to Differentiate Jellyfish from Plastic Bags, AI category</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Khadeejah is passionate about the environment and learned that ocean clean-up technology tools often incorrectly identify jellyfish and plastic bags. Underwater, they have a lot of the same characteristics and movements: they are translucent, flexible, and amorphous. She started creating her own dataset and training her own AI model to distinguish between the two. In doing so, she learned a lot about AI bias and how creating a balanced dataset is really important to prevent bias and improve accuracy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Young people leading the way</strong></h2>



<p>From beginners to experienced programmers, every young creator at the event had the chance to celebrate their work, talk about their ideas, and see what others were building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having so many young creators in one space highlighted the importance of providing opportunities where they can share ideas, learn from one another, and build a sense of community. We would like to say a huge thank you to STEMUP Educational Foundation for organising such an inspiring day, and to the volunteers and mentors who made the event possible. Most importantly, thank you to the young digital makers of Sri Lanka for sharing your creativity with us. We can’t wait to see what you will make next!</p>

<p>Simon Peyton Jones, British computer scientist and Member of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, says in his article &#8216;Programming the Future&#8217;:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Designing and writing software is one of the most demanding, intellectually stretching tasks that humans undertake. If we build a building, we are limited by the strength of steel — we can only make the tower so high before it will fall under its own weight. But software knows no such limits. The only limit is our own ability (or inability) to manage the complexity of the systems we build. That is humbling — but also exciting.”</p>

<p>Coolest Projects India is officially a wrap, and we are absolutely thrilled with the results! The event, held on 20 September 2025 in Hyderabad, Telangana, was a fantastic showcase of the incredible talent and passion of young creators. With over 250 participants, young creators showcased 118 projects, demonstrating the thriving digital making community across India.</p>



<p>The projects on display were truly inspirational, tackling important topics such as environmental sustainability and the responsible use of AI. From hardware to Scratch to AI, creators showcased an incredible variety of projects that brought their ideas to life, from simple creations to complex inventions.</p>



<p>Here are just a few of the standout projects from the day.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252.jpg" alt="Young creators at Coolest Projects India." class="wp-image-91650" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252-500x282.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02252-900x507.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Avyukt, 9 years old | The EchoCharm Spellbox, Hardware category</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A truly magical project was <strong>The EchoCharm Spellbox</strong>, an interactive creation that used a Raspberry Pi computer and a speaker to bring the famous Harry Potter artifact to life. This project was a perfect blend of creativity and coding, showcasing how technology can be used for fun and entertainment.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114.jpg" alt="Young creators at Coolest Projects India." class="wp-image-91651" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC04114-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Aahil, 11 | Automatic Seed Sowbot, Hardware category</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>We were also blown away by the <strong>Automatic Seed Sowbot,</strong> a practical invention that used a tiny camera and AI to quickly and accurately sort seeds. This clever hardware project tackles a real-world problem and has fantastic applications in agriculture and farming.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="563" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231.jpg" alt="Young creators at Coolest Projects India." class="wp-image-91652" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231-500x282.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/DSC02231-900x507.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Pranamya, Medha, Manvi, Aradhna — these 13-year-old-girls all come from Karnataka state | Unspoken Truths, Mobile apps category</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Another brilliant project that we saw was <strong>Unspoken Truths</strong>, a fun mobile app for interesting conversations to reveal hidden truths and secrets about yourself and your friends. If you&#8217;re ever looking to break the ice or deepen your connections, Unspoken Truth provides an entertaining way to start a conversation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A community of creators</h2>



<p>From first-time coders to seasoned programmers, every young person showcasing their work had the chance to celebrate their ideas and feel part of a vibrant community. The event created a unique atmosphere where participants were able to proudly share their projects with family, friends, and the wider coding community. They all received certificates to celebrate their fantastic achievements.</p>



<p>This year’s showcase brought together creators from different parts of the country, highlighting the incredible passion for digital making in India. It was a powerful reminder that when you put technology into the hands of young people with curiosity, there is no limit to what they can create.</p>



<p>A massive thank you to our organisers, volunteers, and the dedicated mentors who made the event possible. And most importantly, thank you to the young creators of India for sharing their ingenuity and creativity with us! We can&#8217;t wait to see what you’ll build next.</p>



<p>Thank you to our sponsors, Qube Research and Technologies, for sponsoring the hardware category.</p>

<p>The Global Clubs Partner network brings together 52 partners from 45 countries, all working together to positively impact their local communities and open up opportunities for the next generation.</p>



<p>Last month, our Global Clubs Partners came together in Sri Lanka for our annual meetup, celebrating collaboration and community. Hosted alongside the second-ever Coolest Projects Sri Lanka, the gathering brought partners from across the world to share ideas, learn together, and build connections that will carry into the year ahead.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526.jpg" alt="A group of educators at a conference." class="wp-image-91620" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1526-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building connections across the network</strong></h2>



<p>The in-person meetups are all about strengthening the sense of community among Global Clubs Partners. Ellie Proffitt from the RPF Global Partners team shared why coming together is so important:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It was wonderful to hear everyone’s experiences and connect over <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our shared mission.</a> Everyone was so keen to learn from each other, and being able to do that face to face made it even more valuable.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Sri Lanka meetup gave partners the space to get to know one another, learn from each other’s experiences, and think together about future goals for their clubs.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551.jpg" alt="Educators collaborate together during a workshop." class="wp-image-91621" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/10/IMG_9551-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exploring together</strong></h2>



<p>The agenda combined presentations, workshops, and plenty of time for discussion. It began with the Raspberry Pi Foundation team giving a presentation on our mission and strategy for partner work and beyond. Afterwards, each organisation introduced themselves and partners showcased their activities and successes. Together we explored how to build and sustain Code Club communities, experimented with creative ways to use AI in clubs, and got hands-on with unplugged activities that make computing accessible in low-tech settings. Partners also shared approaches to adapting content for their local contexts, and finished by developing their own vision and strategy for the next 12 months.</p>



<p>The variety of sessions meant there was something for everyone, whether partners were looking for new teaching ideas, strategic guidance, or inspiration from peers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“There were so many interesting topics, I wish we had more time to go more in depth. I love being able to speak with other organisations doing similar work. Having the Raspberry Pi Foundation facilitate the connections is an asset.” – Global Partner</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inspiring moments at Coolest Projects Sri Lanka</strong></h2>



<p>As part of the meetup, partners had the chance to attend Coolest Projects Sri Lanka 2025, where young people showcased their incredible tech creations. Seeing children proudly present projects ranging from apps to hardware builds was a highlight for many.</p>

<p>Since launch, we’ve seen educators across the US and beyond implement the first six integrated units, explore the tutorials, and join our webinars. We’re incredibly grateful to our early adopters who are already helping to shape the program’s future. With so much exciting content already available, what’s next for Experience CS?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Translations: Making Experience CS more accessible</strong></h2>



<p>We’re delighted to share that the initial six units are now available in Spanish and French. From the beginning, our goal has been to make Experience CS accessible to as many educators and learners as possible. We will continue translating new materials so more communities can integrate computer science into their classrooms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New units: Expanding knowledge with Experience CS</strong></h2>



<p>Educators asked us for more units — and we listened. Three brand-new units for grades 3, 4, and 7 are now available, with additional units on the way. These new resources give educators and students the chance to go deeper into computing concepts while connecting them to other subject areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>3.2 Picture this!</strong> What can be used to create art? Explore how programming and art intersect by creating interactive word art.</li>



<li><strong>4.2 Digit dash: </strong>Design your own chase game! Collect items to score points, and change how valuable they are with a score multiplier.</li>



<li><strong>7.2 Harmony hackers:</strong> Become a digital composer! Learn the language of music through code as you program melodies and harmonies to build your very own song.</li>
</ul>



<p>The new units are currently available in English, with Spanish and French translations coming soon!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are shaping our world in many ways. Helping young people develop AI literacy — in other words, helping them understand how AI tools work and how to use them responsibly — is essential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we’re committed to empowering educators around the world with everything they need to teach AI confidently and help young people develop AI literacy. That’s why we developed Experience AI: a set of high-quality AI literacy resources designed in collaboration with Google DeepMind that any educator can use, no matter their level of tech knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="850" height="478" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5.png" alt="AI Quests" class="wp-image-91578" style="width:743px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5.png 850w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-450x253.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></figure></div>


<p>We’re excited to introduce a new addition to the Experience AI resources: AI Quests.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enter AI Quests</h2>



<p>Developed by Google Research in collaboration with the Stanford Accelerator for Learning, AI Quests is a browser-based learning experience that lets students step into the role of AI researchers. Through interactive, story-driven activities, they’ll explore essential AI topics such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Data preparation</li>



<li>Testing and evaluation</li>



<li>Bias in AI systems</li>
</ul>



<p>Students will use what they learn about these topics to tackle simulated global challenges. The first quest, Market Marshes, introduces them to how AI technology can be used in flood forecasting, while upcoming quests will explore other real-world issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why AI Quests matters</h2>



<p>AI technology is frequently used but often poorly understood. AI Quests, like Experience AI more broadly, gives students practical experience of how AI technology works, and shows why it’s so important.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Quest-1-Welcome-to-Market-Marshes-8.png" alt="Market Marshes AI Quest start screen" class="wp-image-91590" style="width:692px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>Here’s what sets AI Quests apart:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Gamified learning: Storytelling and role play turn abstract ideas into immersive experiences<br></li>



<li>Real-world relevance: Students see how AI technology addresses challenges like climate resilience and health equity<br></li>



<li>No prior knowledge required: Any teacher, regardless of subject specialism, can bring AI Quests into their classroom<br></li>



<li>Developed by experts: Built with Google Research and the Stanford Accelerator for Learning, content is high-quality and credible</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s next</h2>



<p>AI Quests is launching in English, with future plans for translations and additional quests to reach even more learners globally.</p>



<p>To support educators, we’re also hosting two free webinars on YouTube and LinkedIn:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>9 October at 4pm BST</li>



<li>16 October at 4pm BST</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tom Mason</strong> is Head of Mathematics and Head of ICT at St Joseph’s College, an all-boys secondary school in South East London. He is passionate about teaching and learning, and has a keen interest in digital education practices.</p>



<p>Mr Mason recently set his Year 10 students a creative coding challenge, which they completed using our <a href="https://editor.raspberrypi.org/en/education" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Editor for Education</a>. The challenge not only boosted student engagement, but also showcased the effectiveness of open-ended, student-led learning in computer science education.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Challenges in the classroom</strong></h2>



<p>Teaching coding in a classroom setting presents a unique set of challenges, with one of the most significant being the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Instead of engaging deeply with concepts like loops, conditions, and sorting algorithms, students now increasingly rely on AI tools to generate entire blocks of code for them, without understanding their functions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, traditional teacher-led instruction methods that focus on isolated coding concepts like inputs and outputs often leave students disconnected from the practical and creative aspects of programming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Against this backdrop, Mr Mason wanted to give his students the opportunity to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Apply their Python knowledge in meaningful ways</li>



<li>Collaborate and problem-solve independently</li>



<li>Explore unfamiliar programming concepts in a guided but open-ended fashion</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The project</strong></h2>



<p>Mr Mason set a simple but powerful brief:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Over three lessons, build a quiz that asks 10 questions about what you’ve learnt on the course.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With this simple instruction, Mr Mason gave students a clear idea about what to do, while giving them the freedom to design their quiz however they liked. Students were also told that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Their 10 quiz questions had to relate to Python</li>



<li>After creating their quiz, their classmates would give feedback based on key criteria (how well the code worked, the level of creativity, the user experience, etc.)</li>
</ul>



<p>To complete the project, students used<strong> </strong>the Code Editor for Education. Created in collaboration with educators and built purposefully for the classroom, the Code Editor supports a range of teaching styles and learning abilities. Its simple interface encourages students to engage with the logic behind their code — they can’t rely on autocomplete.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Results</strong></h2>



<p>The open-ended structure led to an explosion of creativity and problem-solving.<strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>Without step-by-step instructions, students had to independently explore solutions to questions like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“How do I randomise questions?”</li>



<li>“How can I hide quiz answers in a separate file?”</li>
</ul>



<p>Some students created multi-file Python projects, separating the logic controlling how the quiz worked from the content, or static information. For example, some students created one file to store the player’s answers and another file to manage the quiz interface and score logic. Students also created other advanced features:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Score tracking based on speed of response</li>



<li>Use of external Python libraries</li>



<li>Custom input and output formatting</li>



<li>Algorithms to randomly order quiz questions </li>
</ul>



<p>All students met the base requirements, but the open-ended nature of the project allowed more advanced students to push the boundaries, without the need for additional scaffolding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Educator reflection</strong></h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“They couldn’t just Google the answer; they had to think critically and test ideas. That’s what made it powerful.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mr Mason noted that the project’s success was due in large part to the flexibility and responsiveness of the Code Editor. Students could iterate quickly, test their ideas, and collaborate, all within a platform built for classroom coding.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It was the most successful thing I’ve done. I’ll definitely be doing it again every year.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key takeaways</strong></h2>
