<p>Coolest Projects is an annual global showcase for young people who love to make things with technology, whether it’s a clever Scratch game, a hardware hack, or an app that solves a real-world problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2025, we introduced a brand new AI category, supported by Amazon Future Engineer and Allianz, which drew over 100 impressive entries, covering everything from mood-sensing AI tools to jellyfish vs plastic bag image classifiers.</p>



<p>Last week, we celebrated all of these brilliant makers in a special livestream event. As always, a panel of VIP judges selected a few standout creations to highlight this year. You can catch up on the livestream here.</p>

<p>Experience CS is a brand-new, free, integrated computer science curriculum for elementary and middle school educators and anyone working with students aged 8 to 14. A key design principle for Experience CS is that any educator can use it. You don’t need a computer science qualification or previous experience in teaching computer science classes to deliver engaging and creative learning experiences for your students. That’s why, as US Executive Director, I’m especially pleased to announce the launch of the first six units in the curriculum today.</p>

<p>Read on to explore the new learning materials available and how you can start using them in your school.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Six integrated computer science units&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Experience CS enables educators to teach computer science through a curriculum that integrates CS concepts and knowledge into core subjects such as math, science, and social studies. Ashly Tritch, computer science immersion specialist at Olson Middle School in Bloomington, MN, USA, said, “Cross-curricular computer science is important because it shows students how coding and tech skills can be used in other subjects like math, science, or even art. It helps make learning more interesting and helps kids understand how computer science connects to real life. The lessons that the Raspberry Pi Foundation is creating will be super engaging, with fun and creative activities that keep students curious and excited to learn.”</p>



<p>Six <a href="https://experience-cs.org/units" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">integrated computer science units</a> are available to access, with more on the way. The units have been released in beta, and we would <a href="https://rpf.io/experience-cs-feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">love to hear your feedback</a> as we continue to make updates to the lesson materials. Each of the units includes an overview with a summary of the topics covered and a series of six to eight lessons, including lesson plans, slide decks, student-facing materials, and starter projects within our Code Editor for Education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have designed the units to be cross-curricular, so students can learn about computer science concepts while deepening their understanding of related subject area content. For example, in “<a href="https://experience-cs.org/units/the-me-project" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The me project</a>,” grade 4 students (ages 9–10) explore the basics of Scratch, personalise sprites, and develop programs to create an animation that tells a story all about them. The project could be integrated into language arts lessons, enabling young learners to explore visual representation and write their own unique stories. In the “<a href="https://experience-cs.org/units/smart-communities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smart communities</a>” unit, students in grade 6 (ages 11–12) explore ways in which computing and technology can be used to create environments that are responsive to the needs of community members; this could be included within science or technology lessons.</p>

<p>Initially, the curriculum and resources have been mapped to national and local standards in the US and Canada, including the K–12 Computer Science Teachers Association Standards for Students, but they are available for teachers and students anywhere in the world to use.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://experience-cs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">register for a free Raspberry Pi Foundation account</a> to start downloading the learning materials, including lesson plans, slide decks, student activity sheets and assessment criteria. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A version of Scratch built especially for schools&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Experience CS has been built from the ground up to support safe, confident computing lessons in real classrooms. It includes self-directed creative projects using the popular programming language Scratch. We have <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-cs-a-safe-creative-way-to-teach-computing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built a version of Scratch that is especially for schools</a>. That means it doesn’t have the community and sharing features that are central to the full Scratch platform. Instead, everything runs in a closed, classroom-ready environment that supports safeguarding policies and fits with school filtering systems. Simple and intuitive learning management features enable teachers to create accounts, set assignments, and review progress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to get started&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>On the &#8220;<a href="http://experience-cs.org/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Getting Started</a>&#8221; page, teachers will find everything they need, including helpful videos and tutorials. The <a href="https://form.raspberrypi.org/4874038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next webinar</a> takes place on 16th July, where we will walk you through all six units available at launch and show you how easy it is to get started with the learning materials. Whether you&#8217;re a CS teacher, general education teacher, administrator, or someone who works with school-aged young people, this session will give you the practical tools and guidance you need to bring Experience CS to life in your classroom or program.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Professional development&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>No matter your experience or skill level, the Experience CS content has been designed to be easy to use. However, we also provide professional development (PD) opportunities to help build confidence in teaching computer science.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teachers anywhere in the world can <a href="https://experience-cs.org/teaching-resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">access free online courses</a> offering flexible, self-paced learning to help you confidently teach block-based programming with effective, inclusive computing pedagogy. Our new course will develop your understanding of semantic waves while highlighting research-backed activities and examples directly from Experience CS units.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Help shape Experience CS</strong></h2>



<p>Experience CS is supported by Google and builds on the fantastic work they have done to support educators and students through <a href="https://support.google.com/csfirst/answer/15848549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CS First</a>. The team behind Experience CS includes educators with significant experience in teaching CS in elementary and middle school settings, and it is based on extensive classroom testing and research. We will continue to develop and improve the curriculum and resources in response to feedback from teachers and students.

<p>Young people everywhere deserve a high-quality computing education. But what a high-quality computing education looks like differs depending on a learner’s culture, context, and the existing provision in the country they live in. Therefore, adapting our educational resources for a range of contexts is a key part of our work at the Raspberry Pi Foundation, for example when we collaborate with partners to localise our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Computing Curriculum</a> resources.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4518.jpg" alt="Two young people using a computer." class="wp-image-90684" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4518.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4518-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4518-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4518-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4518-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4518-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4518-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>In this blog post, we share our experiences of adapting curriculum resources with our partners in Kenya, and the impact of this work. This is the first post in a mini-series of three — look out for the upcoming ones about our partnerships in the Indian states of Odisha and Telangana.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Our computing curriculum partnerships in Kenya</strong></h2>



<p>Last year, we embarked on partnerships in two areas of Kenya and aimed to roll out computing curriculum resources to students in grades 4 to 9 in Kenyan schools:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In Mombasa County, we began working with delivery partner <a href="https://techkidzafrica.co.ke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tech Kidz Africa</a> and the <a href="https://web.mombasa.go.ke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mombasa County government</a>. The programme is locally referred to as the Advancing Computing Literacy Project.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>In parallel, we partnered with the <a href="https://fcdc.or.ke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frontier Counties Development Council (FCDC)</a>, initially in eight counties. Here, the programme is locally referred to as the Digital Literacy Programme.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>During the 2024 academic year, we trained 39 local community trainers, who subsequently trained 453 teachers. We also adapted The Computing Curriculum materials to develop resources — lesson plans, presentation slides, and supporting activities — that are relevant and engaging in the schools our partners work with.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854.jpg" alt="Educators participate in a teacher training in Kenya." class="wp-image-90687" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2854-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Impact in 2024</strong></h2>



<p>We estimate that around 55,000 students were reached by our Kenya computing curriculum resources in 2024. Most teachers who had used our resources felt the lessons had improved their students&#8217; knowledge and skills. Of those who responded to our follow-up survey:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>94% agreed that their students had improved their knowledge of computing concepts</li>



<li>92% agreed that their students have developed their computing skills</li>



<li>90% agreed that their students better understand how to use technology safely.</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008.jpg" alt="Young people using tablets in a classroom." class="wp-image-90689" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0008-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>This was supported by conversations with teachers and students. In student focus groups, students were able to list topics they had learned about and skills they had developed.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“&#8230;.The lessons have had a significant positive impact on the students. They now demonstrate greater confidence in using technology, particularly with tasks involving programming in Scratch. This has improved their problem-solving skills and made them more engaged in learning.” – Teacher, Mombasa</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“In my computing lessons, I’ve learned how to use a computer safely and properly. I learned how to type, use the mouse, and open programs. We also learned about coding, which is really fun because we can make things happen on the screen by giving the computer instructions. I’ve also learned how to create a simple document using software like Excel sheets. I really enjoy using the computer to solve problems and make things work.” – Learner, Arid and Semi Arid Lands</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Implementation: Challenges, solutions, and building on progress</strong></h2>



<p>While teachers tended to agree that students’ skills and knowledge had increased, fewer felt that most students had achieved the specific learning objectives identified in the resources. This was often due to the content being only partially delivered, for example, due to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/teaching-digital-literacy-without-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limited availability of computing equipment</a> in schools. However, many students lacked prior experience with the topics covered in the lessons, suggesting a large improvement in their skills compared to a low baseline.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004.jpg" alt="Young people learning about computing in a classroom." class="wp-image-90693" style="width:720px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG-20250606-WA0004-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>Similarly, some training sessions were affected by challenges with the equipment, infrastructure, and learning environment available. Teachers were appreciative of the training and many have begun to deliver the computing lessons, but often lacked prior experience with computing and hence requested additional support.</p>



<p>In response to feedback from partners and teachers, we made some updates to our Computing Curriculum and training resources in preparation for the 2025 academic year. For example, we increased the alignment to Kenya’s national curriculum, prepared a more comprehensive teacher guide, and incorporated time for teachers to discuss solutions to common delivery challenges during training.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880.jpg" alt="Educators participate in a teacher training in Kenya." class="wp-image-90696" style="width:720px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2880-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>In 2025, we are working with partners to upskill even more teachers and broaden the reach of our computing lessons to a further four counties. Our partners have now begun upskilling both new and existing teachers on the updated resources, and we will continue to work with them to monitor and evaluate their programme’s success in the coming months.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Want to learn more about our curriculum resources?</strong></h2>



<p>You can access our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Computing Curriculum resources on our website</a> — we are currently working to make the materials for Kenya, and for India, downloadable there.</p>

<p>This year marked the <strong>10th anniversary of Coolest Projects Belgium</strong>. The meticulously organised event <em>was held in April by our partner </em><a href="https://coderdojobelgium.be/nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>CoderDojo Belgium</em></a>, at Technopolis in Mechelen. Themed ‘On the move’, the event invited young creators to interpret movement however they liked &#8211; which they did in an impressive number of ways, creating projects ranging from mobile robots and Scratch animations to AI tools, health tech devices, and a musical drink maker.</p>



<p>With 52 inspiring creations showcased by 71 young people, there were too many awesome projects to list individually in this blog post. Here are just a few of our highlights from a day filled with big ideas and brilliant builds.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rune | IINTS (Insulin Is Not the Solution)</strong></h2>



<p>Rune, who has type 1 diabetes, built his own open-source insulin pump powered by Raspberry Pi Pico W and featuring a custom motor-controlled delivery system designed in Autodesk Fusion. Rune’s pump calculates insulin doses based on carbohydrate amounts entered &#8211; all with the goal of empowering people, raising awareness, and making medical technology more accessible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Amir | AmirAI&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Amir might only be 10, but he is already experimenting with chatbots and AI in creative and playful ways. His self-coded AI assistant could respond live to visitors’ prompts, producing jokes and answers to questions. Amir’s project was a great demonstration of how accessible complex technologies can be when you give young people space to explore them.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/mocktail-2.png" alt="A project created by Jules named Operatie Mocktail." class="wp-image-90637" style="width:420px"/></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jules | Operatie Mocktail</strong></h2>



<p>This Arduino-powered machine blends mocktails based on your music choices. Pick a song, and the machine mixes a custom drink to match the song’s mood. It is a joyful combination of engineering, flavour science, and artistic flair. Jules described it best: “I want to create a unique drinking experience that connects taste and music in a surprising way.” We think it’s just right!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="709" height="944" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image4.png" alt="Mona after attending Coolest Projects." class="wp-image-90642" style="width:420px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image4.png 709w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image4-188x250.png 188w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image4-500x666.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image4-450x599.png 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mona | On the Move</strong></h2>



<p>Mona’s project is a reimagination of Michael Rosen’s poem <em>On the Move</em> created in Scratch, featuring animation, sound, and voice-over. It is a wonderful example of how digital storytelling can give new life to spoken word, and how creative coding platforms like Scratch provide space for emotion and expression.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital making: more than just a skill</strong></h2>



<p>Beyond these projects, the showcase included creations such as autonomous robots, arcade games, imaginative interface devices, and even a computer-controlled magic wand factory made of Lego bricks. Whether it was a creator’s very first Scratch project or a hand-built automaton, the range of work on display showed that coding and digital making are not just skills &#8211; they’re tools for self-expression, exploration, and change.</p>



<p>We would like to say a massive thank you to CoderDojo Belgium for hosting such an incredible event, and to the young creators, families, volunteers, and judges who made it such a success.</p>



<p>We are already looking forward to seeing what participants will create next!</p>

<p>At Code Club, we believe learning to code should be as fun as it is empowering — what better way to start than making your own game?</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1750" height="875" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01.png" alt="A mentor and a young tech creator at a computer at a Code Club session." class="wp-image-88496" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01.png 1750w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-300x150.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-500x250.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-768x384.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-1536x768.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-800x400.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-450x225.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/09/Code_Club-01-900x450.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1750px) 100vw, 1750px" /></figure></div>


<p>Whether it’s about pixelated pirates, racing robots, or a time-travelling llama, creating a game is one of the most exciting ways to explore coding. We’ve seen young people go from “I like Minecraft” to “I’ve built a space adventure with hedgehogs” in no time at all.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why games?</strong></h2>



<p>Games are more than just fun. They’re also a brilliant gateway into problem solving, creativity, and computational thinking. When you create your own game, you learn how to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use logic and sequences to control what happens</li>



<li>Trigger events and interactions through code</li>



<li>Build characters, stories, and rules — and see them come to life</li>
</ul>



<p>And perhaps most importantly, you get instant feedback. If your code doesn’t quite work, you’ll know right away, and you’ll have the chance to fix it, test it, and improve it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Three fun game projects to try today</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve created a free library of step-by-step game projects that work in a browser, that require no previous experience, and that let imagination lead the way.</p>



<p>Here are three brilliant beginner-friendly projects to try at Code Club or at home:</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What does the community think?</strong></h2>



<p>Games are a great starting point because they’re naturally motivating: young people <em>see</em> what they’ve made work, and that’s incredibly empowering.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I started with ‘Catch the dots’. I changed the sprite to a spaceship and then added power-ups and space cats. Now I’m making my own levels!”<br>&#8211; <strong>Lila, 11</strong>, Creator</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“When my son made his first Scratch game, it was the first time he explained what a loop was to me. Games build confidence.”<br>&#8211; <strong>Laura</strong>, parent and Code Club Mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Games are a great starting point because they’re naturally motivating. Young people <em>see</em> what they’ve made work, and that’s incredibly empowering.”<br>&#8211; <strong>Marc Scott</strong>, Senior Learning Manager</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Build, remix, and level up</strong></h2>



<p>Once you’ve finished a project, the real fun begins. With just a few changes, creators can build their own levels or make the game more challenging, design custom characters and backdrops, or invent brand new rules and mechanics.</p>

<p>Creating a computer program involves many different skills — knowing how to code is just one part. When we teach programming to young people, we want to guide them to learn these skills in a structured way. The &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework is a great tool for doing that. This blog describes how using the framework will benefit you and your learners in the computing classroom.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning to program: Everything at once?</h2>



<p>Creating a program from the ground up can be daunting, especially for new learners. Without support, they’ll likely get stuck sooner or later; programs rarely work the first time round. And the more complex the problem that a program is addressing, the more likely it is that the first version of the program won’t work.</p>

<p>One reason that learning to program can be challenging is that it involves understanding a lot of specific concepts and applying many varied skills. From early on in their learning journey, young people need to have a firm grasp of concepts such as repetition, selection, variables, and functions. Also fundamental to learning to program well is the skill of abstraction: understanding a task and identifying which details are relevant and which can be ignored.</p>



<p>To get to grips with all these different concepts and skills, young people need structure — otherwise they’ll try to hold everything in their head at once, and likely feel overwhelmed by the <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive load</a>. This sort of experience may cause them to disengage instead of persisting. They may even decide that programming is not for them.</p>



<p>In light of these challenges, the &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework is a great tool for teaching.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The benefits of the &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework</h2>



<p>The framework breaks programming down into four levels, each focusing on a different aspect of creating a program:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Problem: Analysing the problem or task the program should address, to understand and record the requirements.</li>



<li>Design: Turning the analysis into an algorithm — a set of steps for the computer to follow to create the desired output. This can involve flowcharts or storyboards, but importantly no code.</li>



<li>Code: Developing the code based on the design (and building the physical components if any are involved).</li>



<li>Running the code: Testing the code, checking outputs, and debugging where necessary.</li>
</ul>



<p>Throughout the processes of developing a program, learners (and professional programmers) move between these levels as they implement their designs and debug them, sometimes even returning to the problem level if more analysis or clarification is needed.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/BARROWHILL_CC4422CV031319-4.jpg" alt="Young child in the classroom using Scratch to program." class="wp-image-90539" style="width:720px"/></figure></div>


<p>Potential benefits of the &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework for teachers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It helps you break down the activity of programming into discrete parts.</li>



<li>It helps you engage your learners, as you can show them that programming involves more than knowing how to code.</li>



<li>If your learners get stuck with their programming, the framework can help you guide them to a solution.</li>
</ul>



<p>Potential benefits for learners:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The framework will help them think through all the steps needed to create a program that works, and practise their problem-solving skills and analytical thinking.</li>



<li>They will more readily see how programming connects to their world — at the problem level — and find aspects of programming where they have strengths and can use their creativity.</li>



<li>They will gain a stronger idea of how software is built in the tech sector.</li>
</ul>



<p>Our new Quick Read shares tips on how to best use the framework in your teaching.</p>

</div>



<p>Things to aim for when using the framework with your learners:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Be aware of what level they are working at and when it&#8217;s time to switch to a different one.</li>



<li>Understand that, when they encounter an issue with their program, they can step back and use the framework to figure out where the issue comes from. The issue might be a bug in the code, the algorithm not working as intended, or a description of the problem not taking into account something important.</li>
</ul>



<p>We hope you find the framework useful. If you have ideas for how to use it in your teaching, why not share them in the comments?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Teaching programming: The wider context</h2>



<p>When following the ‘levels of abstraction’ approach, learners need to explain how programs work and debug them. That means program comprehension is a key skill here. You may have already helped your learners to develop and practise this skill, for example with <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the PRIMM approach</a>. <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Block Model</a> is another useful tool for helping your learners talk about various aspects of a program. And if you use the <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pair programming approach</a> in programming activities, your learners can improve their program comprehension by talking about their code with each other.

<p>And what about generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools for programmers? In the age of AI, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-kids-still-need-to-learn-to-code-in-the-age-of-ai/">we think young people still need to learn to code</a> because it empowers them to navigate and think critically about all digital technologies, including AI. And while generative AI tools can help a skilled programmer create quality code more quickly, more research is needed to show whether such tools help school-age young people build their understanding as they learn to code. You can see some of the great work being done in this area if you <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research/seminars/previous/programming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">catch up with our 2024 research seminar series</a>.</p>



<p>The &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework is useful in your teaching no matter what tools young people use to create programs. Even with an AI tool, they will still need to work at all four levels of abstraction to program effectively.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>This blog post is written by Victor Murithi, Communications and Media Consultant at Young Scientists Kenya, one of our global partners for Experience AI in Kenya.</em></p>



<p>When over 100 teachers from across Kenya gathered at Kangaru High School in Embu County for the Kenya Science and Engineering Fair Nationals in April, few anticipated just how transformative a two-day workshop could be. Delivered by the Experience AI Young Scientists Kenya (YSK) team, with support from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, the training sparked more than curiosity — it sparked a shift in mindset.</p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t just about introducing new tools: it was about empowering teachers to confidently lead their students into an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven future.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1066" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image.jpeg" alt="Students in a classroom learn about Experience AI." class="wp-image-90526" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image.jpeg 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-900x600.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>National reach and local impact</strong></h2>



<p>What began as a plan to train just 40 teachers quickly grew into something much bigger. By the time the workshop kicked off, 104 teachers from over 80 schools across 37 counties in Kenya, had registered and participated — nearly tripling the initial target.</p>



<p>This overwhelming interest confirmed a powerful insight: teachers are eager to understand AI, not only to better prepare their students for the future, but also for their own professional growth.</p>



<p>The workshop’s curriculum didn’t just focus on technical skills, it aimed to create confidence, clarity, and community among the attendees — key ingredients for successfully integrating AI into teaching and learning.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Helping teachers move past their fear of AI and understand its potential is incredibly powerful. Because AI is the future, and through this training, we’re reaching the minds that will shape it,” explained Lucy Mwaniki, AI Community Trainer at YSK.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical skills, real outcomes</strong></h2>



<p>As part of the training, the attendees completed interactive worksheets, tested basic machine learning models, and sat a final comprehension test, something they found both validating and motivational.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We were able to do the summative test… which turned out to be a very effective way of us understanding how in-depth and how well they grasped the knowledge,” says Lucy Mwaniki<em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>In one standout session, teachers collaboratively brainstormed ways AI could address national educational challenges. Ideas included models to assist students in selecting academic pathways within Kenya’s Competency Based Curriculum (CBC). Several teachers also successfully built working models, demonstrating the potential of applied learning.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It was a very eye-opening session… some of the teachers were able to create a very basic model, which was a wonderful experience for them,” Lucy Mwaniki<strong> </strong>explains.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>What made this training exceptional was its immediate applicability and long-term vision. By the end of two days, teachers weren&#8217;t just AI-aware — they were AI-ready, with many already starting to explore how AI tools could support entrepreneurship, lesson planning, and personalised learning pathways.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1496" height="1496" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1.jpeg" alt="Students in a classroom setting; two of them are using a laptop to learn about AI." class="wp-image-90527" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1.jpeg 1496w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-250x250.jpeg 250w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-500x500.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-450x450.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-900x900.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1496px) 100vw, 1496px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Celebrating our achievements and impact&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>At the close of the training, each teacher received a Certificate of Participation, recognising their commitment to professional development and their new capacity to bring AI into the classroom. The awarding of certificates added a sense of accomplishment and pride, reinforcing that teachers are key drivers of technological transformation in education.</p>



<p>And the impact of the training was measurable:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>95% of teachers agreed that the training increased their knowledge and confidence to teach AI concepts</strong></li>



<li><strong>88% of teachers agreed that the training was high quality and useful for preparing them to teach the Experience AI lessons</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>But it doesn’t end there, as Vanessa Inziani, Head of Programs at YSK, explains, “Our commitment doesn’t end with the training — we continue to support educators with resources, mentorship, and follow-up to ensure success in delivering the program in the classroom.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking ahead towards a promising AI journey</strong></h2>



<p>With the rapidly evolving digital landscape, AI is no longer a distant concept — it’s a present-day classroom necessity. Yet, introducing AI into schools isn’t just about technical literacy; it’s about confidence, clarity, and community and the approach the Young Scientist Kenya team and Experience AI delivered during the two-day training is anchored in this belief.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As AI continues to shape the global education landscape, programs like Experience AI provide the bridge needed to equip teachers, inspire students, and future-proof education systems. The Kangaru High School session was not a one-off — it was a catalyst for systemic change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experience AI is scaling. As it expands across Kenya and beyond, the benefits are clear:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Empowered educators</strong> who gain confidence and skills to integrate AI in their teaching</li>



<li><strong>Future-ready students</strong> who grasp foundational AI concepts and their real-world applications</li>



<li><strong>Sustainable impact</strong> as trained teachers go on to influence thousands of learners in their communities</li>
</ul>



<p>The journey from fear to fluency starts with a single step, a willingness for us all to explore what’s possible. Together, we can equip educators, inspire students, and shape Kenya’s future, one AI-literate classroom at a time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>About Experience AI</em></strong></h2>



<p><em>Experience AI is an AI literacy programme, co-developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Google DeepMind, that teaches students aged 11 to 14 about AI and machine learning.

<p>In our April research seminar, David Weintrop, Rotem Israel-Fishelson, and Peter Moon from the University of Maryland introduced <a href="https://apicancode.umd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">API Can Code</a>, a data science curriculum designed with high school students for high school students. Their talk explored how their innovative work uses real-world data and students&#8217; own experiences and interests to create meaningful, authentic learning experiences in data science.</p>



<p><strong><em>Quick note for educators</em></strong>: Are you interested in joining our free, exploratory data science education workshop for teachers on 10 July 2025 in Cambridge, UK? Then <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/join-our-free-data-science-education-workshop-for-teachers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find out the details here</a>.</p>



<p>David started by explaining the motivation behind the API Can Code project. The team’s goal was not to turn students into future data scientists, but to offer students the data literacy they need to explore and critically engage with a data-driven world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The work was also guided by a shared view among leading teachers’ organisations that data science should be taught across all subjects in the K–12 curriculum. It also draws on strong research showing that when educational experiences connect with students’ own lives and interests, it leads to deeper engagement and better learning outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reviewing the landscape</strong></h2>



<p>To prepare for the design of the curriculum, David, Rotem, and Peter wanted to understand what data science education options already exist for K–12 students. Rotem described how they compared four major K–12 data science curricula and examined different aspects, such as the topics they covered and the datasets they used. Their findings showed that many datasets were quite small in size, and that the datasets used were not always about topics that students were interested in.</p>

<p>The team also looked at 30 data science tools used across different K–12 platforms and analysed what each could do. They found that tools varied in how effective they were and that many lacked accessibility features to support students with diverse learning needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This analysis helped to refine the team&#8217;s objective: to create a data science curriculum that students find interesting and that is informed by their values and voices.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Participatory design</strong></h2>



<p>To work towards this goal, the team used a methodology called participatory design<em>. </em>This is an approach that actively involves the end users — in this case, high school students — in the design process. During several in-person sessions with 28 students aged 15 to 18 years old, the researchers facilitated low-tech, hands-on activities exploring the students’ identities and interests and how they think about data.</p>



<p>One activity, Empathy Map, involved students working together to create a persona representing a student in their school. They were asked to describe the persona’s daily life, interests, and concerns about technology and data:</p>

<p>The students’ involvement in the design process gave the team a better understanding of young people’s views and interests, which helped create the design of the API Can Code curriculum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>API Can Code: three units, three key tools</strong></h2>



<p>Peter provided an overview of the API Can Code curriculum. It follows a three-unit flow covering different concepts and tools in each unit:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Unit 1</strong> introduces students to different types of data and data science terminology. The unit explores the role of data in the students’ daily lives, how use and misuse of data can affect them, different ways of collecting and presenting data, and how to evaluate databases for aspects such as size, recency, and trustworthiness. It also introduces them to <a href="https://rapidapi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>RapidAPI</em></strong></a>, a hub that connects to a wide range of APIs from different providers, allowing students to access real-world data such as Zillow housing prices or Spotify music data.</li>



<li><strong>Unit 2 </strong>covers the computing skills used in data science, including the use of programming tools to run efficient data science techniques. Students learn to use <a href="https://edublocks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>EduBlocks</em></strong></a><strong>, </strong>a block-based programming environment where students can draw in JSON files from RapidAPI datasets, and process and filter data without needing a lot of text-based programming skills. The students also compare this approach with manual data processing, which they discover is very slow.</li>



<li><strong>Unit 3 </strong>focuses on data analysis, visualisation, and interpretation. Students use <a href="https://codap.concord.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>CODAP</em></strong></a>, a web-based interactive data science tool, to calculate summary statistics, create graphs, and perform analyses. CODAP is a user-friendly but powerful platform, making it perfect for students to analyse and visualise their data sets. Students also practise interpreting pre-made graphs and the graphs and statistics that they are creating.</li>
</ol>



<p>Peter described an example activity carried out by the students, showing how these three units flow together and build both technical skills and an understanding of the real-world uses of data science. Students were tasked with analysing a dataset from Zillow, a property website, to explore the question “How much does a house in my neighbourhood cost?” The images below show the process the students followed, which uses the data science skills and tools from all three units of the curriculum.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Interest-driven learning in action</strong></h2>



<p>A central tenet of API Can Code is that students should explore data that matters to them. A diverse range of student interests was identified during the design work, and the curriculum uses these areas of interest, such as music, movies, sports, and animals, throughout the lessons.</p>



<p>The curriculum also features an open-ended final project, where students can choose a research question that is important to them and their lives, and answer it using data science skills.</p>



<p>The team shared two examples of memorable final projects. In one, a student set out to answer the question “Is Jhené Aiko a star?” The student found a publicly available dataset through an API provided by Deezer, a music streaming platform. She wrote a program that retrieved data on the artist’s longevity and collaborations, analysed the data, and concluded that Aiko is indeed a star. What stood out about this project wasn’t just the fact that the student independently defined stardom and answered their research question using real data, but that this was a truly personal, interest-driven project. David noted that the researchers could never have come up with this activity, since they had never previously heard of Jhené Aiko!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1060" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9.png" alt="Jhené Aiko, an R&amp;B singer-songwriter" class="wp-image-90480" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9.png 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-300x199.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-500x331.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-768x509.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-1536x1018.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-800x530.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-450x298.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-900x596.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Jhené Aiko, an R&amp;B singer-songwriter&nbsp;</em><br><em>(Photo by Charito Yap, licensed under </em><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>CC BY-ND 2.0</em></a><em>)</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Another student’s project analysed data about housing in Washington DC to answer the question “Which ward in DC has the most affordable houses?” Rotem explained that this student was motivated by her family thinking about moving away from the city. She wanted to use her project to persuade her parents to stay by identifying the most affordable ward in DC that they could move to. She was excited by the outcome of her project, and she presented her findings to other students and her parents.</p>



<p>These projects underscore the power of personally important data science projects driven by students’ interests. When students care about the questions they are exploring, they&#8217;re more invested in the process and more likely to keep using the skills and concepts they learn.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resources</strong></h2>



<p>API Can Code is available online and completely free to use. Teachers can access lesson plans, tutorial videos, assessment rubrics, and more from the curriculum’s website <a href="https://apicancode.umd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://apicancode.umd.edu/</a>.

<p>The European Astro Pi Challenge is an ESA Education project run in collaboration with us here at the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It offers young people the amazing opportunity to conduct scientific investigations in space by writing computer programs that run on Raspberry Pi computers on board the ISS, called Astro Pis.</p>



<p>There‘s a lot to celebrate from this year’s Astro Pi, so let’s take a look at some of the highlights for each of our inspiring Missions: Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mission Zero: Inspiring coding, creativity, and inclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Mission Zero reached more young people than ever before in 2024/25, with 25,405 young people participating in 17,285 teams. After passing the rigorous testing and moderation processes, an amazing 17,109 teams (25,210 young people) were successful in getting their programs to run on the ISS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the great things about Mission Zero is that we see a good gender balance in participation. This year, 44% of participants identified as “female” and 4% as “prefer to self-describe”, “prefer not to say”, or “other”. This means that Mission Zero has achieved a more balanced gender representation than is typically seen in computing subjects, where the ratio is around 20:80 girls to boys.</p>

<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mission Space Lab: More teams have their programs run in space</strong></h2>



<p>Mission Space Lab gives young people the opportunity to calculate the speed of the ISS in orbit using sensor and camera data collected from the Astro Pis on board the ISS. This year, 1859 young people in 552 teams participated in Mission Space Lab. Notably, 309 Mission Space Lab teams, or 95% of submissions, ran their programs on the ISS and are now analysing the data they collected. That’s 73 more teams achieving flight status than in 2023/24, and a total of 1084 young people receiving unique data sets from space and certificates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Running a program in space is very different from testing it on the ground. It’s always interesting to see how well your program has performed and how accurate the final output is. Below, you can see a scatter graph of the team estimates produced by their programs. The actual speed of the ISS is no secret: it’s travelling about 7.67 kilometres per second. How have teams performed with the ISS speed task?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inspiring and impactful</strong></h2>



<p>Another highlight from this year has been seeing how impactful participation can be for young people and mentors facilitating the activity. We receive lots of valuable feedback from the Astro Pi community each year, and it’s always heartwarming to hear what your experience has been and how we can improve the challenge. Here are a couple of quotes from the community who took part this year:</p>



<p>Mission Zero mentor: <em>“Having their programs run in space really motivated them to take part because it was an exciting reward and something they wanted to talk about with their friends.”</em></p>



<p>Parent of a Mission Zero participant: <em>“I was completely inexperienced in Python, but easily managed to help my 7-year-old.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More Code Clubs participating in 2024/25</strong></h2>



<p>It has been great to see lots of Code Clubs taking part in Astro Pi this year, both for Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab. This year, 986 young people from 700 teams did Mission Zero at their Code Club: that’s double the number from 2023/24. Plus, 43 Mission Space Lab teams from Code Clubs took part. That’s 143 young people, or almost double the number compared to the year before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We ran two code-alongs for the Code Club community this year, and it is encouraging to see increases for both missions. We will continue to support young people from all settings who want to take part in Astro Pi next year, whether it’s at school, Code Club, or other venues.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>In summary, it’s been a great year for Astro Pi. We’ve reached lots of young people through the challenge, met many inspiring mentors, and seen some really positive trends. Plus, all the operations on the space station that make Astro Pi possible went smoothly: when you are running programs in space, that isn’t always the case!&nbsp;</p>



<p>None of it would have been possible without the tireless efforts of the teachers, mentors, and educators who help run Astro Pi in your communities. From everyone here at Mission Control, thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’d like to tell us how we can provide more support to help you run Astro Pi, please email <a href="mailto:contact@astro-pi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact@astro-pi.org</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll be back for more stellar space adventures in coding in September 2025.</p>

<p>Code Club is a global movement of free coding clubs where school-aged young people — called creators — develop the confidence to create with digital technologies. Code Clubs take place in schools and community venues like youth clubs, libraries, and maker spaces and are run by teachers, educators, and volunteers from all walks of life — known as mentors. These incredible mentors make Code Clubs possible and we are so grateful for their hard work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>About the 2025 survey report</strong></h2>



<p>This Code Club annual survey report presents key responses from 775 mentors gathered via surveys and feedback from partners.</p>



<p>This year, <strong>7,494</strong> Code Clubs have confirmed they have been active in the last two years, with clubs in 102 countries. We estimate 257,000 creators are involved in clubs and 43% of creators are female. As one UK Code Club mentor put it: &#8220;Girls who didn&#8217;t think it was for them now have confidence&#8221;.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Code Clubs have a positive impact on young creators</strong></h2>



<p>In 2024, an <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/how-fun-filled-code-clubs-drive-learning-new-evidence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">independent evaluation</a> by the Durham University Evidence Centre for Education provided evidence of positive outcomes for young people attending Code Clubs. We are continuing to build on this evidence, with 96% of mentors responding to our surveys agreeing that creators have increased skills in computing and digital making, as well as increased confidence to engage with technology as a result of attending a Code Club.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few of the examples mentors gave of the impact Code Club has on creators:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Confidence:</strong> &#8220;[Creators become] more confident using technology and making friends. Some really come out of their shell compared to when they started.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, UK&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Skill development:</strong> “They come into the club with no coding skills (some barely know how to use a computer) and leave as competent, literate, coders.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, Canada</li>



<li><strong>Enjoyment:</strong> &#8220;One of our core principles is that coding should be fun&#8230; we give them creative ways to expand on the task. They learn to push themselves a bit beyond a task, and look for more things.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, the Netherlands&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Social skills:</strong> &#8220;One great outcome has been the socialization that occurs. Kids in our club are definitely making friendships and improving their soft skills.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, USA&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Continued participation: </strong>&#8220;It has increased their passion for tech and how to create new things to solve problems.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, Ghana</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Increasing access to technology</strong></h2>



<p>Code Club also plays an important role in increasing access to technology for creators who would otherwise not have access. We work with partners across the world to run clubs in areas of educational disadvantage to ensure that Code Clubs are available to creators from all backgrounds to address this need.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>In some regions, Code Club provides creators with their first significant encounter with digital making. A mentor <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/global-impact-empowering-young-people-in-kenya-and-south-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in Kenya</a> told us that Code Club ensured that creators in his area were not “left behind”. A Code Club mentor in Tunisia told us&nbsp; “[&#8230;] access to coding is very limited, our club contributes to reducing this inequality”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>
