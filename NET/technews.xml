<p>For the last five years, once a month, we have hosted an online seminar sharing computing education research. Seminars are organised as usually year-long series with changing themes. In 2025, for example, our theme was <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research/seminars/previous/teaching-about-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8216;Teaching about AI and data science&#8217;</a>. In 2024, it was <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research/seminars/previous/programming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8216;Teaching programming (with or without AI)&#8217;</a>.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that for the last few years our focus has been on AI technology, and for 2026 we will continue this. But we will shift from showcasing how computing education research is changing teaching and learning in computing lessons, to showcasing how computing education research in other disciplines, such as art or geography, is starting to include teaching about AI. For example, art lessons may change so that learners find out how professional artists are using AI tools to create arts. Or geography lessons may change so that learners discover how professional geographers are using AI to make predictions about physical or human aspects of geography, such as volcanic activity and global warming.</p>



<p>Our series for 2026 is called <strong>&#8216;Applied AI&#8217;</strong>. This title recognises that AI technology is applied across contexts, across careers, across disciplines, and this means what we teach across school subjects will change.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Encouraging a pull from disciplines, rather than a push from computer science</h2>



<p>The majority of resources and professional development material related to teaching about AI have been developed by the computer science community. For example, we have developed the popular <a href="https://experience-ai.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI</a> resources in collaboration with Google DeepMind. In these resources, the contexts were carefully selected to represent real-world examples across disciplines, and to to enable the teaching of particular technical or social and ethical concepts. This could be described as &#8220;a push&#8221; of content from computing towards other disciplines. For example, to enable teaching about the ethical issues around plagiarism, an art context is used in the Experience AI resources; to enable teaching about the potential benefits of using AI tools, an ecological geography context is used.</p>

<p>AI applications are always situated within a particular topic. Most current AI applications are data-driven: vast amounts of data are collected and processed to produce models that can then either be used to generate outputs or make predictions. For example, data about artworks can be collected and used to train a model for generating outputs similar to the artworks; this is an application of AI in the art discipline. Or data on wild fires can be collected and used to train a model for making predictions about current or prospective fires; this is an application of AI in the geography discipline.</p>

</div>


<p>In reality, the best people to recognise how AI technology is being applied in a discipline and what students in that discipline should be taught about these applications are the people working in the discipline, for example the art and geography teachers. Computer science educators can work to build the technical understanding and the general social and ethical understanding that is common across applications. But the detail of how AI technology is changing a discipline can only truly be understood by the respective community, by the artists and art educators, by the geographers and the geography educators.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">An emerging focus</h2>



<p>At present, though, most educators are grappling with how they can use AI tools for productivity, such as creating lesson plans, or answering emails. Or they are looking at how they can use AI for general teaching and learning, for example for personalisation, say for students with additional needs. The idea that their underpinning discipline is changing is, perhaps, not yet on teachers&#8217; radar. But at universities, such as in undergraduate courses, and in the world of work, education and training are changing. Data science courses are now being offered across faculties, including science, geography, language, and art faculties. These changes will start to filter down to school-based education via curriculum change. While some resources and professional development materials addressing this shift are already becoming available, change is still fragile and patchy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Raising awareness, building community and a common language</h2>



<p>The aims of our Applied AI research seminar series in 2026 are to start to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Raise awareness of the forthcoming changes that applying AI will bring to disciplines</li>



<li>Build a cross-discipline community</li>



<li>Think about a common language that could be used across disciplines</li>
</ul>



<p>If we can start to agree on what common concepts could be taught in the arts, sciences and humanities, it gives us a better chance to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Understand how to use AI as it is applied in different disciplines</li>



<li>Help students to build useful mental models and develop the agency and critical thinking skills they need to evaluate these applications and decide when and how to use them and how far to trust them</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">We need your help</h2>



<p>To make our 2026 series a success, we need to spread the word about our seminars to groups of educators, researchers, industry and policy makers across the arts, sciences, and humanities.</p>

<p>The podcast is framed around three major themes that defined 2025: data science, AI literacy, and digital literacy, all of which continue to play an increasingly important role in education systems worldwide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking back at 2025</strong></h2>



<p>In the podcast, Rehana reflects on a year characterised by research, collaboration, and community, highlighting the importance of global partnerships in <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-recognition-unesco/">developing and localising AI literacy resources for diverse educational contexts</a>.</p>



<p>From a research perspective, Bobby explains that 2025 was about pulling together what we already know and making sense of it, to better understand <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/what-should-be-included-in-a-data-science-curriculum-for-schools/">what good data science education should look like</a>, including curriculum design, pedagogy, and appropriate tools.</p>



<p>Laura focuses on resilience and creativity in computing education, as well as the growing presence of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/how-ai-shapes-your-feed-an-explainable-social-media-simulator-for-the-classroom/">more personalised forms of artificial intelligence</a>, which present both significant opportunities and complex ethical challenges.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1500" height="1999" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2.jpg" alt="The new set!" class="wp-image-92157" style="width:500px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2.jpg 1500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-188x250.jpg 188w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-500x666.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-768x1023.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-1153x1536.jpg 1153w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-800x1066.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-450x600.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image2-900x1199.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>A key concern raised throughout the episode is the risk of cognitive offloading, whereby learners rely on AI tools to bypass critical thinking processes. The speakers emphasise the need for <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-our-new-programming-with-ai-unit/">learning experiences and assessments that value process, reasoning, and reflection</a> rather than solely final outputs.</p>



<p>The episode also examines barriers to the adoption of computing and AI education, including teacher confidence, limited access to devices, restrictive school IT policies, and the need for <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/localising-ai-education-adapting-experience-ai-resources/">translated and localised resources</a>.</p>



<p>Contributions from our colleagues around the world highlight stark contrasts in educational contexts, with challenges such as funding constraints, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/adapting-our-computing-curriculum-resources-for-kenya-the-journey-so-far/">connectivity issues, and teacher training needs</a>, alongside examples of innovation where educators are adequately supported.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s ahead</strong></h2>

<p>In this blog, we share the new <strong>data paradigms framework</strong> that we have developed through research and used to help improve our understanding about how to teach and learn about AI and data science. We also invite you to register your interest in participating in our next collaborative study on the topic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Knowledge-based approaches to systems design</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s start by highlighting an important distinction between different approaches to designing systems. In a <strong>knowledge-based</strong> approach to system design, a set of rules (e.g., if-then statements) are written for the system to execute. Every rule is explicitly defined. This approach is called &#8216;rule-based&#8217;, &#8216;symbolic&#8217;, or &#8216;logic-based&#8217;. For example, a developer could create a program that simulates dialogue by writing specific lines of code to handle a greeting, such as “IF user says &#8220;Hello&#8221; THEN output &#8220;Hi!&#8221;. If the user types &#8220;Greetings!&#8221; instead, the program fails because it has no rule for that specific word. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="651" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025.jpg" alt="An educator helps students with a coding task." class="wp-image-89708" style="width:700px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-500x326.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-800x521.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-450x293.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-900x586.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>Knowledge-based models are often said to be explainable by design. This means the logic is accessible and interpretable and developers can trace the exact steps taken to produce an output. For example, if developers manually classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative using a pre-defined set of criteria, the rules their restaurant classifying system follows are entirely explicit, and the path from input to output is clear and explainable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Data-driven approaches to systems design</h2>



<p>By contrast, in a <strong>data-driven</strong> approach to system design developers do not write specific rules. Instead, they collect lots of data and train a model. In the dialogue simulator example, they would collect hundreds of examples of greetings and train a model to the pattern of a greeting. If the user types &#8220;Greetings!&#8221;, the system generates a response based on the patterns in its training data.</p>

<p>Data-driven models are often opaque. In other words, the internal workings of these ML models are hidden. While we can see our input and the system&#8217;s output, the internal mathematical process is so complex — often involving layers of calculations and abstractions — that we cannot simply “explain” why a specific output was produced. For example, developers can create a classification model by training a neural network using thousands of images. Due to the large quantity of data used to train the model, and complex internal parameters and hidden layers, developers and users of the system cannot understand or explain the logic or features that lead to a specific output. These kinds of models are often referred to as a “black box” (as opposed to a “glass” or “clear” box).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Comparing knowledge-based and data-driven approaches</h2>



<p>Researchers have argued that the move from knowledge-based (or rule-based) programming to data-driven system design represents a paradigm shift and creates unique challenges for educators. The challenge is helping students shift from the expectation that a system produces a single &#8216;right&#8217; answer — characteristic of traditional rule-based programming — toward an understanding that systems trained on large quantities of data produce outcomes that aren&#8217;t always fixed or explainable. If the current instruction in the classroom still relies heavily on traditional rule-based programming approaches, we might be setting students up for misconceptions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Data paradigms: A framework for analysing data science education approaches</h2>



<p>In our <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/projects/data-science-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research work on AI and data science at the Raspberry Pi Computing Education Research Centre</a>, we analysed 84 research studies about the teaching and learning of data science. We categorised learning activities used in the studies to understand whether they were (i) knowledge-based or data-driven, and (ii) the extent to which the underlying models used were transparent or opaque. This led us to define four distinct <strong>data paradigms</strong>:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1999" height="1031" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1.png" alt="The data paradigms framework" class="wp-image-92176" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1.png 1999w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-300x155.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-500x258.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-768x396.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-1536x792.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-800x413.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-450x232.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2026/01/image1-900x464.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The data paradigms framework</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Knowledge-based and transparent (KB + T): </strong>Activities in this paradigm are ones where students write rules for systems, or work with systems that use rules, where the logic is fully explainable by design. For example, if students manually classify data (e.g. creating simple &#8216;if-then&#8217; statements to predict an outcome), the path from input to output is clear.</li>



<li><strong>Data-driven + Transparent (DD + T): </strong>In this paradigm, activities involve students working with models trained on data, but the trained model&#8217;s logic remains explainable and interpretable. For example these could be models using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to group data points based on proximity, or using linear regression to predict a trend. Even though the model produces an output, the student can look at the inner workings of the model and see how the decision is made.</li>



<li><strong>Data-driven + Opaque (DD + O): </strong>This paradigm&#8217;s activities require students to work with data-driven ML models where the models&#8217; internal logic is hidden, for example an image classification model using a type of neural network (e.g. CNN). The model produces an output (e.g. classifying an image as &#8216;This is a dog&#8217;), but the student cannot inspect the system to find a rule or clear path explaining why that specific output was produced. To understand these systems, it&#8217;s necessary to use additional testing and evaluation tools.</li>



<li><strong>Knowledge-based + Opaque (KB + O): </strong>Activities in this paradigm would involve systems with human-written rules that are not explainable. In our review of K–12 activities, we found no examples of activities within this paradigm.</li>
</ol>



<p>The data paradigms framework helps us to distinguish between different kinds of modeling activities students take part in and how instructional approaches could be classified across one or more paradigms. For instance, we found that most data-driven activities were also opaque (<strong>DD + O</strong>), usually meaning that students collected and used data to train a model, but how the system worked was opaque. This pattern, where the data is visible but the model is not explainable, risks students forming misconceptions about the capabilities and limitations of data-driven systems. Without understanding how outputs are generated, students may expect data-driven ML systems to operate like fully explainable (or transparent) ones.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="560" height="373" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/07/Hills-Road-Dojo_Low-res_22-01-23-24.jpg" alt="Learners at a Code Club." class="wp-image-84606" style="width:698px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/07/Hills-Road-Dojo_Low-res_22-01-23-24.jpg 560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/07/Hills-Road-Dojo_Low-res_22-01-23-24-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/07/Hills-Road-Dojo_Low-res_22-01-23-24-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/07/Hills-Road-Dojo_Low-res_22-01-23-24-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>We think that lessons are needed in the data-driven opaque (DD + O) quadrant to explicitly teach students about how data-driven systems work and the role they play in everyday contexts. However, when teaching data-driven opaque (DD + O) activities, learners&#8217; attention needs to be directed to concepts such as model confidence, data quality, and model evaluation. Since an ML model is not inherently explainable, we need to teach students to use post-hoc explanation methods, such as testing different inputs to see how a system&#8217;s output changes. To prepare students for this learning experience, we think that first introducing activities about rule-based systems (knowledge-based + transparent; <strong>KB + T</strong>) or simple data exploration, such as linear regression or data visualisation (data-driven + transparent; <strong>DD + T</strong>) may serve as a ‘bridge’ to understanding data-driven modeling by helping students to distinguish between systems built from specific logical rules and systems trained on data.</p>



<p>We believe the idea of data paradigms can serve as a way of framing teaching activities about data science and help educators and students to consider the transition between different paradigms when engaging with the systems we interact with every day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Teachers in England, participate in our new study</h2>



<p>We’re launching a new study to explore how to teach learners aged 9 to 11 about data-driven computing. The study will take place in collaboration with <strong>upper key stage 2 teachers in England </strong>and look at:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>What key ideas pupils need to understand</li>



<li>How teachers currently approach topics related to data-driven computing</li>



<li>How pupils make sense of data and probability</li>
</ul>



<p>Our goal is to find practical ways to help teachers build children’s confidence in working with data in computing lessons. The study will be collaborative, with two workshops held throughout 2026, and we’re inviting upper KS2 teachers in England to take part.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bridging the gap in programming education</h2>



<p>As India is accelerating its efforts to modernise digital and computing education, it&#8217;s the ideal place for us to test how best to introduce learners to AI-assisted approaches to programming and teach them responsible AI use.</p>



<p>We decided to design a &#8216;Programming with AI’ unit of eight lessons that support students aged 14–16 to progress from block-based programming to text-based Python programming, Python being one of the most widely employed programming languages in industry and academia. In the new unit, students are guided to use LLM-based tools safely, ethically, and responsibly in order to undertake data analysis projects in Python. Students learn how to use the tools, such as Gemini and ChatGPT, to deepen their understanding, experiment with ideas, and connect classroom concepts with real-world technological applications.</p>

<p>The &#8216;Programming with AI’ unit is currently being piloted across five residential schools under our partner, the Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society. In the coming months, we will evaluate the impact of this AI-supported approach to learning programming on student engagement, motivation, and overall learning outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Key design decisions during unit development</h2>



<p>During the design phase of the unit, we identified three main challenges we wanted to address:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The first was the transition from block-based to text-based coding. The students we were designing for are familiar with block-based programming like Scratch, but Python needs precisely typed code (syntax). This is a huge shift, and we wanted to offer a way to bridge the gap.</li>



<li>We also had to figure out how to teach prompting LLM tools to students who are learning English as their second language.</li>



<li>Finally, LLMs are non-deterministic. This means that LLM tools don’t always produce the same output, even when given the same prompt. They also do not generate correct code consistently.</li>
</ol>



<p>To solve the first problem, we decided that the initial lessons in the unit should start by showing familiar Scratch blocks right next to the equivalent Python syntax. This direct comparison makes the transition from block-based to text-based programmer smoother.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1608" height="350" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image6.png" alt="Comparison of Python syntax with equivalent Scratch block" class="wp-image-92117" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image6.png 1608w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image6-300x65.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image6-500x109.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image6-768x167.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image6-1536x334.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image6-800x174.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image6-450x98.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image6-900x196.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1608px) 100vw, 1608px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Comparison of Python syntax with equivalent Scratch block</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>To teach prompting, we built a gradual path. The unit starts with a debugging code activity, where students get code with errors and a prompt to make an LLM tool fix the errors. Later, they learn to break down a prompt into their goal (what output they want) and the context (additional information for the LLM tool). Eventually, they use a structured framework to prompt the tool to generate complete, bug-free code.</p>



<p>Handling the unpredictable outputs of LLM tools we turned into a learning activity. In one lesson, students are given different chatbot-generated code segments and asked to analyse and reflect on the code quality. This crucial exercise helps them build the critical thinking and code evaluation skills they need for programming with AI tools.</p>

</div>


<p>Over the eight lessons, there is a progression of Python concepts and generative AI concepts, as shown in the image above. They lead students to complete two challenging, real-world data analysis projects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preparing the educators</h2>



<p>To ensure the successful pilot of the &#8216;Programming with AI&#8217; unit, a comprehensive teacher training program was essential. We understood that teachers needed confidence and competence not only in the subject matter — programming — but also in guiding students to ethically and effectively use LLM tools.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1182" height="665" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-1.jpg" alt="STEM and ICT teachers participated in the training" class="wp-image-92120" style="width:750px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-1.jpg 1182w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-1-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-1-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-1-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-1-900x506.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1182px) 100vw, 1182px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">STEM and ICT teachers participated in the training</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>The training was an intensive, three-day programme: two days were held in-person for deep collaboration and one day was virtual for reinforcing key information. We covered five critical areas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Hands-on activities to ensure comfort with the Python programming language</li>



<li>Exploring the capabilities and limitations of LLM tools</li>



<li>Effective prompt writing, which teachers would in turn model for their students to use for code debugging and idea generation</li>



<li>Reviewing lesson flow and learning objectives to understand the structure of a lesson</li>



<li>Adapting specific pedagogies to integrate an LLM tool in teaching the Python programming language</li>
</ul>



<p>This training ensured our educators were not just teaching a new unit, but felt like confident facilitators ready to lead the shift towards AI-supported learning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Initial student reactions: Excitement, familiarity with LLM tools, and seamless transition</h2>



<p>The pilot of the &#8216;Programming with AI’ unit began during the second week of December 2025 across five selected schools. It was immediately met with enthusiastic student engagement — they were highly excited to learn Python programming using LLM tools.</p>



<p>When teachers initiated discussions about AI, students demonstrated their familiarity with LLMs, chatbots, and related concepts. They were not only aware of generative AI but could readily name and describe the functions of LLM tools, telling us they were actively using these tools to create projects in various other subjects.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1182" height="665" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-92123" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1.jpg 1182w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-900x506.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1182px) 100vw, 1182px" /></figure>



<p>Students could easily connect with the activities in the lessons as they had foundational understanding of programming, which they developed while learning block-based coding in Scratch. This prior knowledge enabled their seamless transition to the new learning. Perhaps most impressive was the students&#8217; rapid adoption of LLM tools to debug their code. This skill can ease what is traditionally a steep learning curve when students first learn text-based programming.</p>



<p>We are now eagerly anticipating their curiosity and progress in the upcoming lessons.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking ahead and collecting impact data</h2>



<p>With the initial enthusiasm confirmed, the pilot program moves into its next critical phase. Teachers will continue to deliver the unit over the next few months in the five selected schools in Telangana.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1182" height="665" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-2.jpg" alt="STEM and ICT teachers participated in the training" class="wp-image-92122" style="width:760px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-2.jpg 1182w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-2-500x281.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-2-800x450.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-2-450x253.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-2-900x506.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1182px) 100vw, 1182px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The teachers and team at our &#8216;Programming with AI&#8217; training.</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>During this extended observation period, our primary focus will be on rigorous data collection and impact assessment. We will closely monitor how students interact with the provided learning materials and how they use LLM tools throughout the unit. We will systematically assess whether the new teaching approach successfully helps students achieve the defined learning objectives for Python programming. Crucially, we will capture comprehensive data to understand the impact of this AI-integrated approach on engagement, skill acquisition, and problem-solving compared to traditional methods.</p>



<p>Based on the synthesis and analysis of all the gathered data, we will share our gathered insights early next year. The findings will inform our plans for more widely introducing the AI-integrated unit and for developing similar content for other settings and age groups.</p>

<p>Today, we are marking the 10th anniversary of the European Astro Pi Challenge.</p>



<p>At 11:03 on 15 December 2015, former ESA Astronaut Tim Peake launched from Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on a Soyuz rocket as part of his UK Space agency ‘Principia’ mission to the International Space Station (ISS). Two Raspberry Pi-powered Astro Pi Mark 1 computers were waiting for him in the Columbus module of the ISS, ready to be set up for an experimental education activity called “Astro Pi”.</p>

<p>The European Astro Pi Challenge, an ESA Education project run in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and supported by national ESEROs, has been running every year since. The challenge now features two Python coding ‘missions’ that offer young people the amazing opportunity to write a short computer program to send to run on the ISS: Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab.</p>



<p>Tens of thousands of young people participate in Astro Pi annually, reaching over 160,000 participants since 2015. On 15 December this year, Tim Peake and some of the Astro Pi team were at the Science Museum London running Mission Zero workshops for visiting school groups to create their own pixel art programs to send into space.</p>

<p>&#8220;Setting up the Astro Pi computers on the ISS for those first experiments in 2015 was just the beginning of something truly incredible — it’s amazing to see how much impact the programme has had since then! I hope Astro Pi inspires thousands more young people to code, learn about space technology, and feel empowered to reach for the stars in their own careers.&#8221; – Tim Peake, former ESA Astronaut</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Astro Pi 2015–2025: A space odyssey</h2>



<p>As the challenge has matured, its reach has increased, with over 25,000 participants every year since 2021. Young people from all 27 ESA member and associate states have sent their code into space, with 25% of mentors returning to the challenge year after year.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I think Mission Zero is a way of connecting not only to a worldwide group of learners, but also to explorers, future scientists, and future astronauts. To see them as part of a larger community and not just an activity or assignment that they have to do in class. They discover their own abilities and potential, and exercise their creativity in a very low-stakes environment and then to see it come to life in that global way is extremely valuable.” – Mission Zero mentor&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mission Zero has proved to be a great way to engage girls in computing and tech, with an average of 44% of participants identifying as female. This is well above the national averages for other STEM subjects in many countries.</p>



<p>What attracts many teams of young people to Mission Space Lab is the chance to capture data and images from the SenseHats and High Quality Cameras on the Astro Pi computers. This year the Astro Pis will be positioned in the World Observation Research Facility (WORF) window, which means teams can hope for some fantastic, high-quality Earth-observation images with a full field of view. Each team that achieves Flight Status will receive the images and data their program captures.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The next generation of space explorers</h2>



<p>Astro Pi is one of the most inspirational coding activities that young people can do and gives the exciting chance to reach beyond the boundaries of what they may have thought possible. In the 2024–25 impact report, mentors reported that the young people participating were highly motivated by the possibility of having their code run on the ISS.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Honestly, the idea that a kid can send their own code to space is just mind-blowing. It really makes you rethink what ‘possible’ even means.&#8221; – Jeanna, Astro Pi enthusiast</p>

</div>


<p>We are <a href="http://computingeducationresearch.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a research centre based in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge</a>, with a team that spans the university and the Raspberry Pi Foundation. We conduct research into many aspects of the teaching and learning of computing and AI and we work closely with schools, teachers and young people to ensure our research is applicable to practice.</p>



<p>Below I highlight some of the projects we&#8217;ve worked on in the academic year 2024-2025:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Computing Around the World</li>



<li>AI education</li>



<li>Programming education</li>



<li>Physical computing (EPICS project)</li>



<li>Teacher action research (TICE project)</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Computing Around the World</h2>



<p>As I&#8217;ve written on this blog before, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/brookings-report-global-computer-science-education-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">computing education is a global challenge</a>. In one of the Research Centre&#8217;s projects, we are looking at <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/projects/computer-science-education-around-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how computing education is spreading around the world</a>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1180" height="618" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1.png" alt="Computing education in countries around the world" class="wp-image-92069" style="width:766px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1.png 1180w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-300x157.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-500x262.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-768x402.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-800x419.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-450x236.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image1-1-900x471.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1180px) 100vw, 1180px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Computing education in countries around the world.</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>We found that between 2019 and 2024 the number of countries offering computing education had doubled, and that two thirds of all countries now offer, or have concrete plans to offer, computing education. This research has already been highlighted in the <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stanford AI Index</a>, and we are considering repeating the analysis in future years in order to have the most accurate and up-to-date information displayed in our map.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI education</h2>



<p>We have a number of projects in the area of AI education.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Teaching about AI</h3>



<p>We are very interested in how to teach about AI, and held <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/teaching-about-ai-teacher-symposium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a workshop with teachers who were interested in the teaching of AI in February</a>. Following on from the workshop results, we are interviewing more stakeholders, including UK-based experts, teachers and students, about their perspectives on concepts and skills that should be taught as part of an AI curriculum.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1999" height="1333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5.jpg" alt="Notes at our teacher workshop about AI" class="wp-image-92072" style="width:735px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5.jpg 1999w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image5-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Notes at our workshop about AI education.</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>We&#8217;re also researching data science and data ethics education, which are foundational aspects of AI literacy. Most of the current AI systems are data-driven, having been trained on vast amounts of data. Therefore students need to understand about data and data science if they are to learn about AI systems. Therefore we&#8217;ve conducted two detailed literature reviews <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/projects/data-science-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on data science</a> and <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/projects/data-ethics-education/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on data ethics</a> this year. The first of these will be published in March at <a href="https://www.wipsce.org/2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the WiPSCE </a><a href="http://conference.in">conference</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Unplugged AI in Ghana</h3>



<p>One of our PhD students, <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/saa92" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Salomey Addo</a>, has been examining how AI is taught in Ghana, where it is part of the curriculum for young people between ages 12 and 15. This year Salomey published a paper reporting that <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3736181.3747124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghanaian teachers have positive attitudes towards teaching AI but feel unprepared</a> for it. She’s also developed <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CompED-poster.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unplugged resources to teach about artificial neural networks (ANNs)</a>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1080" height="810" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1.jpg" alt="PhD student Salomey explaining how the unplugged resources worked in a teacher PD session in Ghana" class="wp-image-92075" style="width:703px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1.jpg 1080w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image3-1-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">PhD student Salomey explaining how the unplugged resources worked in a teacher PD session in Ghana.</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>ANNs are a fundamental technology used in a variety of AI systems, including image recognition and language translation systems. While ANNs are included in the Ghanaian AI curriculum, Salomey observed that teachers had difficulty with this particular topic The resources she developed are directly inspired by this, and involved teaching <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CompED-poster.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through role play and a board game</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Using AI in learning and teaching computing</h3>



<p>This is an area we’ve also done some research in in the past year.</p>



<p>Carrie Anne Philbin <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3754508.3754513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a paper in September</a> showing that — at least in higher education — much of the use of generative AI in computing education is just duplicating the way teachers might already teach, and is primarily passive from a students’ perspective.</p>



<p>Meanwhile Katharine Childs and Veronica Cucuiat have been looking at <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/projects/teaching-programming-with-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how large language models (LLMs) can support secondary school programming education</a> by helping students understand programming error messages.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Programming education: Learning to debug</h2>



<p>Text-based programming is a topic featured in many computing curricula around the world. Teachers and researchers know that younger learners, for example at the lower secondary school level, can find debugging text-based programs very challenging. Although we’ve seen decades of research around programming and debugging focusing on learners who are in higher education, very little research has been done with school-age students.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1999" height="954" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2.png" alt="The interface of the PRIMMDebug tool" class="wp-image-92076" style="width:758px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2.png 1999w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-300x143.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-500x239.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-768x367.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-1536x733.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-800x382.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-450x215.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image2-900x430.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The interface of the PRIMMDebug tool.</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>In his research, <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/lpg28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laurie Gale</a>, a final-year PhD student at the Research Centre, found that learners were impatient to fix programs by trial and error, without figuring out what the real problemwas with their code or the underlying algorithm. He subsequently developed a tool called <a href="https://primmdebug.web.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PRIMM Debug</a>, which supports a more reflective and systematic approach to debugging. This tool enables learners to slow down when they are programming and to be more reflective. You can read more about it <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/blog-introducing-primmdebug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Research Centre website</a>, and also catch up on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/debugging-positive-experience-secondary-school-students/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Foundation research seminar where he presented his work</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">EPICS: Physical computing in school</h2>



<p>As part of a 5-year longitudinal project, running across the whole UK and the first project of its kind, we are looking at how physical computing impacts primary and secondary school learners. We&#8217;re investigating the effect of physical computing on learners&#8217; creativity, agency and confidence, over time and at particular points known to be important for their subject choices. We are working with a wonderful set of partner primary schools who we visit each year.</p>

</div>


<p>This year we reported some of our first results, which <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3713043.3731552" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">point to teachers’ perceptions of physical computing being engaging and inclusive for primary-aged children</a>. Starting next spring, we will be carrying out our third year of data collection with our pupil cohort, who have reached the age of 10 to 11.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll also be running a survey next summer for upper primary-aged children and their teachers. Please sign up for our <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/stayintouch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teacher Research Network newsletter</a> to be the first to hear about taking part in this survey.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Teacher Inquiry in Computing Education (TICE)</h2>



<p>As part of our TICE project we support teachers to conduct their own action research projects. This is a collaborative project, involving academics across the UK who volunteer to support teachers. The goal is to enable teachers to take a deep dive into a curriculum topic, a pedagogical approach, or a new resource, or to address a wider issue such as gender diversity or accessibility, to inform a change in their practice.</p>



<p>This year 16 teachers published their reports in our <a href="https://computingeducationresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TICE3-Booklet-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teacher Research Booklet</a>, and many also presented their findings online at CAS events or at the KCL-CAS London conference and the CAS National Conference. We’re very proud of them!</p>

<p>With support from the Bidkar Foundation and the Raspberry Pi Foundation, they now help run five Code Clubs, reaching over 200 young people in rural areas of Pune. Along the way, they have twice received the Coolest Projects Judges’ Favourite Award: first online in 2023, and again at Coolest Projects India in September 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How it all began</h2>



<p>For Jayantika and Ruturaj, the spark for coding began at home. During the pandemic, when schools were closed and days felt long, their father encouraged them to try something new. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“When we were at home and there was nothing to do,” recalls Jayantika, “my dad introduced us to coding, and from that time till this date we are participating — and yeah, we love it.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2021, they joined their local Code Club, run by the Bidkar Foundation, which provides coding opportunities for young people in rural areas of Pune. That moment opened a door to creativity neither of them expected. Scratch projects soon filled their weekends with problem-solving, and Ruturaj found himself fascinated by how games worked. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I was too curious how games were made,” he says. “After a while in Code Club, I learned new things and got the answers to my questions.” </p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>As their confidence grew, so did their sense of purpose. They wanted others to experience the same excitement they had discovered. “We thought these things should be shared with others,” says Jayantika. “So that’s why we started a Code Club and began teaching — to spread awareness and knowledge to everyone.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reaching out to rural learners</h2>



<p>Each weekend, Jayantika and Ruturaj set out for nearby villages, with laptops, lesson plans, and a sense of possibility. Their aim is simple but powerful: to bring coding opportunities to children who might otherwise never encounter them. “Village students must also learn coding and get opportunities to come in front,” explains Jayantika.</p>

<p>What started modestly — “one computer and seven students” — has become a thriving network of clubs that now reaches hundreds of young learners. Their father, Mr Bidkar, has been by their side throughout, watching as their initiative has grown from a small idea to something that’s changing lives. “Now we are 25 computers, 200-plus children,” he says proudly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Inside their Code Club sessions</h2>



<p>Their Code Club sessions are lively and filled with curiosity. Children crowd around laptops, excited to build their next animation or game. The mentors blend teaching with fun, alternating between theory and practice to keep things engaging. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“At first, we take theory classes — we explain what’s the game,” says Jayantika. “At the end we let them sit on computers.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some weeks are spent planning and others creating. “We give them a plan, and then next time they create,” she explains. Younger learners, aged six to ten, start with small projects such as animations or motion-based activities. Older learners tackle bigger challenges in Scratch, building their own games from ideas they’ve brainstormed together.</p>

</div>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Sessions end with a much-loved tradition: “After the session ends, we give them 15–20 minutes to do whatever they want,” says Ruturaj. “Because they’re very curious.” The pair work in perfect rhythm. “I manage one group and Ruturaj manages another,” says Jayantika. “If any doubt is there, we solve them together.”</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Mentoring has given both siblings new confidence and skills. “At first we were only on Scratch, and now we’ve expanded our knowledge,” says Jayantika. “Next, we’re going to start robotics. It is simple and it is creative also and it can connect to Scratch.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The role of a mentor</h2>



<p>Over time, Jayantika and Ruturaj have learned that mentoring is as much about listening as it is about instructing. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Sometimes their questions are not so obvious,” laughs Jayantika. “Like ‘Why can’t we change the sprite?’ or ‘Why can’t we use another block?’ We can explain to a certain limit, but after that we are speechless!” </p>
</blockquote>



<p>These moments, she says, are part of the magic of teaching. They push the mentors to explore new ways of explaining and to see coding from a beginner’s perspective again.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Watching their students succeed brings the biggest reward. “We feel very happy that the students are listening to us and they’re doing what we wanted — and they’re even adding extras,” says Jayantika. “Most of them tell us they want to create another project; they want more time.”</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>And for those thinking about becoming mentors, they both agree that empathy is key. “If you want to teach them, you must become a student,” says Ruturaj.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“First, think at the students’ level… explain in simple language and give more time to experiment,” adds Jayantika.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking ahead</h2>



<p>Ruturaj dreams of exploring game development and cybersecurity, while Jayantika hopes to move into web and app design. Together, they balance logic and creativity, each complementing the other’s strengths. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Even though both are coding, we are on different paths,” she smiles.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>For anyone curious about coding, Ruturaj’s advice is simple: “Do it by yourself. Make projects by yourself, share them, and learn from others.” Jayantika adds: “Coding has no limits. You can create anything you imagine — open your mind, open your creativity.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Their father, rightly, is proud not just of their achievements but of how they have inspired others to learn. From a single laptop to five thriving Code Clubs, Jayantika and Ruturaj’s journey shows what’s possible when young people lead with passion and purpose. With support from their family, the Bidkar Foundation, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s India team, they’re proving that talent truly is everywhere — opportunity just needs a spark.</p>



<p>Thank you, Jayantika and Ruturaj, for inspiring young people across India and around the world.</p>

<p>At a time when many young people are using AI for personal and learning purposes, schools are trying to figure out what to teach about AI and how (find out more in this <a href="https://literacytrust.org.uk/research-services/research-reports/young-people-and-teachers-use-of-generative-ai-to-support-literacy-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summer 2025 data about young people’s usage of AI in the UK</a>). One aspect of this is how technical we should get in explaining how AI works, particularly if we want to debunk naive views of the capabilities of the technology, such as that AI tools ‘think’. In this month’s research seminar, we found out how AI contexts can be added to current classroom maths to make maths more interesting and relevant while teaching the core concepts of AI.</p>

<p>At our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research-impact/research/seminars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">computing education research seminar</a> in July, a group of researchers from the <a href="https://www.cammp.online/english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAMMP</a> (Computational and Mathematical Modeling Program) research project shared their work:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Prof. Dr. <a href="https://www.scc.kit.edu/en/staff/martin.frank.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Frank</a>, Founder of CAMMP (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany).</li>

<li>Research Associate <a href="https://www.scc.kit.edu/en/staff/stephan.kindler.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephan Kindler</a> (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany)</li>
</ul>



<p>They talked about how maths already taught in secondary schools can be used to demystify AI. At first glance, this seems difficult to do, as it is often assumed that school-aged learners will not be able to understand how these systems work. This is especially the case for artificial neural networks, which are usually seen as a black box technology — they may be relatively easy to use, but it’s not as easy to understand how they work. Despite this, the Austrian and German team have developed a clear way to explain some of the fundamental elements of AI using school-based maths.</p>



<p>Sarah Schönbrodt started by challenging us to consider that learning maths is an essential part in developing AI skills, as:&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>AI systems using machine learning are data-driven and are based on mathematics, especially statistics and data</li>



<li>Authentic machine learning techniques can be used to bring to life existing classroom maths concepts</li>



<li>Real and relevant problems and associated data are available for teachers to use</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A set of workshops for secondary maths classrooms</strong></h2>



<p>Sarah explained how the CAMMP team have developed a range of teaching and learning materials on AI (and beyond) with an overall goal to “allow students to solve authentic, real and relevant problems using mathematical modeling and computers”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She reflected that much of school maths is set in contexts that are abstract, and may not be very interesting or relevant to students. Therefore, introducing AI-based contexts, which are having a huge impact on society and students’ lives, is both an opportunity to make maths more engaging and also a way to demystify AI.</p>

Those same concepts could be taught using real-world AI contexts. (Slide from the researchers&#8217; presentation.)</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Workshops designed and researched by the team include contexts such as privacy in social networks to learn about decision trees, personalised Netflix recommendations to learn about k-nearest neighbour, word predictions to learn about N-Grams, and predicting life expectancy to learn about regression and neural networks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learning about classification models: traffic lights and the support vector machine</strong></h2>



<p>For the seminar, Sarah walked through the steps to learn about support vector machines. This is an upper secondary workshop for students aged 17 to 18 years old. The context of the lesson is an image problem — specifically, classifying the data representing the colours of a simplified traffic light system (two lights to start with) to work out if a traffic light is red or green.</p>



<p>She walked through each of the steps of the maths workshop:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Plotting data points of two classes, the representation of green and red traffic lights</li>



<li>Finding a line that best separates the data points of both classes</li>



<li>Figuring out what best is</li>



<li>Classifying the data points in relation to the chosen (separating) line</li>



<li>Validating the model statistically to see if it is useful in classifying new data points, including using test data and creating a contingency table (also called a confusion matrix)</li>



<li>Discussing limitations, including social and ethical issues</li>



<li>Explaining how three traffic lights can be expressed as three-dimensional data by using planes</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learning about social and ethical issues</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1232" height="682" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7.png" alt="" class="wp-image-92027" style="width:731px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7.png 1232w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-300x166.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-500x277.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-768x425.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-800x443.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-450x249.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-900x498.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1232px) 100vw, 1232px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Learning about the social and ethical issues in data-driven systems. (Slide from the researchers&#8217; presentation.)</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>As well as learning about lines, planes, distances, dot product and statistical measures, learners are also engaged in discussing the social and ethical issues of the approach taken. They are encouraged to think about bias, data diversity, privacy, and the impact of errors on people. For example, if the model wrongly predicts a light as green when it is red, then an autonomous car would run through a red traffic light. This would likely be a bigger consequence than stopping at a green traffic light that was mis-predicted as red. So should the best line reduce this kind of error?</p>



<p>To teach the workshops, Sarah explained they have developed interactive Jupyter notebooks, where no programming skills are needed. Students fill in the gaps of example code, explore simulations, and write their ideas for discussion for the whole class. No software needs to be installed, feedback is direct, and there are in-depth tasks and staggered hints.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learning about regression models: Weather forecasting and the toy artificial neural network</strong></h2>



<p>Stephan went on to introduce artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are the basis of generative AI applications like chatbots and image generation systems. He focused on regression models, such as those used in weather forecasting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ANNs are very complex. Therefore, to start to understand the fundamentals of this technology, he introduced a ‘toy ANN’ with one input, three nodes, and one output. A function is performed on the input data at each node. With the toy network, the team wants to tackle a major and common misconception: that students think that ANN systems learn, recognise, see, and understand, when really it&#8217;s all just maths.</p>

(Slide from the researchers&#8217; presentation.)</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>The learning activity starts by looking at one node with one input and one output, and can be described as a mathematical function, with a concatenation of two functions (in this case a linear and activation function). Stephan shared an <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/kpjk8qb6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online simulator</a> that visualises how the toy neural network can be explored as students change two parameters (in this case, weight and bias of the functions). Students then look at the overall network, and the way that the output from the three nodes is combined. Again, they can explore this in the simulator. Students compare simple data about weather prediction to the model, and discover they need more functions — more nodes to better fit the data. The activity helps students learn that ANN systems are just highly adjustable mathematical functions that, by adding nodes, can approximate relationships in a given data set. But the approximation only works in the bounds (intervals) in which data points are given, showing that ANNs do not ‘understand’ or ’know’ — it&#8217;s just maths.</p>



<p>Stephen finished by explaining the mutual benefits of AI education and maths education. He suggested maths will enable a deeper understanding of AI, and give students a way to realistically assess the opportunities and risks of AI tools and show them the role that humans have in designing AI systems. He also explained that classroom maths education can benefit from incorporating AI contexts. This approach highlights how maths underpins the design and understanding of everyday systems, supports more effective teaching, and promotes an interdisciplinary way of learning across subjects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some personal reflections — which may not be quite right!</strong></h2>



<p>I have been researching the teaching of AI and machine learning for around five years now, since before ChatGPT and other similar tools burst on the scene. Since then, I have seen an increasing number of resources to teach about the social and ethical issues of the topic, and there are a bewildering number of learning activities and tools for students to train simple models. There are frameworks for the data lifecycle, and an emerging set of activities to follow to prepare data, compare model types, and deploy simple applications. However, I felt the need to understand and to teach about, at a very simple level, the basic building blocks of data-driven technologies. When I heard the CAMMP team present their work at the <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=AIDEA/2025/Symposium#tab-keynote-presentation-45-minutes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIDEA conference in February 2025</a>, I was entirely amazed and I asked them to present here at our research seminar series. This was a piece of the puzzle that I had been searching for — a way to explain the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘bottom of the technical stack of fundamental concepts’</a>. The team is taking very complex ideas and reducing them to such an extent that we can use secondary classroom maths to show that AI is not magic and AI systems do not think. It&#8217;s just maths. The maths is still hard, and teachers will still need the skills to carefully guide students step by step so they can build a useful mental model.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1300" height="731" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event.png" alt="Photo of a class of students at computers, in a computer science classroom." class="wp-image-91975" style="width:794px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event.png 1300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-900x506.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>I think we can simplify these ideas further, and create unplugged activities, simulations, and ways for students to explore these basic building blocks of data representation, as well as classification and representing approximations of complex patterns and prediction. I can sense the beginnings of new ideas in computational thinking, though they’re still taking shape. We’re researching these further and will keep you updated.</p>

<p>We love hearing from members of the community and sharing the stories of amazing young people, volunteers, and educators who are using their passion for technology to create positive change in the world around them.</p>



<p>In our latest story, we’re meeting a group of inspiring young innovators from Belfast — Michelle, 15, Inilouwa, 18, Jedidiah, 14 — and Irioluwa, 11, who are using their creativity and technical skills to tackle an issue that impacts millions of young women across the UK: period poverty.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The power of community</strong></h2>



<p>The group first connected through Diverse Youth, a community space that gave them the chance to collaborate, learn, and grow.</p>



<p>At the youth centre, the girls were introduced to Code Club through mentor, and Jedidiah’s mum, Tiwa. When Tiwa offered them the opportunity to travel to Coolest Projects UK and showcase projects they had been working on, they knew they wanted to make something special…</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tackling taboo topics</strong></h2>



<p>The idea for Flow Body began when Inilouwa was inspired by her sister’s experience at school.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“So, for me, it was my sister actually, that really inspired this project because she would tell me, her school at the time, they run out of period products very frequently, so not a lot of girls could access it.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Wanting to make a difference, the team created Flow Body, a website connecting young women to period charities in the UK and providing reliable information about periods, puberty, and related health issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Playing to their strengths</strong></h2>



<p>The technical side of the project was led by Inilouwa, with the rest of her teammates supporting her with research and content creation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“So, alongside Michelle, I researched the diseases and what can come from period poverty and how different people get by with the lack of period products around,” Jedidiah said.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>


<p>Their research highlighted just how widespread period-related health issues are.</p>



<p>The team discovered that one of the biggest challenges is access to accurate information, given the stigma around discussing menstruation, and using technology to solve this issue seemed like the perfect fit to them.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Inilouwa explained, “Having that access to information that&#8217;s tailored to young women, to young parents, to everyone all across the board would be really helpful, you know, in order to make periods less of a strange topic to discuss.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Celebrating teamwork</strong></h2>



<p>After taking home judges’ favourite in the web category, the girls could not recommend the experience enough. When asked what advice they would give to other young people thinking of taking the leap and entering Coolest Projects, the answer was simple…</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Do it. Don&#8217;t be afraid. Even if tech is not your thing, it&#8217;s not a lot of people&#8217;s things. But like you learn so much, you grow so much and it&#8217;s very fun. It is. It really is,” said Inilouwa.</p>

<p>Listening to the voices of young people is crucial in creating genuinely effective learning resources. That&#8217;s why we recently ran a survey of students who use Ada Computer Science, our platform designed to help students learn and revise key computer science concepts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The different topics are nicely categorised and it is easy to find the information I wish to revise.” – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We were delighted to hear from 103 students, most of whom are 16–19 years old and studying in England, and their insights are invaluable in helping us to continue to develop Ada CS.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Students think Ada CS is high quality and useful</h2>



<p>The most common ways students use Ada CS are for revision and to check whether they understand concepts. The majority of respondents are building Ada CS into their regular study habits, with over half of respondents using the platform every week.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-500x281.png" alt="Photo of a class of students at computers, in a computer science classroom." class="wp-image-91975" style="width:682px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-450x253.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event-900x506.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/11/Ada-CS-event.png 1300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>We were pleased to see the benefits of updates we’ve made, including a redesign of the question finder released in March 2025 — students reported that it is easy to navigate the platform and find what they need: 81% reported being able to find relevant content, and 77% could find the questions they were looking for.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It&#8217;s SO EASY to find exactly what I want.” – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Overall, students perceive Ada CS as both <strong>useful</strong> for learning about computer science concepts and of <strong>high quality</strong>. They reported finding the content clear, with a good level of detail.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The topics are broken down into easily digestible sections, and the provided diagrams really help with understanding the topics.”&nbsp; – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The resource is really well designed, short and concise.”&nbsp; – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also received helpful suggestions for future improvements. Students shared feedback on how the information on the platform is presented, asking for more concise, revision-friendly content as well as guidance for exploring concepts in more depth. We’ll therefore be looking into alternative ways to structure content as we continue to develop Ada CS.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Students rate the quizzes highly</h2>



<p>The most popular feature is the <strong>quizzes and practice questions</strong>,<strong> </strong>including the immediate feedback and hints provided. Students value how these resources help them solidify their knowledge, learn from mistakes, and prepare for assessments.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The questions are clear and make me think, they&#8217;re relevant to my studies and the hints for the questions are very useful.” – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We also appreciated the suggestions we received for how we can further develop this feature, for example, creating more questions, extending the range of question types per topic, and making improvements to the hints.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Impact on learning</h2>



<p>Students also feel that using Ada CS has a tangible impact on their learning. 82% agreed they were more confident that they understand CS concepts as a result of using Ada CS<strong> </strong>and 79% feel more confident learning about computer science concepts without a teacher to explain.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I do CS A level but I hadn&#8217;t done the GCSE and I found that all of the resources gave me enough information to learn the concepts from scratch and now I&#8217;m much more confident in my knowledge of the theory.” – Ada Computer Science student</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s coming next?</h2>



<p>Students provided us with lots of useful feedback and suggestions for how we can further improve Ada CS, especially relating to practice questions. We’re already working on adding more questions across topics, creating more challenging questions, and adding more question types that will enhance students’ learning experience. We’ve got some other exciting developments in the pipeline too, which we’ll announce soon!</p>



<p>Thank you to everyone who took the time to complete the survey. These findings are invaluable for shaping the future of Ada Computer Science, helping us to continue to provide the best possible learning platform for students.</p>
