<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are shaping our world in many ways. Helping young people develop AI literacy — in other words, helping them understand how AI tools work and how to use them responsibly — is essential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we’re committed to empowering educators around the world with everything they need to teach AI confidently and help young people develop AI literacy. That’s why we developed Experience AI: a set of high-quality AI literacy resources designed in collaboration with Google DeepMind that any educator can use, no matter their level of tech knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="850" height="478" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5.png" alt="AI Quests" class="wp-image-91578" style="width:743px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5.png 850w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-300x169.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-500x281.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-768x432.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-800x450.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/AI-Quests-5-450x253.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></figure></div>


<p>We’re excited to introduce a new addition to the Experience AI resources: AI Quests.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enter AI Quests</h2>



<p>Developed by Google Research in collaboration with the Stanford Accelerator for Learning, AI Quests is a browser-based learning experience that lets students step into the role of AI researchers. Through interactive, story-driven activities, they’ll explore essential AI topics such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Data preparation</li>



<li>Testing and evaluation</li>



<li>Bias in AI systems</li>
</ul>



<p>Students will use what they learn about these topics to tackle simulated global challenges. The first quest, Market Marshes, introduces them to how AI technology can be used in flood forecasting, while upcoming quests will explore other real-world issues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why AI Quests matters</h2>



<p>AI technology is frequently used but often poorly understood. AI Quests, like Experience AI more broadly, gives students practical experience of how AI technology works, and shows why it’s so important.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Quest-1-Welcome-to-Market-Marshes-8.png" alt="Market Marshes AI Quest start screen" class="wp-image-91590" style="width:692px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>Here’s what sets AI Quests apart:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Gamified learning: Storytelling and role play turn abstract ideas into immersive experiences<br></li>



<li>Real-world relevance: Students see how AI technology addresses challenges like climate resilience and health equity<br></li>



<li>No prior knowledge required: Any teacher, regardless of subject specialism, can bring AI Quests into their classroom<br></li>



<li>Developed by experts: Built with Google Research and the Stanford Accelerator for Learning, content is high-quality and credible</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s next</h2>



<p>AI Quests is launching in English, with future plans for translations and additional quests to reach even more learners globally.</p>



<p>To support educators, we’re also hosting two free webinars on YouTube and LinkedIn:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>9 October at 4pm BST</li>



<li>16 October at 4pm BST</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tom Mason</strong> is Head of Mathematics and Head of ICT at St Joseph’s College, an all-boys secondary school in South East London. He is passionate about teaching and learning, and has a keen interest in digital education practices.</p>



<p>Mr Mason recently set his Year 10 students a creative coding challenge, which they completed using our <a href="https://editor.raspberrypi.org/en/education" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Editor for Education</a>. The challenge not only boosted student engagement, but also showcased the effectiveness of open-ended, student-led learning in computer science education.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="500" height="553" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-500x553.jpg" alt="Tom Mason" class="wp-image-91557" style="width:520px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-500x553.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-226x250.jpg 226w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-768x849.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-800x885.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-450x498.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason-900x995.jpg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Tom-Mason.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Challenges in the classroom</strong></h2>



<p>Teaching coding in a classroom setting presents a unique set of challenges, with one of the most significant being the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Instead of engaging deeply with concepts like loops, conditions, and sorting algorithms, students now increasingly rely on AI tools to generate entire blocks of code for them, without understanding their functions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, traditional teacher-led instruction methods that focus on isolated coding concepts like inputs and outputs often leave students disconnected from the practical and creative aspects of programming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Against this backdrop, Mr Mason wanted to give his students the opportunity to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Apply their Python knowledge in meaningful ways</li>



<li>Collaborate and problem-solve independently</li>



<li>Explore unfamiliar programming concepts in a guided but open-ended fashion</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The project</strong></h2>



<p>Mr Mason set a simple but powerful brief:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Over three lessons, build a quiz that asks 10 questions about what you’ve learnt on the course.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With this simple instruction, Mr Mason gave students a clear idea about what to do, while giving them the freedom to design their quiz however they liked. Students were also told that:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Their 10 quiz questions had to relate to Python</li>



<li>After creating their quiz, their classmates would give feedback based on key criteria (how well the code worked, the level of creativity, the user experience, etc.)</li>
</ul>



<p>To complete the project, students used<strong> </strong>the Code Editor for Education. Created in collaboration with educators and built purposefully for the classroom, the Code Editor supports a range of teaching styles and learning abilities. Its simple interface encourages students to engage with the logic behind their code — they can’t rely on autocomplete.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="810" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3.png" alt="Code Editor dashboard" class="wp-image-91554" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3.png 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-300x152.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-500x253.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-768x389.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-1536x778.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-800x405.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-450x228.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-3-900x456.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Results</strong></h2>



<p>The open-ended structure led to an explosion of creativity and problem-solving.<strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>Without step-by-step instructions, students had to independently explore solutions to questions like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“How do I randomise questions?”</li>



<li>“How can I hide quiz answers in a separate file?”</li>
</ul>



<p>Some students created multi-file Python projects, separating the logic controlling how the quiz worked from the content, or static information. For example, some students created one file to store the player’s answers and another file to manage the quiz interface and score logic. Students also created other advanced features:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Score tracking based on speed of response</li>



<li>Use of external Python libraries</li>



<li>Custom input and output formatting</li>



<li>Algorithms to randomly order quiz questions </li>
</ul>



<p>All students met the base requirements, but the open-ended nature of the project allowed more advanced students to push the boundaries, without the need for additional scaffolding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Educator reflection</strong></h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“They couldn’t just Google the answer; they had to think critically and test ideas. That’s what made it powerful.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mr Mason noted that the project’s success was due in large part to the flexibility and responsiveness of the Code Editor. Students could iterate quickly, test their ideas, and collaborate, all within a platform built for classroom coding.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It was the most successful thing I’ve done. I’ll definitely be doing it again every year.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key takeaways</strong></h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Project-based learning</strong> fosters deeper engagement and knowledge, and creative application of programming concepts.<br></li>



<li><strong>Open-ended prompts</strong> empower students to explore and develop their own solutions.<br></li>



<li><strong>Code Editor for Education</strong> encourages thoughtful questions and experimentation rather than reliance on autocomplete solutions. With built-in class management and project tools, it offers a safe, browser-based environment ideal for coding in the classroom.</li>
</ul>



<p>Join St Joseph’s College and the 1300+ other schools helping their students build a strong foundation in text-based programming with the Code Editor for Education.</p>

<p>In classrooms across Mexico, a transformation is unfolding. The Experience AI programme isn’t just teaching students about artificial intelligence, it’s empowering teachers and learners to explore, question, and create with it. By equipping educators with accessible tools and sparking curiosity among students, the initiative is shaping a new generation ready to use AI responsibly and creatively.</p>

<p>Educators like Guadalupe Cortes, Lilia Violeta Garvia Sanchez, Ines Martinez, and Ana Judith Zavaleta are at the forefront of this shift. Their experiences reveal just how transformative Experience AI has become.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">From fear to fascination: Demystifying AI</h2>



<p>For many, AI can feel abstract, something from science fiction. Science and math teacher Lilia Violeta Garvia Sanchez remembers that both she and her students once viewed AI as “robots that would take over the world.” Fear gave way to fascination, however, once Experience AI entered the classroom.</p>



<p>Through hands-on lessons, students quickly discovered AI as a practical tool rather than a threat. “I’ve seen a change in the students,” Lilia explains. “They were afraid at first, but now they’re curious and engaged.”</p>



<p>Technology teacher Ines Martinez admits she was also surprised: “I thought the language would be more technical or complex, but it was pleasantly accessible — and very useful.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Equipping educators with tools that work</h2>



<p>A defining strength of Experience AI is its adaptability. Teachers can tailor materials to fit their classrooms while still leaning on the program’s robust foundation.</p>



<p>Guadalupe Cortes points to the built-in glossary as a game-changer: “It was really helpful for me.” She values being able to choose what fits her teaching to keep it relevant: “I selected certain parts to connect with projects I was already running.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sparking critical thinking and ethical awareness</h2>



<p>Experience AI pushes students to think deeply about the ethics and implications of AI.</p>



<p>In Ines’s class, students raised concerns about water use in data centres and debated how to protect their digital identities. They weren’t just learning facts, they were making connections to real-world issues.</p>

<p>Another teacher, Ileana Beurini, described an exercise where students asked different AI models the same political question. When answers varied, they discussed bias and the importance of consulting multiple sources. In another activity, searching images of “worker” led to a conversation about gender equity in technology.</p>



<p>As Ines puts it: “They don’t want it to do all the thinking for them. They said it should be a support — a tool to generate better information, not to replace reasoning or reflection.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Transforming engagement and performance</h2>



<p>The impact on student motivation has been striking. For Ana Judith Zavaleta, the shift was clear: “They’re much more hands-on now — they don’t rely as much on textbooks or theory.” One student who typically struggled academically became one of the most enthusiastic participants, even passing where he previously failed.</p>



<p>Guadalupe Cortes has seen similar enthusiasm: “They’re finding a real purpose in using AI for their own benefit.” At an entrepreneurship fair, her students applied AI concepts to improve their projects, proof that these lessons extend far beyond the classroom.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A call to action for educators</h2>



<p>The teachers’ message is unanimous: embrace AI.</p>



<p>“We should give it a try,” urges Lilia. “Just because we’re teachers doesn’t mean we have to know everything. The world is evolving every single day, and we need to innovate with our students so they feel motivated to keep learning.”</p>

<p>For Ines, the takeaway is simple but powerful: “Take the risk — really, take the chance to learn. Just like the internet became essential, AI will become part of our daily lives and necessary for all areas of teaching — and life itself.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">More than just a set of resources</h2>



<p>Experience AI is more than a set of resources, it’s a movement preparing students to navigate the future with curiosity, critical thinking, and ethical awareness. By igniting minds in Mexico, it’s helping to cultivate responsible digital citizens who will shape not just their classrooms, but the world beyond them.</p>

<p>We love hearing from members of the community and sharing the stories of amazing young people, volunteers, and educators who are using their passion for technology to create positive change in the world around them.</p>



<p>Marie is a force of nature. As the founder of Breadline London, a grassroots community project in Haringey, she has spent years supporting families with essential services — she’s run a food bank, offered budgeting advice, and hosted well-being workshops. But when she heard about Code Club, she saw another way to help local children: by giving them the skills to shape their futures.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="My coding story: Marie | From tech beginner to Code Club mentor" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IZB1pbQJJj8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From community support to coding</strong></h2>



<p>Marie had no background in tech, but that didn’t stop her. She knew that many families in Tottenham couldn’t afford extracurricular activities like coding classes, and she was determined to change that.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I&#8217;ve wanted a coding club for children, children in Tottenham, because that’s not something that is actually here,” she explains. “Unfortunately for us, we are on the very high end of poverty… and some of our children in this area don&#8217;t get the opportunity to attend things like coding club.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With the support of Haringey Giving and the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Marie launched her Code Club at Tottenham Community Sports Centre. She started from scratch, learning alongside the kids, attending free training at the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s headquarters in Cambridge, and soaking up everything she could about coding.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I don’t know anything about coding. Nothing. But going to the training days, it was so inspiring. I got so excited thinking, these are the things I can hopefully share with the children.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Creating a space to experiment</strong></h2>



<p>Marie’s club is more than just learning how to code — it’s about teamwork, creativity, and confidence.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4.jpg" alt="Marie helps a young learner with a coding task in her Code Club." class="wp-image-91489" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-4-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“They need to learn these skills outside of a school environment, outside of a place where it’s really structured. I want them to come in, experiment, make things up as they go along. Sometimes they follow instructions, but mostly, they just try things out.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She also sees her role as a mentor, even if the kids sometimes know more than she does!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Most of the children know more about coding than I do. So for me, it’s just about encouraging them: ‘What’s next? What else can you add to your project?’ And helping parents understand that they need to let the children create what they want to create, not just steer them.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Discovering Coolest Projects</strong></h2>



<p>Marie’s journey didn’t stop with Code Club. When she learnt about Coolest Projects, a global showcase where kids celebrate what they’ve built with code, she knew she had to take her club to one of the in-person events.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2.jpg" alt="Marie helps a young learner with a coding task in her Code Club." class="wp-image-91492" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Marie-2-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I was in Cambridge when I first heard about it, and this fabulous young woman spoke about Coolest Projects. I just felt so excited to take the children somewhere that’s just kids, just kids learning about coding and developing these amazing things. I even said, ‘Even if no one from my club comes, I’m going by myself!’”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Taking the kids to Coolest Projects was a game-changer. They saw what was possible, talked to other young coders, and left inspired.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Next year, when we go again, everybody’s going to have a project. Seeing the kids’ faces when adults wanted to try their projects, it was so exciting for them!”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Making a change</strong></h2>



<p>Marie is proof that you don’t need to be a tech expert to start a Code Club — you just need passion and a willingness to learn.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2.jpg" alt="Two educators are chatting at a workshop." class="wp-image-91493" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Future-engineer_Dojo_44-2-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>Marie’s message to others who are thinking about setting up a coding club but worry about their lack of experience is simple:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Start a [Code Club] because the children will help you to run [it]. They will help you. They will help each other. Don’t get put off running a coding club because you don’t know how to code. Because I don’t[…]and I love it.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Marie’s story is a testament to what’s possible when someone believes in their community and takes action. She is creating opportunities for young people in Tottenham, giving them a space to learn, collaborate, and dream big regardless of their background. We can’t wait to see what her club achieves next!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the UK Bebras Challenge?</strong></h2>



<p>The UK Bebras Challenge is a free-to-enter annual challenge that is designed to spark interest in both computational thinking and computer science among students aged 6 to 19. The 45-minute challenge is accessible to everyone, offering age-appropriate but challenging interactive tasks for students at different levels, including a tailored version for students with severe sight impairments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tasks are designed to give every student the opportunity to showcase their potential and all participating students receive a certificate. There are also certificates based on performance within school and gold certificates based on national boundaries. With self-marking tasks and no text-based programming required, it’s easy to have your school participate in the UK Bebras Challenge.</p>



<p>This year, each task’s background section is linked to the <a href="https://adacomputerscience.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ada Computer Science platform</a>. Teachers and students can now explore detailed explanations of the computing concepts behind the Bebras tasks, along with the computational thinking skills students may use to solve them.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Bebras provides us with incredibly useful insights and conversations about our students who might otherwise have struggled with accessing traditional CS materials. It&#8217;s also a great resource for baseline tests where students may not have studied the curriculum the way we present it.” – Teacher in the UK</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I think the problems are a really great way to promote critical thinking, computational thinking, and logic in general. I have only seen a couple but I am very impressed and excited to share with some of my students. Thanks for what you are doing.” – Teacher in the UK</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What does a UK Bebras task look like?</strong></h2>



<p>The tasks are inspired by classic computing problems and presented in a fun, age-appropriate way. For example, younger students aged 6 to 8 might solve the mystery of a dancing doll, while older students aged 16 to 19 could take on the challenge of an art theft. Both of these tasks involve the use of data structures.</p>



<p>Here’s a question we ran in 2021 for the Juniors group (ages 10 to 12). Can you solve it?&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Beaver farmer</strong></h3>



<p>Farmer Mert grows wheat in the fields, which contain a <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="32" height="32" src="blob:https://www.raspberrypi.org/a672b7b8-0072-4091-aa50-96cd81470773"> symbol in the map below.</p>



<p>He also has stony fields where nothing grows, shown by the <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="33" height="33" src="blob:https://www.raspberrypi.org/9467b388-49d6-4172-b7b8-9a2340b1e990">&nbsp;symbol.</p>



<p>To save water, Mert only wants to water the wheat fields. He can block the water channels coming from the lake at the spots marked with the letters A to J.</p>



<p>The water will only flow downwards towards the fields and will never flow back towards the lake.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Task</strong></h3>



<p>Select the letters to block the water from flowing to the empty fields while still letting it flow to the wheat fields.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="332" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image3-500x332.png" alt="Example image from a task 'Beaver Farmer' featured in the UK Bebras Challenge." class="wp-image-91466" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image3-500x332.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image3-300x199.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image3-768x510.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image3-800x531.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image3-450x299.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image3-900x598.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image3.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Example answer</strong></h3>



<p>The correct answer is that spots labelled B, F, H, and J must be closed, as shown in the following figure:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="332" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image2-500x332.png" alt="Example answer image from a task 'Beaver Farmer' featured in the UK Bebras Challenge." class="wp-image-91467" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image2-500x332.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image2-300x199.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image2-768x510.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image2-800x531.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image2-450x299.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image2-900x598.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image2.png 1530w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Explanation</strong></h3>



<p>If none of the gates are closed, the water will reach the stony fields. If more gates than shown above are closed, then some wheat fields will get no water. If we review all spots:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A must be open to allow water to flow to field 1.</li>



<li>B has to be <strong>closed</strong> to avoid watering field 2. It also brings water to field 3, but this field can also get it through C.</li>



<li>C must be open both for field 4 and for field 3, which cannot be watered though A since B is closed.</li>



<li>D must be open for fields 7 and 8.</li>



<li>E must also be open field 7.</li>



<li>F must be <strong>closed</strong> to prevent water flowing to field 5.</li>



<li>G, if closed, would only prevent field 3 from being watered and so must be open as well.</li>



<li>H must also be <strong>closed</strong> even if F is also closed, as water can flow from the open D and E.</li>



<li>I must be open for field 11.</li>



<li>J has to be<strong> closed</strong> to prevent fields 9 and 10 from getting watered.</li>
</ul>



<p>This Bebras task was developed by the Bebras team in Turkey and refined by members of the international Bebras community.</p>



<p>Did you get it right?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Working together to design AI</h2>



<p>Our June research seminar was delivered by Netta Iivari, Professor in Information Systems at the University of Oulu’s INTERACT Research Unit.</p>



<p>The INTERACT research group focuses on understanding and supporting participatory design, user-centered design, user-driven innovation, and human interaction with technology in everyday life contexts. From this perspective, “users” aren’t considered as passive consumers, but as valuable co-creators and content producers. This calls for different approaches that place emphasis on empowerment and inclusion in designing, shaping, and co-creating information technology in everyday life.</p>



<p>As part of this work, Netta introduced the idea of ‘transformative agency’ — empowering children to believe they can solve problems they care about — and its application in secondary computing education. She showed examples of how to foster young people’s transformative agency within computing, specifically focusing on transdisciplinary approaches to learning about AI and inviting young people to critically analyse and design their futures with AI tools in it.</p>



<p>Netta began by giving an overview of two of the <a href="https://interact.oulu.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">INTERACT Research Unit</a>’s projects:&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The <a href="https://interact.oulu.fi/mad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Make a difference</strong></a> (MAD) project (2019–2023) explored critical design with young people, focusing on their emerging designer and maker identities in the context of tackling a significant societal problem — in this case, bullying.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Children&#8217;s transformative agency and emerging technologies for social good</strong> (TAKEOVER) (2024–2028), a current project, explores the potential of emerging technologies (artificial intelligence, virtual reality (VR), social robots, etc.) to address societal problems, such as climate change, gender equality, bullying, and discrimination. It focuses on children&#8217;s emerging transformative agency and activist identities when engaging with these tools and topics.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1683" height="1152" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404.jpg" alt="An educator points to an image on a secondary learners computer screen." class="wp-image-83703" style="width:721px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404.jpg 1683w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-300x205.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-500x342.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-768x526.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-1536x1051.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-800x548.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-450x308.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/04/Experience-AI-classroom-scaled-e1681724472404-900x616.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1683px) 100vw, 1683px" /></figure></div>


<p>Netta explained that these projects give young people an opportunity to begin to address the problems they care about, even though they may be very complex problems. From this problem-solving perspective, children are introduced (or ‘sensitised’) to emerging technologies as tools for social good.</p>



<p>She then went on to outline the key pedagogical approaches that underpin these projects:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Critical, ethical, empowering design</strong><br>This pedagogy draws on critical and speculative design traditions in design research and encourages young people to take a critical perspective towards society, its norms, and the status quo, as part of design thinking. Children consider the ethical values and consequences of their designs. They begin to experience the ways in which engaging in the design process can be empowering and transformative for them, collectively as well as individually.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Transformative agency of children</strong><br>This approach encourages young people to consider their capacity to have agency in the world, by enabling them to envision change and commit to taking action to solve problems that they care about.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Fostering transformative agency of children in the age of AI</strong><br>Transformative agency is achieved when young people engage in ‘expansive learning’ — when they learn something novel, together, and are encouraged to look beyond the confines of school work, the topic, themselves, and the tools available for solving the problem. This approach fosters an active, critical, reflective mindset that encourages children to believe that they can make change and have impact in the world.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The project design process</h2>



<p>The projects follow 3 design phases and include a range of plugged and unplugged activities, as shown in Figure 1.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1268" height="696" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-1.png" alt="Figure 1. The project phases" class="wp-image-91438" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-1.png 1268w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-1-300x165.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-1-500x274.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-1-768x422.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-1-800x439.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-1-450x247.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-1-900x494.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1268px) 100vw, 1268px" /></figure></div>


<p>Netta then described in more detail some of the activities that have been used to address these different project phases and the design process involved. For example, to explore what are the problems that children really care about, they are asked to imagine ‘carrying a stone in your pocket for one week, as if it was a magic tool. Where could it be used in your everyday life? What problems could it solve? What problems would you like it to solve and how?’&nbsp;</p>



<p>Young people are then introduced to a range of novel technologies, for example, VR headsets, robots, and emulators of AI-driven social media platforms, such as &#8220;Somekone&#8221;, developed as part of the <a href="https://www.generation-ai-stn.fi/">Generative AI project</a> at the University of Eastern Finland. They deconstruct and reconstruct generative AI tools by prompting large language model (LLM) chatbots such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc. and exploring bias in their outputs. They perform small-scale algorithmic auditing. They also create mini language models, so-called &#8216;baby LLMs&#8217;, with Google Colab using the text in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> to train their models, and then open datasets (books as text files from Project Gutenberg). In exploring the responses these models generate, young people experience the potential and the limitations of such tools and gain an important understanding of the human activity involved in the development of AI technologies.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--scaled.jpg" alt="Secondary school age learners in a computing classroom." class="wp-image-85670" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/Spencer-5--900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure></div>


<p>Once they have had this ‘sensitising‘ exposure to a range of tools, they then work in groups on a project that makes use of AI to solve the societal problem they have chosen. These problems could encompass a range of topics, such as racism, animal rights, the impact of AI, war, mental health, bullying. The young people are prompted to think about how large language models can be used to solve the problem, or parts of the problem. But importantly, they are also asked to consider the different motives and perspectives of the multiple stakeholders involved in the problem and its solution and whether their model ideas will create new problems when deployed.</p>



<p>They follow the 3 project phases shown in Figure 1 to design and make a range of digital (robots, apps, videos) and non-digital artefacts to solve their problem. Netta emphasised that although it could take 10 weeks or more to implement all the suggested activities, it is also possible to pick and choose individual tasks from the 3 phases to suit available curriculum timescales.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Envisioning and critiquing AI futures</h2>



<p>Other project tasks involve:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Envisioning AI futures by imagining that a miracle has happened overnight and the problem has disappeared — what is the result?&nbsp;</li>



<li>Critiquing AI futures by creating best and worst case scenarios of the consequences of the AI systems they design, creating video adverts promoting their AI solutions and anti-adverts, focusing on the possible negative consequences of their prototypes&nbsp;</li>



<li>Fostering action-taking by presenting theatrical performances to showcase how their designs tackle a problem and illustrating the AI-related issues surrounding the topic or by creating activism campaign material to mobilise the school community on the same themes&nbsp;</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1772" height="1183" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0001.jpg" alt="Secondary education learners in the classroom" class="wp-image-91442" style="width:808px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0001.jpg 1772w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0001-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0001-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0001-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0001-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0001-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0001-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/CODE_CLUB_CHENNAI_0001-900x601.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1772px) 100vw, 1772px" /></figure></div>


<p>These projects situate learning about data-driven technologies in real-world contexts and promote a transdisciplinary approach, teaching and learning about AI from a problem-solving perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This perspective conveys important messages to young people — that they do have agency and can take action in the face of many of the world&#8217;s problems, that they can and should be active, critical users of the new technologies that surround them, and that these technologies can be used to change the world for good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Netta ended the seminar by asking viewers to consider how they could foster transformative agency in the young people they teach and whether or not they consider it to be important in computing education.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Meet the new Astro Pi Ambassador</strong></h2>



<p>We are thrilled to introduce you to the Astro Pi ambassador for 2025–26, ESA Astronaut Sophie Adenot. Sophie is from France and has had an incredible journey to becoming an astronaut. She holds a Masters in Engineering, has been a helicopter test pilot, and was awarded the French National Order of Merit (Chevalier) for her public services in gender equality in the sciences. Sophie is one of the new “Hoppers” cohort of ESA astronauts who graduated in 2023. She will be going on her first mission to the ISS in Spring 2026.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choose your space mission</strong></h2>



<p>Not sure where to start? The European Astro Pi challenge, or Astro Pi for short, has two missions that young people can participate in depending on their coding abilities. Both Missions use Python programming to create short computer programs that will be run on the ISS. Which one will you choose?&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mission Zero: Your pixel art in space</strong></h2>



<p>Mission Zero offers a chance for young people to create a nature-inspired piece of pixel art using Python and have it displayed for astronauts to see on special Raspberry Pi computers, called Astro Pis, aboard the ISS. We wanted to share some of our favourite pixel art creations from last year&#8217;s mission — you can find them as new examples in our project guide. If your team needs some inspiration to get started, they can choose to recreate or remix one of these examples, or create their own.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mission Space Lab: Become a space scientist</strong></h2>



<p>For our more experienced coders, Mission Space Lab returns with a real-world scientific task: calculate the speed of the International Space Station as accurately as possible. Teams of between two and six&nbsp; young people will write a Python program that collects data from the Astro Pi computers on the ISS to perform this calculation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year, we’ve made some user improvements to the Astro Pi Replay tool, which allows teams to test their programs with a real-time simulation using historical ISS data and images. This updated online tool makes it even easier to see how your program would perform in orbit and troubleshoot any errors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The submission deadline for Mission Space Lab is <strong>16 February 2026</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Adapting for unique needs</h2>



<p>Every country and region has unique opportunities, challenges, and needs. In a vast country like India, every state is different — <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/adapting-our-computing-curriculum-resources-for-odisha-the-journey-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what works in Odisha</a> may not work in other locations. Thus, to meet the needs of students in the state of Telangana, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/computing-curriculum-framework-adapting-to-indias-diverse-landscapes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ve been working on adapting The Computing Curriculum</a> specifically for them.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/10/YP7_1940-scaled.jpg" alt="A group of female students at the Coding Academy in Telangana." class="wp-image-85251" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/10/YP7_1940-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/10/YP7_1940-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/10/YP7_1940-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/10/YP7_1940-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/10/YP7_1940-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/10/YP7_1940-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/10/YP7_1940-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/10/YP7_1940-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/10/YP7_1940-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure></div>


<p>Our work in Telangana began in 2023, when we kickstarted <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/tswreis-coding-academy-computing-education-partnership-telangana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a five-year partnership with the Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TGSWREIS)</a>, a society under the Government of Telangana. Through the partnership, we’ve developed an adapted curriculum, along with training for educators working in educational institutions with limited resources. The adapted curriculum includes localised examples and activities, and teaching approaches to make the learning experience feel relevant and meaningful for students in Telangana, while keeping the core learning outcomes aligned with global standards.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Testing and iterating</h3>



<p>Since the start of the partnership, we’ve been testing the curriculum at the Coding Academy School, a co-educational school at Moinabad, and the Coding Academy College, a degree college for women in Shamirpet.</p>



<p>Our work delivering the curriculum in Telangana was our first time using a direct-to-learners model. The Coding Academy School and College gave us unique opportunities to work with students directly and observe first-hand the difference the programme made in their learning journeys.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/YP7_1945-scaled.jpg" alt="A group of students and a teacher at the Coding Academy in Telangana." class="wp-image-85669" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/YP7_1945-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/YP7_1945-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/YP7_1945-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/YP7_1945-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/YP7_1945-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/YP7_1945-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/YP7_1945-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/YP7_1945-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/11/YP7_1945-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure></div>


<p>During the first year of implementation, we gathered useful feedback from students and teachers. Check out one of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/implementing-a-computing-curriculum-in-telangana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our earlier blogs where we share some of the findings</a>. We used these inputs to further develop the curriculum.</p>



<p>This updated version of the curriculum was implemented in the 2024/25 academic year. At the school, our educators worked with 210 students in grades 7–9, while at the college, our educators worked with 382 undergraduate students. As in the first year, we used data from assessments, lesson observations, educator interviews, student surveys, and student focus groups to understand what’s working well and what could be improved. So what did we learn?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we learnt over the past year</h2>



<p>Our evaluation findings show that the updated curriculum worked well and positive outcomes are being achieved for most students. Educators felt prepared to teach the curriculum in this second year and found the ongoing support and spaces for discussion really useful. Moreover, we found that there are potential positive ripple effects beyond the school as well.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Learning outcomes are being achieved to a high degree</h3>



<p>In surveys, 91% of students in the school and 96% of students in the college responded that the lessons helped them get better at computing and coding. Students feel they are not just learning new skills but also finding the content enjoyable: 88% of students in the school and 98% of students in the college responded that they are enjoying their classes. Educators and observers also reported that students were engaged during lessons, and often completed activities without needing any support.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="819" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image.png" alt="Students' reflections on the computing curriculum." class="wp-image-91393" style="width:720px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image.png 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-300x154.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-500x256.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-768x393.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-1536x786.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-800x410.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-450x230.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/image-900x461.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div>


<p>Students’ assessment scores further confirmed positive learning outcomes. 4 out of every 5 scores in the school and 9 out of every 10 scores in the college were 60% or above, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/empowering-indias-digital-future-our-computing-curriculums-impact/." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was higher than in the first year of the adapted curriculum’s implementation.</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The updated curriculum is more aligned to student needs</h3>



<p>The changes we made to the curriculum included:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Adding more localised examples</li>



<li>Simplifying the language&nbsp;</li>



<li>Restructuring the flow of the content</li>
</ul>



<p>Educators were highly positive about the updates to the curriculum.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The students are able to [better] understand the examples because we updated [to] the India context examples.” — Educator, Coding Academy School&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Students are receiving it very well because we have modified the content this year, and [that includes] the placements of the unit and the connectivity of the lessons and units.” — Educator, Coding Academy School</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Additionally, for the college curriculum, we aligned the content more closely with the learning objectives set by Osmania University — with which the college is affiliated. We also included more advanced topics for students specialising in data science. During interviews, educators reported that the content was now much better aligned to student expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“[The curriculum] we have designed is based as per [the] Osmania University curriculum. [The lessons] are definitely meeting the students&#8217; needs because whatever discussions we are taking in classes, they are [successfully] participating in those discussions and they are doing whatever activities we give them.” — Educator, Coding Academy College</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Outside of knowledge and skills in computing, the curriculum is also helping students develop wider life skills. In our survey, college students shared that working on projects gives them a sense of accomplishment and the confidence to solve real-world problems. Many students also reported that through the curriculum they are developing higher-order thinking skills, which will support their future careers.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The thrill lies the creativity and problem-solving aspects. I get to turn ideas into reality pieces, and there is something incredible satisfying about debugging code and watching it run flawlessly. It&#8217;s like slow, challenging puzzles, frustrating at times but rewarding when everything clicks.” — Student, Coding Academy College</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“My favourite thing [about] the computing and coding classes [is the] Scratch programme. I have learnt it [for the] first time. By learning I have enjoyed a lot. During the coding process, it trains our brain to think deeply, identify trouble, and break things up and put pieces together [as] a solution.” — Student, Coding Academy College</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Students are inspired to continue engaging&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Students are showing high interest in applying their skills outside of their classes. Almost all students — 100% in the school and 99% in the college — reported that they would like to participate in coding-related competitions.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0255.jpg" alt="A group of female students working on a coding project." class="wp-image-91401" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0255.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0255-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0255-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0255-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0255-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0255-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0255-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>Educators also told us that many students are exploring future job opportunities in the computing and digital technology fields, and are curious about topics outside the curriculum. Interestingly, 93% of the college students who were studying courses not traditionally associated with jobs in computing and digital technology reported that they would like to pursue a job in computing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The positive benefits go beyond the school</h3>



<p>We have also learnt that a high-quality computing education for young people has potentially wider benefits for the community. One educator described how students are helping their families, many of whom have limited experiences, engage more confidently with digital technologies.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Families don&#8217;t know how to use smartphones and laptop computers, but our students know very well so I can say they do teach to their elders how to use these platforms.” — Educator, Coding Academy School</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Ongoing support for educators was important</h3>



<p>To help educators feel confident and prepared, individualised learning resources were provided throughout the year. These were well received by educators. Educators also found the weekly meetings with our India-based team members useful to discuss ongoing challenges regarding delivery and assessments.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What could still be improved</h3>



<p>There were improvements this year in the availability of equipment, and the use of Wi-Fi dongles addressed internet connectivity issues to some degree. However, educators still faced some challenges. For example, educators in the school faced issues accessing printed worksheets and educators in the college faced issues accessing projectors during their lessons. We are working closely with our delivery partner to address these issues for the new academic year.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1536" height="1024" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1.jpg" alt="A group of male students working on a coding project." class="wp-image-91402" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/09/YP7_1955-1536x1024-1-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /></figure></div>


<p>With regard to the content, educators felt the curriculum could benefit from some further amendments. For the school curriculum, these include easing the transition from block-based to text-based coding. For the college curriculum, there were suggestions for more focus on real-world applications of coding and including advanced topics, like machine learning, for undergraduates specialising in computing-related subjects. We have considered all these suggestions and made necessary revisions to the curriculum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next steps in Telangana: Scaling up impact</h2>



<p>With the success of the pilot, we’re excited to announce that the adapted curriculum will now be implemented at over 350 schools and junior colleges in the state of Telangana. A majority of schools will be with the same partner, TGSWREIS, while some schools and junior colleges will be with other partners. The Coding Academy School will become our hub for trialling new curriculum content and strategies, and conducting research studies and teacher training and support. Additionally, the school will also host inter-school events.</p>

<p>The progress we&#8217;ve seen so far in Telangana is very encouraging. We look forward to continuing these partnerships and helping more young people realise their potential through the power of computing and digital technologies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we learnt about adapting curriculum resources for different regions</h2>



<p>From our work in Telangana, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/adapting-our-computing-curriculum-resources-for-odisha-the-journey-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Odisha</a>, and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/adapting-our-computing-curriculum-resources-for-kenya-the-journey-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenya</a>, we’ve learnt that a curriculum isn’t a one-size-fits-all product. The local context, culture, and educational provisions are important considerations when adapting learning resources for different regions. We’ve also learnt that building long-term partnerships with organisations who have local expertise is key to understanding these considerations and effectively reaching communities where we can make the biggest difference. Finally, we’ve learnt that adaptation isn’t a one-time activity. It’s a cycle of continuous refinement; listening closely to feedback from the ground is important to ensure that our support for educators and learning experiences for young people have the best possible impact.</p>

<p>Getting creative with technology is now easier than ever on the <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Club Projects</a> website. If you’ve visited Code Club Projects recently, you may have noticed that the site has changed over the last few months. In the spring, we launched an initiative to make it easier to <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find a project</a>. I’m excited to share some of the changes we’ve made based on feedback from young people and mentors.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding projects based on difficulty</h2>



<p>Being able to filter projects by skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) has been the feature most requested by mentors. A survey we ran in the spring confirmed that young people find levels helpful when trying to find a project on their own. While our project paths have always had levels, our expert educators have now reviewed every single project on the site and categorised them as a Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 project. These difficulty levels are easily available as filters on the side of the search page.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“[The Code Club] resources are extremely helpful, particularly for mentors with limited experience; step-by-step guidance is very useful and effective.” – Code Club mentor, Tunisia</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding projects based on interest</h2>



<p>For young people and mentors who aren’t sure where to get started with coding, an easy question to ask is “What do you like to do”? With over 200+ projects on the site, there is a wide variety of projects that span a number of young people’s passions, such as games, art, or nature. In fact, in the same spring survey, young people largely preferred finding projects by interest over technology (e.g., Scratch, Python).&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why we’ve created a brand-new set of pages dedicated to helping young people find projects by interest. We believe making it easy to find a project by an existing interest will help young people get excited about coding.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“[Attending Code Club] … combined with watching peers make cool things seems to be a great encouragement to go build rather than just consume.” – Code club mentor, Japan</p>

<p>Code Clubs projects are designed to appeal to creators’ interests, including creating their own games.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding projects based on technology</h2>



<p>Through the Clubs annual survey, we know that some young people enjoy following our project pathways and others enjoy finding an individual project to work on during club time. We also know that some of our top search terms are “Scratch” and “Python”, which allow users to see all Scratch projects that are available on the site. We’ve redesigned our technology pages so it’s easy to see paths and projects per technology in the same place.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s next?</h2>



<p>We’ve heard from mentors that our projects are too long to print out. We’re working to improve that, starting with brand-new short PDFs for the Intro to Scratch path projects. Each PDF is no more than six pages, double-sided.</p>



<p>Are there other projects you’d like to see PDF versions of? <a href="https://form.raspberrypi.org/4874134">Let us know.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re currently working on an idea tentatively titled “project challenges”. If you’re interested in helping us develop the idea, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://form.raspberrypi.org/4874134&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1756380196157806&amp;usg=AOvVaw1yzxl1eNoY29z2_1-pZW8R">please get in touch</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>If you have not started a club yet but are interested in supporting the young people in your community to explore coding, you can find out more on the <a href="https://codeclub.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Club</a> website.

<p>Taking part in the European Astro Pi Challenge builds young people’s confidence and motivates them to try further digital making and programming activities, according to their mentors. The challenge, a European Space Agency (ESA) Education project run in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, offers young people the amazing opportunity to write a short computer program to run on Raspberry Pi computers on board the International Space Station (ISS).</p>



<p>An incredible 27,304 young people from 27 countries got involved in Astro Pi 2024–25, with 26,294 succeeding in having their code run in space across the two challenge activities, Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab. As in past years, we’ve asked mentors and their teams about their experience and the impact participating had on them. So what did they say?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How we listened to feedback</h2>



<p>To find out what worked well, what we could improve, and the impact Astro Pi has had on young people&#8217;s lives this year, we encouraged mentors to complete a survey after teams submitted their computer programs. We also ran focus group discussions to deepen our understanding. A huge thank you to the 99 Mission Zero and 26 Mission Space Lab mentors who completed our surveys, and the five mentors who participated in our focus groups.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is working well</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Low stakes but high impact</h3>



<p>Mentors believe that Astro Pi is a great opportunity for young people to build their coding skills and knowledge of STEM concepts. Close to 80% of mentors for Mission Zero and 90% for Mission Space Lab agreed that these outcomes were being achieved for the young people in their teams. Mentors also appreciated that while the programme had real-world application, the learning experience was relaxed and low pressure.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="603" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-91324" style="width:720px" title="Chart" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4.png 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-300x113.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-500x188.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-768x289.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-1536x579.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-800x302.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-450x170.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-900x339.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div>


<p>Many of our young participants come from areas of educational disadvantage or traditionally underrepresented groups where confidence with technology and STEM subjects can be low. Mentors reported that the programme empowers young people, increasing their confidence with computing and digital making, and helping them connect with a wider community of learners from around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“They [young people] come from complicated environments and sometimes their confidence is very low. They don&#8217;t believe in themselves and this [Mission Zero challenge] really empowers them.” — Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;I think having a space mission, having Mission Zero is a way of connecting not only to a worldwide group of learners, but also explorers, future scientists, future astronauts. To see them as part of a larger community, not just an activity or assignment that they have to do in class. They discover their own abilities and potential, and exercise their creativity in a very low stakes environment… and then to see it come to life in that global way I think is extremely valuable.” — Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This increased confidence also encourages young people to take on other opportunities. 78% of Mission Zero mentors and 96% of Mission Space Lab mentors believe that it is likely that their students will participate in other coding and digital making challenges in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Space is cool!</h3>



<p>The connection to space and the ISS continues to be a strong motivator, not just for young people but also mentors and other peers. In our survey, 90% of mentors in Mission Zero and 92% in Mission Space Lab reported that the young people participating were highly motivated by the possibility of having their code run on the ISS. In focus groups, mentors highlighted how the excitement of working on a space project extended to them and other adults too.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“They&#8217;ve always really enjoyed the sheer fact that you get to send stuff into space because it is really cool.” — Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“You know, even the adults I tell about this say, ‘oh, that sounds amazing. Can I do it?’ I go, ‘No, you&#8217;re too old. I&#8217;m too old.’” — Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;We want our code to run in space! We are fascinated by discovery and the opportunity to contribute to a real science experiment on the ISS.&#8221; — Mission Space Lab mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The resources and guidance are useful</h3>



<p>We know how crucial mentors are to the success of Astro Pi. Mentors come from diverse backgrounds and we are committed to making sure they feel prepared and supported. We were thrilled to hear that over 90% of Mission Zero mentors and 80% of Mission Space Lab mentors found the Astro Pi resources useful.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I had no skills but the support proved to be excellent” — Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Step-by-step instructions were excellent and really clear. Very easy to follow.” — Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For Mission Space Lab, the more technical activity, we’ve been working on providing additional support. In 2024–25 we introduced a new online simulator tool for teams to test their programs with historical ISS data. Mentors found the tool to be helpful, allowing them to troubleshoot their code.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What could be improved?</h2>



<p>While we celebrate the successes, we’re always keen to understand how we can improve the programme.</p>



<p>As in previous years, mentors reported that young people whose computer programs passed the eligibility criteria and ran on the ISS (or “achieved flight status&#8221;, as we call it) benefited most from the experience. While 12% more Mission Space Lab teams achieved flight status this year compared to last year, some registered teams still did not submit programs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To understand why, we surveyed mentors who had registered but who did not then submit computer programs. In the 55 responses, the main reasons given were a shortage of time due to other school commitments, and their teams finding the challenge difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some survey respondents suggested a need for more simplified, step-by-step instructions for less experienced learners. Additionally, a few teams faced technical issues with the online portal and the testing tool.</p>



<p>Thank you to all the mentors who provided their honest feedback. We’ve read and considered all of it and will use it to make Astro Pi even better in the future.</p>



<p>Astro Pi will be launching for its 10th year on Monday, 8 September 2025. We’ve been working on making it easier than ever to take part in both missions and are looking forward to supporting you and your teams in getting your code into space. If you’re interested in taking part, <a href="https://astro-pi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up to our newsletter</a> and get the latest news and information about our resources for this year’s missions. </p>
