<p>This week, young people participating in the European Astro Pi Challenge 2024/25 will have their programs run in space! Astronauts from the European Space Agency (ESA) have been setting up the Astro Pi computers on board the International Space Station (ISS) ready to receive the programs. </p>



<p>The European Astro Pi Challenge is an ESA Education project run in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It has two strands: Mission Zero, where young people write programs that display pixel art on LED screens on board the ISS, and Mission Space Lab, where more advanced learners attempt to calculate the speed of the ISS by writing programs that gather data from onboard equipment.</p>



<p>This year has already been a great year for the challenge!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mission Zero reaches more young people than ever</h2>



<p>Mission Zero received 17,285 team submissions this year, representing 25,405 young people from ESA member and associate member states. This marks the highest-ever level of participation in Mission Zero since its inception back in 2017. Here at Mission Control, we’re delighted to announce that nearly all the participating teams (17,109 out of 17,285) have achieved ‘flight status’ — meaning that their programs will run in space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been great to see so many young people taking part from areas of educational disadvantage too. Through partnerships with youth organisations and community events such as Beyond the Bias and Norwich Science Festival, we’ve seen Mission Zero reach even more young creators from traditionally underrepresented groups.</p>



<p>The 2024/25 Mission Zero project guide featured new coded pixel art examples for teams to remix and reinterpret. Many teams also created their own artworks and animations, with amazing creativity and coding skills on display. We’ll be selecting six submissions from this year to feature as the new code examples in the 2025/26 Mission Zero project guide. Look out for more news on this in the summer.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="864" height="864" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image.gif" alt="A selection of pixel art inspired by nature created by young people for Mission Zero" class="wp-image-89948" style="width:606px;height:auto"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">GIFs submitted by Mission Zero participants</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">New highs for Mission Space Lab</h2>



<p>Mission Space Lab teams were tasked again this year with writing programs to collect data from cameras and sensors on board the ISS to calculate its speed. We’ve been really pleased to see 562 teams register and 325 submit their programs. This has resulted in an amazing 309 teams being awarded flight status — their programs will each run on the ISS for ten minutes, giving participants the unparalleled opportunity to record sensor data in space and take photos many miles above the Earth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More teams have submitted programs and achieved flight status this year than in 2023/24. We believe this uptick is due, in part, to a couple of new additions that have made submissions easier:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Firstly, Mission Space Lab teams can now test their programs online using the <a href="https://missions.astro-pi.org/msl/replay-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Pi Replay Tool</a>. This gives them a chance to see if their program will work on the real Astro Pis on board the ISS by replaying historical data sets captured from previous missions. </li>
</ul>



<p>Secondly, teams have been able to use the Picamzero Python library, which makes it easier to use PiCamera2 functionality.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Deployment</h2>



<p>Today’s the day when Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab teams with flight status will have their programs sent up to the ISS. Astronauts have been busy setting up the Astro Pi computers ready to receive the programs and putting them into position. Over the next two weeks, the programs will run and the collected data will be sent down from the ISS to Earth.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="1200" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5.png" alt="An illustration of the International Space Station sending program files to a satellite dish on Earth" class="wp-image-89950" style="width:746px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5.png 1200w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-250x250.png 250w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-500x500.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-150x150.png 150w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-768x768.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-800x800.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-100x100.png 100w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-300x300.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-450x450.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-5-900x900.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Files being sent down from the ISS</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In June, Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab teams will receive certificates of participation with the exact times their programs ran on the ISS, along with the coordinates of where the ISS was above the Earth. Mission Space Lab teams will also receive a zip file with the data their programs collected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>None of this would have been possible without the hard work of all the mentors, teachers, and Code Club leaders that organise the teams of young people doing the Astro Pi missions. </p>



<p>Let’s stay curious, with our eyes upwards on that final frontier!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking for ways to keep your creators coding?</h2>

<p>In the <a href="http://rpf.io/hwp-empowering-podcastlinkblog">latest episode of the Hello World podcast</a>, Rachel Arthur, Chief Learning Officer at the Raspberry Pi Foundation, is joined by Dr. Jessica Hamer from King’s College London and Becky Patel from Tech She Can. Together, they explore the current state of girls’ engagement in computing and what we can do to support change.</p>



<p>This episode is the second in our three-part mini series on digital literacy. Each episode continues the conversations featured in the latest issue of the Hello World magazine, offering expert perspectives and practical examples from educators making a difference.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the gender gap, and why is it a problem?</strong></h2>



<p>The gender gap in computing refers to the disparity between the proportion of female and male students who choose computing as a subject or career. This is problematic because:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It reinforces harmful societal stereotypes that limit opportunities for girls</li>



<li>It hinders economic growth and innovation</li>



<li>It limits diversity in tech development, potentially leading to biased products, especially in artificial intelligence (AI)</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who are the guests on the podcast, and what will I learn?</strong></h2>



<p>To address these issues in detail, Rachel is joined by two guests who have dedicated years to understanding and addressing the gender gap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Jessica Hamer is a Research Associate at King&#8217;s College London. She transitioned to academic research after working for a decade as a science teacher in secondary education. With a focus on projects like the <a href="https://scari.sites.er.kcl.ac.uk/">SCARI project</a>, she investigates factors affecting girls&#8217; performance and participation in secondary-level computing. Her work includes a key report published last year on this topic.</p>



<p>In the <a href="http://rpf.io/hwp-empowering-podcastlinkblog">podcast</a>, Dr. Hamer reveals concerning findings about stereotypes in computing and how early they form. She explains that beliefs portraying girls as less interested in computing emerge as early as ages five or six, which significantly hinders girls’ engagement and involvement in the field.</p>



<p>Further, when students were asked to name famous figures in computing, most cited white, male tech entrepreneurs who are frequently in the news. This revealed a limited view of the kinds of people involved in computing, as well as a narrow conception of tech careers, with roles in areas like climate change and social justice being overlooked. However, Jessica highlights a key insight: <em>“We found that girls were three times more likely to suggest a female famous face”,</em> emphasising the vital importance of female representation and the need for relatable role models.</p>

<p>Becky Patel is the Head of Education and Learning at <a href="https://techshecan.org/tech-we-can">Tech She Can</a>, a UK charity focused on increasing women&#8217;s representation in technology. She has a decade of teaching experience in both primary and secondary education and now develops the ‘Tech WE Can’ educational resources, which aim to inspire all children, particularly girls, to pursue careers in technology.</p>



<p>In the <a href="http://rpf.io/hwp-empowering-podcastlinkblog">podcast</a>, Becky emphasises the importance of early intervention to address gender stereotypes. She advocates for introducing children to a wide range of STEM careers, and to do this not just in computing lessons but across the whole curriculum. <br><br>Another key strategy Becky highlights is showing children that they can explore their hobbies and interests further through technology, even when at first glance it might seem that technology can’t play a role. She explains:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>“There are so many tech roles which you can do working behind the scenes, training the athlete, helping them with health and physiotherapy, working on goal-line technology… There&#8217;s so many cool things and when you show children this, you see the attention. You see them sit up like, hold on, she&#8217;s talking about me and the thing I love. And she&#8217;s also talking about computing.”&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More to discover next week</strong></h2>



<p>Next week, in the final podcast in our mini series, we’ll be looking at the notion of the ‘digital native’. Are young people truly tech-savvy, or are they simply reliant on digital tools without understanding the underlying mechanics?</p>

<p>An increasing number of frameworks describe the possible contents of a K–12 artificial intelligence (AI) curriculum and suggest possible learning activities (for example, see the <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000391105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UNESCO competency framework for students</a>, 2024). In our March seminar, Lukas Höper and Carsten Schulte from the Department of Computing Education at Paderborn University in Germany shared with us a unit of work they’ve developed that could inform such a curriculum. At its core, the unit enhances young people’s awareness of how their personal data is used in the data-driven technologies that form part of their everyday lives.</p>

<p>Lukas Höper and Carsten Schulte are part of a larger team who are investigating how to teach school students about data science and Big Data.</p>



<p>Carsten explained that Germany&#8217;s informatics (computing) curriculum includes a competency area known as Informatics, People and Society (IPS), which explores the interrelationships between technology, individuals, and society, and how computation influences and is influenced by social, ethical, and cultural factors. However, research has suggested that teachers face several problems in delivering this topic, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Lack of subject knowledge&nbsp;</li>



<li>Lack of teaching material</li>



<li>Lack of integration with other topics in informatics lessons</li>



<li>A perception that IPS is the responsibility of other subjects</li>
</ul>



<p>Some of the findings of that 2007 research were mirrored in a more recent local study in 2025, which found that although there have been some gains in subject knowledge in the interval period, the problems of a lack of teaching material and integration with other computer science (CS) topics persist, with IPS increasingly perceived as the responsibility of the informatics subject area alone. Despite this, within the informatics curriculum, IPS is often the first topic to be dropped when educators face time constraints — and concerns with what and how to assess the topic remain.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="500" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-36-500x500.png" alt="Photo focused on a young person working on a computer in a classroom." class="wp-image-89304" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-36-500x500.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-36-250x250.png 250w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-36-150x150.png 150w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-36-768x768.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-36-800x800.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-36-100x100.png 100w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-36-300x300.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-36-450x450.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-36-900x900.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-36-400x400.png 400w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-36-600x600.png 600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Untitled-design-36.png 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>In this context, and as part of a larger, longitudinal project to promote data science teaching in schools called <a href="http://www.prodabi.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ProDaBi</a>, Carsten and Lukas have been developing, implementing, and evaluating concepts and materials on the topics of data science and AI. Lukas explained the importance of students developing <em>data awareness</em> in the context of the digital systems they use in their everyday lives, such as search engines, streaming services, social media apps, digital assistants, and chatbots, and emphasised the difference between being a user of these systems and a <em>data-aware</em> user. Using the example of image recognition and ‘I am not a robot’ Captcha services, Lukas explained how young people need to develop a data-aware perspective of the secondary purposes of the data collected by these (and other) systems, as well as the more obvious, primary purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lukas went on to illustrate the human interaction system model, which presents a continuum of possible different roles, from the student as the <em>user</em> of digital artefacts to the student as the <em>designer</em> of digital artefacts.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="303" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image3-800x303.png" alt=" Figure 1.

<p>To become data-aware users of digital artefacts, students need to be able to understand and reflect on those digital artefacts. Only then can they proceed to become responsible designers of digital artefacts. However, when surveyed, some students were only moderately interested in engaging with the inner workings of the digital technologies they use in their everyday lives. Many students prefer to use the systems and are less interested in how they process data.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The explanatory model approach in computing education</strong></h2>



<p>Lukas explained how students often become more interested in data-driven technologies when learning about them with explanatory models. Such models can foster data awareness, giving students a different perspective of data-driven technologies and helping them become more empowered users of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To illustrate, Lukas gave the example of an explanatory model about the role of data in digital systems. Such a model can be used to introduce the idea that data is explicitly and implicitly collected in the interaction between the user and the technology, and used for primary and secondary purposes.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="443" height="590" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image4.png" alt="The four parts of the explanatory model." class="wp-image-89896" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image4.png 443w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image4-188x250.png 188w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Figure 2. The four parts of the explanatory model</em></strong></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Lukas then introduced two teaching units that were developed for use with middle school children to evaluate the success of the explanatory model approach in computing education. The first unit explores location data collected by mobile phone networks and the second features recommendation systems used by movie streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.</p>



<p>Taking the second unit as their focus, Lukas and Carsten outlined the four parts of the explanatory model approach:&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Part 1</h3>



<p>The teaching unit begins by introducing recommendation systems and asking students to think about what a streaming service is, how a personalised start page is constructed, and how personal recommendations might be generated. Students then complete an unplugged activity to simulate the process of making movie recommendations for a peer:</p>



<p>Task 1: Students write down movie recommendations for another student.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Task 2: They then ask each other questions (they collect data).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Task 3: They write down revised movie recommendations.</p>



<p>Task 4: They share and evaluate their recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Task 5: Together they reflect on which collected data was helpful in this exercise and what kind of data a recommendation system might collect. This reflection introduces the concepts of explicit and implicit data collection.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Part 2</h3>



<p>In part 2, students are given a prepared Jupyter Notebook, which allows them to explore a simulation of a recommendation system. Students rate movies and receive personal recommendations. They reconstruct a data model about users, using the idea of collaborative filtering with the k-nearest neighbours algorithm (see Figure 3).&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-blog-entry"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="318" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image5-800x318.png" alt="Figure 3. Data model of movie ratings" class="wp-image-89897" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image5-800x318.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image5-300x119.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image5-500x199.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image5-768x305.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image5-450x179.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image5-900x358.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image5.png 959w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong><em>Figure 3. Data model of movie ratings</em></strong></figcaption></figure></div>


<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Part 3</h3>



<p>In part 3, the concepts of primary and secondary purposes for data collection are introduced. Students discuss examples of secondary purposes such as personalised paywalls for movies that can be purchased, and subscriptions based on the predictions of future behaviour. The discussion includes various topics about individual and societal issues (e.g. filter bubbles, behaviour engineering, information asymmetry, and responsible development of data-driven technologies).&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Part 4</h3>



<p>Finally, students use the explanatory model as an ‘analytical lens’. They choose other examples from their everyday lives of technologies that implement recommendation systems and analyse these examples, assessing the data practices involved. Students present their results in class and discuss their role in these situations and possible actions they can take to become more empowered, data-aware users.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Uses of explanatory models</h2>



<p>Using the explanatory model is one approach to make the Informatics, People and Society strand of the German informatics curriculum more engaging for students, and addresses some of the problems teachers identify with delivering this competency area.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="356" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/image3-500x356.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-89074" style="width:500px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/image3-500x356.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/image3-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/image3-450x321.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/image3.jpg 720w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>In presenting the idea of the explanatory model, Carsten and Lukas emphasised that the model in use <em>delivers content</em> as well as functioning as<em> a tool to design teaching content</em>. In the example above, we see how the explanatory model introduces the concepts of:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Explicit and implicit data collection</li>



<li>Primary and secondary purposes of that data&nbsp;</li>



<li>Data models&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>The explanatory model framework can also be used as a focus for academic research in computing education. For example, further research is needed to evaluate if explanatory models are appropriate or ‘correct’ models and to determine the extent to which they are useful in computing education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In summary, an explanatory model provides a specific perspective on and explanation of particular computing concepts and digital artefacts. In the example given here, the model focuses on the role of data in a recommender system. Explanatory models are representations of concepts, artefacts, and socio-technical systems, but can also serve as tools to support teaching and learning processes and research in computing education.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>



<p>We are thrilled to announce that the Raspberry Pi Foundation (RPF) has been accepted as a member of UNESCO’s Global Education Coalition (GEC).&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="802" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1.jpeg" alt="Global Education Coalition." class="wp-image-89794" style="width:742px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1.jpeg 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-300x150.jpeg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-500x251.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-768x385.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-1536x770.jpeg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-800x400.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-450x226.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-900x451.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div>


<p>Initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when 1.6 billion learners were shut out of the classroom, the GEC aimed to provide continuity of education in times of crisis. Since then, the Coalition has grown into a global multistakeholder network, and we are proud to help drive education transformation and accelerate the path to achieving <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/sdgs">UNESCO’s Sustainable Development</a> Goal 4 (SDG 4 – Quality Education).</p>



<p>UNESCO’s vision to transform education for the world’s most underserved aligns with our mission at the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Being part of the Coalition enables us to work together to achieve this shared aim.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to being part of the GEC, we have been invited to join the Digital Transformation Collaborative (DTC), a tech-focused subgroup that empowers educators and education leaders to include emerging technologies in their teaching practices and decision-making through capacity building and training.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coalition achievements</strong></h2>



<p>We’re joining a coalition that has already achieved a lot. Having attended the GEC annual conference last week in Paris, Ms Stefania Giannini, UNESCO Assistant Director-General for Education, stated that to date the GTC has:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Helped over 858,898 youth develop skills that make them more employable</li>



<li>Trained 794,580 teachers</li>



<li>Offered learning resources to more than 1,000,000 learners studying foundational subjects, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics</li>



<li>Reached 2,459,192 of the most marginalised girls and women</li>
</ul>



<p>Source: <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/global-education-coalition">https://www.unesco.org/en/global-education-coalition</a></p>



<p>Whilst these are amazing achievements to celebrate, there is still more work to do, with Ms Giannini also highlighting that there are currently 251 million children and youth out of school and that 44 million more teachers are needed for universal primary and secondary education by 2030.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital Transformation Collaborative</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Our commitment to the Coalition</strong></p>



<p>The Digital Transformation Collaborative (DTC), which the Foundation has committed to support, aims to play a crucial role in shaping the future of education through technology. The group has established a framework structured around six core pillars:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Coordination and leadership</li>



<li>Connectivity and infrastructure</li>



<li>Cost and sustainability</li>



<li>Capacity and culture</li>



<li>Content and solutions</li>



<li>Data and evidence</li>
</ol>



<p>Through our work at the Foundation, we believe we have the expertise to provide meaningful support through the sharing of our expertise across these issues. Many of these are challenges we work to overcome through the delivery of our programmes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We often believe we understand the meaning of ‘digital literacy’, but it can be a misleading term. Do we mean digital skills? Online safety? Where does AI fit in? As computer science education evolves to meet the needs of our increasingly digital world, we believe that true digital literacy empowers young people to engage with technology thoughtfully, critically, and confidently.</p>



<p>In this issue of Hello World, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org//hello-world/issues/26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">out today for free</a>, we discuss what digital literacy means, how it is taught in different countries around the world, and how educators are rethinking digital literacy for their students and themselves.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital literacy</strong></h2>



<p>As the use of digital technology grows, a broader view of digital literacy is necessary. Digital literacy is more than knowing how to use software. It’s the ability to use digital technologies effectively, safely, and responsibly.</p>



<p>In Issue 26 of Hello World, we explore this topic in detail and hear insights from educators across the world, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Becci Peters shares how Computing at School (CAS) in the UK is supporting digital literacy skills for students and educators</li>



<li>Sourav Pattanayak discusses how digital literacy is defined in India, and the formal and informal ways educators are teaching digital literacy</li>



<li>Sandra Hartman explores strategies for enhancing digital literacy in the US</li>



<li>Gavin Davenport asks what would happen if we considered digital literacy in the same way as we consider traditional literacy</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New podcast series in audio and video</strong></h2>



<p>We’re also pleased to announce that the Hello World podcast has returned alongside the magazine with a miniseries also focused on digital literacy.</p>



<p>We asked for your thoughts on the podcast in our previous annual survey, and you kindly sent us lots of helpful feedback. Based on that, we’re trialling new episode formats, welcoming additional hosts, and bringing in more expert voices from around the world.</p>



<p>On Tuesday 15 April we’ll be releasing our first teacher tips episode, a shorter podcast with 3 teachers sharing practical, actionable tips for improving digital literacy in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The week after, Tuesday 22 April, you’ll be able to hear a brilliant conversation between the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s Chief Learning Officer, Rachel Arthur, and two special guests: Dr Jessica Hamer from King&#8217;s College London&#8217;s School of Education, Communication and Society, and Becky Patel from Tech She Can. They’ll be discussing the current state of girls’ engagement in computing — a wide-reaching and important conversation exploring how we can empower more girls in computing through school, university and their careers.</p>



<p>Then on Tuesday 29 April the final episode in the miniseries will be a panel debate about “digital natives” where we’ll be asking, ‘Are young people who grew up with technology around them truly tech-savvy, or are they dependent on digital tools without understanding how they work?’ James Robinson — Senior Learning Manager here at the Raspberry Pi Foundation and regular host of the podcast — will lead this discussion as global educators debate the myth of the &#8220;digital native,&#8221; uncover how it could overlook complex issues of access, skills, and education, and consider what it really takes to be tech-smart in the modern world.</p>

<p>Teaching about artificial intelligence (AI) is a growing challenge for educators around the world. In our current seminar series, we are gaining insights from international computing education researchers on how to teach about AI and data science in the classroom. In our second seminar, Franz Jetzinger from the Technical University of Munich, Germany, presented his work on supporting teachers to integrate AI into their classrooms. Franz brings a wealth of relevant experience to his research as an accomplished textbook author and K–12 computer science teacher.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="629" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-500x629.jpeg" alt="A photo of Franz Jetzinger in a library. " class="wp-image-89766" style="width:460px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-500x629.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-199x250.jpeg 199w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-768x967.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-800x1007.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-450x566.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-900x1133.jpeg 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image.jpeg 1125w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>


<p>Franz started by demonstrating how widespread AI systems and technologies are becoming. He argued that embedding lessons about AI in the classroom presents three challenges:&nbsp;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>What</strong> to teach (defining AI and learning content)</li>



<li><strong>How</strong> to teach (i.e. appropriate pedagogies)</li>



<li><strong>How to prepare teachers</strong> (i.e. effective professional development)&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>As various models and frameworks for teaching about AI already exist, Franz’s research aims to address the second and third challenges — there is a notable lack of empirical evidence integrating AI in K–12 settings or teacher professional development (PD) to support teachers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Using professional development to help prepare teachers</strong></h2>



<p>In Bavaria, computer science (CS) has been a compulsory high school subject for over 20 years. However, a recent update has brought compulsory CS lessons (including AI) to Year 11 students (15–16 years old). Competencies targeted in the new curriculum include defining AI, explaining the functionality of different machine learning algorithms, and understanding how artificial neurons work.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1280" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04.jpg" alt="Two students are seated at a desk, collaborating on a computing task." class="wp-image-87821" style="width:640px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04.jpg 1920w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/07/ICS_Discovery-day-Queen-Mary_6.7.22-04-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></figure></div>


<p>To help prepare teachers to effectively teach this new curriculum and about AI, Franz and colleagues derived a set of core competencies to be used along with existing frameworks (e.g. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33019795">the Five Big Ideas of AI</a>) and the Bavarian curriculum. The PD programme Franz and colleagues developed was shaped by a set of key design principles:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Blended learning</strong>: A blended format was chosen to address the need for scalability and limited resources and to enable self-directed and active learning&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Dual-level pedagogy (or ‘pedagogical double-decker’)</strong>: Teachers were taught with the same materials to be used in the classroom to aid familiarity</li>



<li><strong>Advanced organiser</strong>: A broad overview document was created to support teachers learning new topics&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Moodle</strong>: An online learning platform was used to enable collaboration and communication via a MOOC (massive open online course)</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Analysing the effectiveness of the PD programme</strong></h2>



<p>Over 300 teachers attended the MOOC, which had an introductory session beforehand and a follow-up workshop. The programme’s effectiveness was evaluated with a pre/post assessment where teachers completed a survey of 15 closed, multiple-choice questions on their AI competencies and knowledge. Pre/post comparisons showed teachers’ scores improved significantly having taken part in the PD. This is surprising as a large proportion of participants achieved high pre-scores, indicating a highly motivated cohort with notable prior experience teaching about AI.</p>



<p>Additionally, a group of teachers (<em>n</em>=9) were invited to give feedback on which aspects of the PD programme they felt contributed to the success of implementing the curriculum in the classroom. They reported that the PD programme supported content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge well, but they required additional support to design suitable learning assessments.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Using action research to aid AI teaching&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>A separate strand of Franz’s research focuses on the other key challenge of how to effectively teach about AI. Franz engaged teachers (<em>n</em>=14) in action research, a method whereby teachers engage in classroom-based research projects. The project explored what topic-specific difficulties students faced during the lessons and how teachers adapted their teaching to overcome these challenges.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="864" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-89754" style="width:760px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-300x162.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-500x270.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-768x415.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-1536x829.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-800x432.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-450x243.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/04/image-1-900x486.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The AI curriculum in Bavaria</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Findings revealed that students struggled with determining whether AI would benefit certain tasks (e.g. object recognition, text-to-speech) or not (e.g. GPS positioning, sorting data). Franz and colleagues reasoned that students were largely not aware of how AI systems deal with uncertainty and overestimated their capabilities. Therefore, an important step in teaching students about AI is defining ‘what an AI problem is’.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1225" height="816" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4.png" alt="A teenager learning computer science." class="wp-image-83499" style="width:644px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4.png 1225w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-300x200.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-500x333.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-768x512.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-800x533.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-450x300.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2023/03/image4-900x600.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1225px) 100vw, 1225px" /></figure></div>


<p>Similarly, students struggled with distinguishing between rule-based and data-driven approaches, believing in some cases that a trained model becomes ‘rule-based’ or that all data models are data-driven. Students also struggled with certain data science concepts, such as hyperparameter, overfitting and underfitting, and information gain. Franz’s team argue that the chosen tool, Orange Data Mining, did not provide an appropriate scaffold for encountering these concepts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, teachers found challenges in bringing real-world examples into the classroom, including the use of reinforcement learning and neural networks. Franz and colleagues reasoned that focusing on the function of neural networks, as opposed to their structure, would aid student understanding. The use of high-quality (i.e. well-prepared) real-world data sets was also suggested as a strategy for bridging theoretical ideas with practical examples.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Addressing the challenges of teaching AI</strong></h2>



<p>Franz’s research provides important insights into the discipline-specific challenges educators face when introducing AI into the classroom. It also underscores the importance of appropriate professional development and age-appropriate and research-informed materials and tools to support students engaging with ideas about AI, data science, and machine learning.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation has been working in India since 2018 to enable young people to realise their potential through the power of computing and digital technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve supported Code Clubs, partnered with government organisations, and designed and delivered a complete computing curriculum for students in grades 6 to 12 and at the undergraduate level. Our curriculum is tailored to the Indian context, and we provide extensive support to help teachers deliver it effectively.</p>

<p>In another <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/computing-curriculum-framework-adapting-to-indias-diverse-landscapes/">recent blog</a>, we shared in detail how we’ve created an impactful curriculum for India. We&#8217;re now excited to share our new report evaluating how our curriculum is being taught in Telangana and Odisha. This report demonstrates the impact we&#8217;ve had so far, highlighting our successes and the key lessons we have learnt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key findings from the evaluation</strong></h2>



<p>Our evaluations of how the curriculum is being taught show that teachers are well-equipped to deliver the curriculum and provide high-quality and accessible learning experiences that develop students’ computing knowledge and skills.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="767" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR.jpg" alt="A group of students in a classroom." class="wp-image-89141" style="width:706px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR-300x230.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR-500x384.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR-768x589.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR-800x614.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR-450x345.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2024/12/IMG_20240927_150327741_HDR-900x690.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>In Telangana, we partnered with the Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TGSWREIS) to introduce our curriculum at the Coding Academy School and Coding Academy College. Our report found that all school and college teachers we trained agreed they felt confident teaching students using the resources provided. Students were very positive about the classes, and their assessment scores demonstrated strong learning outcomes: 77% of school students and 70% of college students achieved at least 60% of available marks.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>In Odisha, we worked with Learning Links Foundation and Quest Alliance, in partnership with Panchasakha Sikhya Setu (PSS) Abhiyan, to deliver the IT and Coding Curriculum (Kaushali) to students in grades 9 and 10. Our findings were also very positive:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>87% of teacher respondents agreed that the curriculum resources were high quality and useful for their teaching</li>



<li>91% felt more confident about teaching IT and coding due to the curriculum resources</li>



<li>93% of teachers agreed that the training helped them understand the curriculum&#8217;s structure, content, and objectives</li>



<li>89% felt confident in teaching the curriculum after the training</li>



<li>Teachers also reported a positive impact on their students, with almost all agreeing that it improved students&#8217; coding skills, digital literacy, and understanding of responsible digital citizenship</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1370" height="742" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-89729" style="width:628px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1.png 1370w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1-300x162.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1-500x271.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1-768x416.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1-800x433.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1-450x244.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/image-1-900x487.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1370px) 100vw, 1370px" /></figure></div>


<p>The report also highlights how students better understood how computing and coding are used in the world and developed an increased interest in pursuing careers in these fields.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key factors for effective implementation</strong></h2>



<p>Our evaluations show the importance of several factors when launching a computing curriculum:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Aligning content with students&#8217; experience and interests:</strong> Content should be tailored to students&#8217; existing knowledge, culturally relevant, and follow industry standards to prepare them for employment</li>



<li><strong>Providing extensive support to teachers:</strong> This includes careful selection and training of master teachers, comprehensive training for teachers that considers their knowledge and experience, and ongoing support through webinars, calls, and classroom observations</li>



<li><strong>Ensuring sufficient quantity and quality of infrastructure:</strong> Adequate equipment and internet access are crucial for effective teaching and learning</li>
</ul>



<p>We are committed to always improving our approach to ensure that all young people in India have the opportunity to learn about computing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Join us in shaping the future</strong></h2>

<p>I am delighted to announce Experience CS, a free, integrated computer science curriculum for elementary and middle school students (8–14 years old) that will be available in June 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experience CS enables educators to teach computer science through a standards-aligned curriculum that integrates computer science concepts and knowledge into core subjects like maths, science, languages, and the arts.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="651" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025.jpg" alt="An educator helps students with a coding task." class="wp-image-89708" style="width:690px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-500x326.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-800x521.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-450x293.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_025-900x586.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>This cross-curricular and integrated approach is one of the most effective ways to provide younger students with an introduction to computer science and is increasingly important as the impact of digital technology reaches every corner of our lives. We also know that embedding CS in real-world contexts helps make it meaningful and relevant for students, which is essential if we are going to inspire kids from different backgrounds to want to learn more about computer science and technology.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Built by educators, for educators&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The team behind Experience CS includes educators with significant experience of teaching CS in elementary and middle school settings and everything we do is being informed by the world&#8217;s leading research into effective pedagogy as well as extensive testing and research in classrooms. This won&#8217;t stop when we launch. We will continue to develop and improve the curriculum and resources in response to feedback from teachers and students.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="668" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020.jpg" alt="Two students use computers in a classroom." class="wp-image-89706" style="width:694px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020-450x301.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_020-900x601.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>One of the most important design principles for Experience CS is that it can be used by any educator. You don&#8217;t need a CS qualification or any previous experience in teaching CS classes to deliver engaging and creative learning experiences for your students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will provide lesson plans, classroom resources, and an online platform that is designed to be easy and safe to use. We will also provide educators with professional development to help build their confidence, knowledge, and skills. You don&#8217;t need to adapt or amend the resources to use them, but you will be able to if you want to. We trust teachers to know what is best for their classrooms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A creative and safe learning experience&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Crucially, Experience CS will be a creative learning experience. We&#8217;ve all seen those apps and platforms that purport to teach computer science by having young people direct their favourite pop culture character around a maze. While those types of games can be fun, we think that they fail to convey the creative potential of computer science and leave more students feeling &#8220;why bother&#8221; rather than being inspired to learn more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why Experience CS includes self-directed creative projects using the popular programming platform Scratch, with clear instructions and endless opportunities for young people to express themselves creatively.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="668" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_027.jpg" alt="Students use their laptops in a classroom, supervised by a teacher. " class="wp-image-89715" style="width:702px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_027.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_027-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_027-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_027-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_027-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_027-450x301.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_027-900x601.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>We know that online safety is the most important consideration for schools, teachers, and parents, which is why we have built a version of Scratch that is safe for schools. That means it won&#8217;t have the community and sharing features that are so central to the full Scratch platform. It will come with simple and intuitive classroom management features that enable teachers to create accounts, set assignments, review progress, and provide feedback to students.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Free forever, for everyone</strong></h2>



<p>Our promise is that Experience CS will be available for teachers and students anywhere in the world to use for free, for as long as you need it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially, we are developing the curriculum and resources for the US and Canadian education systems and we will be mapping the lessons to national and local standards in both countries. The materials will all be available in English, French, and Spanish. We will also be focusing our professional development and support for schools in the US and Canada, including working with a fantastic network of educational partners.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building on the legacy of CS First</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></h2>



<p>We are delighted that Experience CS is supported by Google and that we are able to build on the fantastic work that they have done over many years to support educators and students through CS First.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google has today announced that CS First will no longer be available from June 30, 2025 and that they are recommending that their users should move over to Experience CS for the next school year. That is a huge vote of confidence from a team that really knows what they are talking about. I want to pay tribute to everyone at Google who has worked so hard over the years to support teachers and inspire students through CS First.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are looking forward to working with all of the CS First community to make sure that you are supported through the transition and set up ready to go for the start of the new school year. You can find out more about the support we will be offering by registering <a href="https://experience-cs.org/?utm_source=rpf&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=exp-cs-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>As adults, it’s easy for us to see the impact technology has had on society and on our lives. Yet when I tell pupils that, within my lifetime, it wasn’t always illegal to hold your mobile phone to your ear and have a call while driving, they are horrified. They are living in the now and don’t yet have the perspective to allow them to see the change that has happened.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the greater understanding we now have of technology and its impact, we can better learn from previous mistakes, make decisions around ethical behaviour (such as whether to use a phone while driving), and critically engage in real-world issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As teachers, allocating some time to this topic throughout the year can seem challenging, but by implementing a few small changes, the benefits might be more than you imagine. Here are three ways you can help your students explore the impact of technology.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Change the format of your lessons by stepping away from devices&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>As teachers know, some computing lessons work best when students don’t use devices, whether it’s a matter of students designing programs before starting to code them, drawing&nbsp; maps of their school network, or discussing the implications of bias in AI training models. It’s important that learners recognise that computers are tools — sometimes they allow us to do and achieve great things, but sometimes there are other approaches that are more suitable.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1778" height="1170" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024.jpg" alt="A group of young people investigate computer hardware together." class="wp-image-81490" style="width:682px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024.jpg 1778w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-500x329.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-768x505.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-1536x1011.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-800x526.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-450x296.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/09/ATHENS_CODE_CLUB_024-900x592.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1778px) 100vw, 1778px" /></figure></div>


<p>Spending time discussing the impact of technology can help learners decide for themselves when technology is an asset, and when it is a burden. Another advantage of changing the format of your computing lessons away from device usage is that they may appeal to a wider range of students. While some students may not be interested in using technology, they may enjoy debating ethics, discussing world events, or finding solutions to real-world problems — all of which can take centre stage in a more discussion-focused computing lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach can also demonstrate to your class that lots of different skill sets are needed in the computing industry, and inspire your learners to consider career paths they might have otherwise dismissed. In addition, open, discussion-based lessons can give your learners food for thought, encouraging them to approach tasks in subsequent lessons with a greater appreciation of broader issues — whether they’re designing a program, deciding what features to build into a website, or how to structure a database.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Connect your lessons to real-world events</strong></h3>



<p>Young people exist in an interesting space when it comes to world events. Even if they’re not engaged in current affairs, they’ll probably still encounter a lot of content about what’s happening in the world. They may see snippets of news footage on television, hear adults talking about a big event, or — with so much of their lives now happening online — stumble across trending stories and associated opinions while using social media, apps, and websites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-scaled.jpg" alt="Close up of two young people working at a computer." class="wp-image-89303" style="width:684px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/01/Hills-Road-Dojo__22-01-23-36-1-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure></div>


<p>Young people will often try to make sense of all these bits of information, filling in the blanks. The problem is that if we don’t talk to young people about what they’re hearing, they may fill in the blanks incorrectly. Before you know it, they might be anxious that artificial intelligence will take over the world, or that adults hate TikTok for no reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s important to equip young people with the skills to think about real-world events — and developments related to technology — critically and calmly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Headlines such as “Why the USA is banning TikTok” or self-help articles with titles like “Why muting people on social media will change your life” could make brilliant focus points for a lesson or activity about the impact of technology. Discussing these kinds of headlines and articles can help your learners consider their own opinions, apply what they know about how technology works, and gain a sense of grounding in our often turbulent world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By encouraging your learners to articulate what they know and apply it to real-world situations, you’ll enrich their computing education while also nurturing responsible digital citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Encourage students to have difficult conversations</strong></h3>



<p>The role of a computing teacher is often broad. Beyond curriculum and teaching responsibilities, it will usually involve providing tech support (changing ink in printers, for instance) and dealing with safeguarding incidents that have happened between pupils at the weekend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Safeguarding is a key part of teaching. Effective safeguarding should include teaching your learners about what to do in difficult scenarios, like when a WhatsApp group goes awry, when an image is shared on social media when it shouldn’t have been, or when a game becomes popular that your learners aren’t old enough to play.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541.jpeg" alt="Computing teachers often have to be prepared with a lesson to deal with safeguarding incidents, such as a WhatsApp group gone awry." class="wp-image-89641" style="width:669px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541.jpeg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541-500x334.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_782584541-900x600.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Computing teachers often have to be prepared with a lesson to deal with safeguarding incidents, such as a WhatsApp group gone awry.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Each of these scenarios is an example of technology’s impact on our lives. It’s important that your learners know how to deal with these scenarios and can have different opinions while talking and listening to each other. Also, if your learners can do these things, it will make things easier in the future if you need to talk to a particular learner about something inappropriate they’ve done.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By encouraging your learners to have difficult conversations, you’ll practise how to navigate the tension between legality, rules from home, and best-practice advice from external sources. You’ll also have lessons that you can refer back to: “Remember when we were discussing the TikTok ban? How might some of those conversations relate to this situation? What about when we discussed when to block people on games or on social media? Would that be appropriate here?”&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Raising awareness that the impact of technology can enrich lessons</strong></h2>



<p>Technology is going to continue to impact the lives of the pupils we work with, whether they can recognise that or not. Increasing their awareness of the impact technology is having, in both positive and negative ways, will enrich your lessons, show that content is relevant to your learners, and help protect them when they have to make their own critical decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are suggestions in this article to use with learners of all ages, but if you want more support on how to teach the topic with older learners, we have an online course for educators (<strong>helloworld.cc/impactoftech</strong>) and a unit of work for 14-year-olds (<strong>helloworld.cc/ks4impact</strong>).</p>
