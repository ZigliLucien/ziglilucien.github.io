<p>In our April research seminar, David Weintrop, Rotem Israel-Fishelson, and Peter Moon from the University of Maryland introduced <a href="https://apicancode.umd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">API Can Code</a>, a data science curriculum designed with high school students for high school students. Their talk explored how their innovative work uses real-world data and students&#8217; own experiences and interests to create meaningful, authentic learning experiences in data science.</p>



<p><strong><em>Quick note for educators</em></strong>: Are you interested in joining our free, exploratory data science education workshop for teachers on 10 July 2025 in Cambridge, UK? Then <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/join-our-free-data-science-education-workshop-for-teachers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find out the details here</a>.</p>



<p>David started by explaining the motivation behind the API Can Code project. The team’s goal was not to turn students into future data scientists, but to offer students the data literacy they need to explore and critically engage with a data-driven world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The work was also guided by a shared view among leading teachers’ organisations that data science should be taught across all subjects in the K–12 curriculum. It also draws on strong research showing that when educational experiences connect with students’ own lives and interests, it leads to deeper engagement and better learning outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reviewing the landscape</strong></h2>



<p>To prepare for the design of the curriculum, David, Rotem, and Peter wanted to understand what data science education options already exist for K–12 students. Rotem described how they compared four major K–12 data science curricula and examined different aspects, such as the topics they covered and the datasets they used. Their findings showed that many datasets were quite small in size, and that the datasets used were not always about topics that students were interested in.</p>

<p>The team also looked at 30 data science tools used across different K–12 platforms and analysed what each could do. They found that tools varied in how effective they were and that many lacked accessibility features to support students with diverse learning needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This analysis helped to refine the team&#8217;s objective: to create a data science curriculum that students find interesting and that is informed by their values and voices.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Participatory design</strong></h2>



<p>To work towards this goal, the team used a methodology called participatory design<em>. </em>This is an approach that actively involves the end users — in this case, high school students — in the design process. During several in-person sessions with 28 students aged 15 to 18 years old, the researchers facilitated low-tech, hands-on activities exploring the students’ identities and interests and how they think about data.</p>



<p>One activity, Empathy Map, involved students working together to create a persona representing a student in their school. They were asked to describe the persona’s daily life, interests, and concerns about technology and data:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The students’ involvement in the design process gave the team a better understanding of young people’s views and interests, which helped create the design of the API Can Code curriculum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>API Can Code: three units, three key tools</strong></h2>



<p>Peter provided an overview of the API Can Code curriculum. It follows a three-unit flow covering different concepts and tools in each unit:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Unit 1</strong> introduces students to different types of data and data science terminology. The unit explores the role of data in the students’ daily lives, how use and misuse of data can affect them, different ways of collecting and presenting data, and how to evaluate databases for aspects such as size, recency, and trustworthiness. It also introduces them to <a href="https://rapidapi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>RapidAPI</em></strong></a>, a hub that connects to a wide range of APIs from different providers, allowing students to access real-world data such as Zillow housing prices or Spotify music data.</li>



<li><strong>Unit 2 </strong>covers the computing skills used in data science, including the use of programming tools to run efficient data science techniques. Students learn to use <a href="https://edublocks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>EduBlocks</em></strong></a><strong>, </strong>a block-based programming environment where students can draw in JSON files from RapidAPI datasets, and process and filter data without needing a lot of text-based programming skills. The students also compare this approach with manual data processing, which they discover is very slow.</li>



<li><strong>Unit 3 </strong>focuses on data analysis, visualisation, and interpretation. Students use <a href="https://codap.concord.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>CODAP</em></strong></a>, a web-based interactive data science tool, to calculate summary statistics, create graphs, and perform analyses. CODAP is a user-friendly but powerful platform, making it perfect for students to analyse and visualise their data sets. Students also practise interpreting pre-made graphs and the graphs and statistics that they are creating.</li>
</ol>



<p>Peter described an example activity carried out by the students, showing how these three units flow together and build both technical skills and an understanding of the real-world uses of data science. Students were tasked with analysing a dataset from Zillow, a property website, to explore the question “How much does a house in my neighbourhood cost?” The images below show the process the students followed, which uses the data science skills and tools from all three units of the curriculum.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Interest-driven learning in action</strong></h2>



<p>A central tenet of API Can Code is that students should explore data that matters to them. A diverse range of student interests was identified during the design work, and the curriculum uses these areas of interest, such as music, movies, sports, and animals, throughout the lessons.</p>



<p>The curriculum also features an open-ended final project, where students can choose a research question that is important to them and their lives, and answer it using data science skills.</p>



<p>The team shared two examples of memorable final projects. In one, a student set out to answer the question “Is Jhené Aiko a star?” The student found a publicly available dataset through an API provided by Deezer, a music streaming platform. She wrote a program that retrieved data on the artist’s longevity and collaborations, analysed the data, and concluded that Aiko is indeed a star. What stood out about this project wasn’t just the fact that the student independently defined stardom and answered their research question using real data, but that this was a truly personal, interest-driven project. David noted that the researchers could never have come up with this activity, since they had never previously heard of Jhené Aiko!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1060" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9.png" alt="Jhené Aiko, an R&amp;B singer-songwriter" class="wp-image-90480" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9.png 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-300x199.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-500x331.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-768x509.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-1536x1018.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-800x530.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-450x298.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-900x596.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Jhené Aiko, an R&amp;B singer-songwriter&nbsp;</em><br><em>(Photo by Charito Yap, licensed under </em><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>CC BY-ND 2.0</em></a><em>)</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Another student’s project analysed data about housing in Washington DC to answer the question “Which ward in DC has the most affordable houses?” Rotem explained that this student was motivated by her family thinking about moving away from the city. She wanted to use her project to persuade her parents to stay by identifying the most affordable ward in DC that they could move to. She was excited by the outcome of her project, and she presented her findings to other students and her parents.</p>



<p>These projects underscore the power of personally important data science projects driven by students’ interests. When students care about the questions they are exploring, they&#8217;re more invested in the process and more likely to keep using the skills and concepts they learn.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resources</strong></h2>



<p>API Can Code is available online and completely free to use. Teachers can access lesson plans, tutorial videos, assessment rubrics, and more from the curriculum’s website <a href="https://apicancode.umd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://apicancode.umd.edu/</a>. The site also provides resources to support students, including example programs and glossaries.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to celebrate yet another incredible year of young people reaching for the stars, as the European Astro Pi Challenge 2024/25 draws to a close. Teams from across Europe and ESA Member States are now receiving their well-deserved certificates and data from the International Space Station (ISS). It&#8217;s been a truly inspiring year, showcasing the phenomenal talent and dedication of young coders and scientists.</p>

<p>The European Astro Pi Challenge is an ESA Education project run in collaboration with us here at the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It offers young people the amazing opportunity to conduct scientific investigations in space by writing computer programs that run on Raspberry Pi computers on board the ISS, called Astro Pis.</p>



<p>There‘s a lot to celebrate from this year’s Astro Pi, so let’s take a look at some of the highlights for each of our inspiring Missions: Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1080" height="1080" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25.png" alt="A selection of images taken by Mission Space Lab teams" class="wp-image-90443" style="width:600px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25.png 1080w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-250x250.png 250w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-500x500.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-150x150.png 150w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-768x768.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-800x800.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-100x100.png 100w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-300x300.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-450x450.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-900x900.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1: A selection of images taken by Mission Space Lab teams</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mission Zero: Inspiring coding, creativity, and inclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Mission Zero reached more young people than ever before in 2024/25, with 25,405 young people participating in 17,285 teams. After passing the rigorous testing and moderation processes, an amazing 17,109 teams (25,210 young people) were successful in getting their programs to run on the ISS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the great things about Mission Zero is that we see a good gender balance in participation. This year, 44% of participants identified as “female” and 4% as “prefer to self-describe”, “prefer not to say”, or “other”. This means that Mission Zero has achieved a more balanced gender representation than is typically seen in computing subjects, where the ratio is around 20:80 girls to boys.</p>

<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mission Space Lab: More teams have their programs run in space</strong></h2>



<p>Mission Space Lab gives young people the opportunity to calculate the speed of the ISS in orbit using sensor and camera data collected from the Astro Pis on board the ISS. This year, 1859 young people in 552 teams participated in Mission Space Lab. Notably, 309 Mission Space Lab teams, or 95% of submissions, ran their programs on the ISS and are now analysing the data they collected. That’s 73 more teams achieving flight status than in 2023/24, and a total of 1084 young people receiving unique data sets from space and certificates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Running a program in space is very different from testing it on the ground. It’s always interesting to see how well your program has performed and how accurate the final output is. Below, you can see a scatter graph of the team estimates produced by their programs. The actual speed of the ISS is no secret: it’s travelling about 7.67 kilometres per second. How have teams performed with the ISS speed task?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inspiring and impactful</strong></h2>



<p>Another highlight from this year has been seeing how impactful participation can be for young people and mentors facilitating the activity. We receive lots of valuable feedback from the Astro Pi community each year, and it’s always heartwarming to hear what your experience has been and how we can improve the challenge. Here are a couple of quotes from the community who took part this year:</p>



<p>Mission Zero mentor: <em>“Having their programs run in space really motivated them to take part because it was an exciting reward and something they wanted to talk about with their friends.”</em></p>



<p>Parent of a Mission Zero participant: <em>“I was completely inexperienced in Python, but easily managed to help my 7-year-old.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More Code Clubs participating in 2024/25</strong></h2>



<p>It has been great to see lots of Code Clubs taking part in Astro Pi this year, both for Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab. This year, 986 young people from 700 teams did Mission Zero at their Code Club: that’s double the number from 2023/24. Plus, 43 Mission Space Lab teams from Code Clubs took part. That’s 143 young people, or almost double the number compared to the year before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We ran two code-alongs for the Code Club community this year, and it is encouraging to see increases for both missions. We will continue to support young people from all settings who want to take part in Astro Pi next year, whether it’s at school, Code Club, or other venues.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>In summary, it’s been a great year for Astro Pi. We’ve reached lots of young people through the challenge, met many inspiring mentors, and seen some really positive trends. Plus, all the operations on the space station that make Astro Pi possible went smoothly: when you are running programs in space, that isn’t always the case!&nbsp;</p>



<p>None of it would have been possible without the tireless efforts of the teachers, mentors, and educators who help run Astro Pi in your communities. From everyone here at Mission Control, thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’d like to tell us how we can provide more support to help you run Astro Pi, please email <a href="mailto:contact@astro-pi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact@astro-pi.org</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll be back for more stellar space adventures in coding in September 2025.</p>

<p>Code Club is a global movement of free coding clubs where school-aged young people — called creators — develop the confidence to create with digital technologies. Code Clubs take place in schools and community venues like youth clubs, libraries, and maker spaces and are run by teachers, educators, and volunteers from all walks of life — known as mentors. These incredible mentors make Code Clubs possible and we are so grateful for their hard work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>About the 2025 survey report</strong></h2>



<p>This Code Club annual survey report presents key responses from 775 mentors gathered via surveys and feedback from partners.</p>



<p>This year, <strong>7,494</strong> Code Clubs have confirmed they have been active in the last two years, with clubs in 102 countries. We estimate 257,000 creators are involved in clubs and 43% of creators are female. As one UK Code Club mentor put it: &#8220;Girls who didn&#8217;t think it was for them now have confidence&#8221;.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Code Clubs have a positive impact on young creators</strong></h2>



<p>In 2024, an <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/how-fun-filled-code-clubs-drive-learning-new-evidence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">independent evaluation</a> by the Durham University Evidence Centre for Education provided evidence of positive outcomes for young people attending Code Clubs. We are continuing to build on this evidence, with 96% of mentors responding to our surveys agreeing that creators have increased skills in computing and digital making, as well as increased confidence to engage with technology as a result of attending a Code Club.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few of the examples mentors gave of the impact Code Club has on creators:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Confidence:</strong> &#8220;[Creators become] more confident using technology and making friends. Some really come out of their shell compared to when they started.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, UK&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Skill development:</strong> “They come into the club with no coding skills (some barely know how to use a computer) and leave as competent, literate, coders.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, Canada</li>



<li><strong>Enjoyment:</strong> &#8220;One of our core principles is that coding should be fun&#8230; we give them creative ways to expand on the task. They learn to push themselves a bit beyond a task, and look for more things.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, the Netherlands&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Social skills:</strong> &#8220;One great outcome has been the socialization that occurs. Kids in our club are definitely making friendships and improving their soft skills.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, USA&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Continued participation: </strong>&#8220;It has increased their passion for tech and how to create new things to solve problems.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, Ghana</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Increasing access to technology</strong></h2>



<p>Code Club also plays an important role in increasing access to technology for creators who would otherwise not have access. We work with partners across the world to run clubs in areas of educational disadvantage to ensure that Code Clubs are available to creators from all backgrounds to address this need.</p>

<p>In some regions, Code Club provides creators with their first significant encounter with digital making. A mentor <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/global-impact-empowering-young-people-in-kenya-and-south-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in Kenya</a> told us that Code Club ensured that creators in his area were not “left behind”. A Code Club mentor in Tunisia told us&nbsp; “[&#8230;] access to coding is very limited, our club contributes to reducing this inequality”.</p>

<p>You will be among the very first educators to see some of our first test activities for teacher training to build data science concepts, and your contributions will feed into our future work. Sign up by 20 June to take part.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Data science: What do we need to teach school-age learners?</strong></h2>



<p>Current artificial intelligence (AI) methods, especially machine learning (ML), rely heavily on data. While young people learn mathematics, and some statistics, at school, data science concepts are not commonly taught.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16.jpg" alt="Teachers at a workshop." class="wp-image-90386" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/ada-event-16-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>To complement our work on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/teach/ai-education" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI literacy</a>, we have been investigating what data science teaching resources and education research are currently available.</p>



<p>Our goals for this work are:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>To figure out what data science concepts may need to be taught in schools, initially with a focus on key stage 5</li>



<li>To develop related teacher professional development and classroom resources</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Join us to discuss data science education</strong></h2>



<p>If you are interested in <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research/seminars/previous/teaching-about-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data science education</a> for young people, and maybe even have experience of teaching it to learners aged 16 to 18 in your school (in any subject, including computer science, social sciences, mathematics, statistics, and ethics), please join our free workshop on Thursday 10 July in our office in Cambridge. We are able to reimburse some travel expenses.</p>



<p>At the workshop:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>We would love to hear about your experience of teaching any elements of data science</li>



<li>We will share some exploratory concept building activities with you and discuss them together</li>

<p>Today we&#8217;re publishing a position paper setting out five arguments for why we think that kids still need to learn to code in the age of artificial intelligence.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-500x333.png" alt="A whimsical cartoon of someone struggling with vibe coding at a desktop computer and a second person with a superhero cape and a t-shirt saying 'programmer' coming to their rescue." class="wp-image-90359" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-500x333.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-300x200.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-768x512.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-800x533.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-450x300.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-900x600.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode.png 983w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Generated using ChatGPT.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Just like every wave of technological innovation that has come before, the advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are raising profound questions about the future of human work. History teaches us that technology has the potential to both automate and augment human effort, destroying some jobs and creating new ones. The only thing we know for sure is that it is impossible to predict the precise nature and pace of the changes that are coming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the fastest-moving applications of generative AI technologies are the systems that can generate code. What started as the coding equivalent of autocomplete has quickly progressed to tools that can generate increasingly complex code from natural language prompts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has given birth to the notion of &#8220;vibe-coding&#8221; and led some commentators to predict the end of the software development industry as we know it. It shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise then that there is a vigorous debate about whether kids still need to learn to code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the position paper we put forward five arguments for why we think the answer is an unequivocal yes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/about/Why-kids-still-need-to-learn-to-code-in-the-age-of-AI-2025-Raspberry-Pi-Foundation-position-paper.pdf">Download the paper</a></div>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">We need humans who are skilled programmers&nbsp;</h2>



<p>First, we argue that even in a world where AI can generate code, we need skilled human programmers who can think critically, solve problems, and make ethical decisions. The large language models that underpin these tools are probabilistic systems designed to provide statistically acceptable outputs and, as any skilled software engineer will tell you, simply writing more code faster isn&#8217;t necessarily a good thing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning to code is an essential part of learning to program</h2>



<p>Learning to code is the most effective way we know for a young person to develop the mental models and fluency to become a skilled human programmer. The hard cognitive work of reading, modifying, writing, explaining, and testing code is precisely how young people develop a deep understanding of programming and computational thinking.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning to code will open up even more opportunities in the age of AI&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While there&#8217;s no doubt that AI is going to reshape the labour market, the evidence from history suggests that it will increase the reach of programming and computational approaches across the economy and into new domains, creating demand for humans who are skilled programmers. We also argue that coding is no longer just for software engineers, it&#8217;s becoming a core skill that enables people to work effectively and think critically in a world shaped by intelligent machines. From healthcare to agriculture, we are already seeing demand for people who can combine programming with domain-specific skills and craft knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Coding is a literacy that helps young people have agency in a digital world</h2>



<p>Alongside the arguments for coding as a route to opening up economic opportunities, we argue that coding and programming gives young people a way to express themselves, to learn, and to make sense of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And perhaps most importantly, that learning to code is about power. Providing young people with a solid grounding in computational literacy, developed through coding, helps ensure that they have agency. Without it, they risk being manipulated by systems they don&#8217;t understand. As Rushkoff said: &#8220;Program, or be programmed&#8221;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The kids who learn to code will shape the future</h2>



<p>Finally, we argue that the power to create with technology is already concentrated in too small and homogenous a group of people. We need to open up the opportunity to learn to code to all young people because it will help us mobilise the full potential of human talent, will lead to more inclusive and effective digital solutions to the big global challenges we face, and will help ensure that everyone can share in the societal and economic benefits of technological progress.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The work we need to do&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We end <a href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/about/Why-kids-still-need-to-learn-to-code-in-the-age-of-AI-2025-Raspberry-Pi-Foundation-position-paper.pdf">the paper</a> with a call to action for all of us working in education. We need to challenge the false narrative that AI is removing the need for kids to learn to code, and redouble our efforts to ensure that all young people are equipped to take advantage of the opportunities in a world where AI is ubiquitous.</p>

<p>Bradford was buzzing with excitement this May as over 170 young digital makers from across the UK gathered for Coolest Projects UK 2025 at the Life Centre to celebrate the amazing things young people create with technology. Run by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and hosted by BBC science presenter Greg Foot, the free, in-person event brought together budding creators, families, mentors, and even a few troops of Scouts for a fun-filled day.</p>



<p>From AI tools and advanced programming to Scratch games and hardware builds, the showcase featured an incredible range of projects from 113 Coolest Projects participants and 58 scouts. Every young person received thoughtful feedback from industry professionals, the chance to try hands-on coding challenges, and the thrill of sharing what they built with a welcoming crowd and other creators.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A day of discovery and digital making</h2>



<p>Coolest Projects UK 2025 wasn’t just about showcasing finished products; it celebrated every part of the creative journey. Many creators shared works-in-progress or prototypes, sparking conversations around design, problem-solving, and learning through code.</p>



<p>One of the day’s highlights was an interactive escape room designed just for the event, giving attendees a chance to flex their logical thinking and collaboration skills. And for 58 visiting Scouts, the day was a chance to earn their Digital Maker Badge and share their creations with the showcase participants.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A platform for everyone</strong></h2>



<p>Many of this year’s participants came from local Code Clubs, CoderDojos, and schools across the UK. Others had worked independently to bring their ideas to life. The event encouraged collaboration and connection, with creators exchanging feedback, learning from each other, and celebrating shared interests.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, young people from Bradford also had the chance to take part in hands-on workshops. Held at the National Science and Media Museum, they were guided on getting started with digital making and developing their own project ideas for the showcase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Featured projects</strong></h2>



<p>Here are a few of the projects that were showcased on the day. Each one demonstrates the power of digital tools and the fun and creativity that young people bring to their Coolest Projects journeys. Here’s what the creators had to say about their work, what inspired them, and their experiences of the day:</p>



<p><strong>Arlo | MUST. EAT. DONUTS., AI</strong></p>



<p>Arlo’s interactive game featured AI models that used face and mouth tracking to make the main character, called Chompy, mirror the movements of the player. Arlo&#8217;s game was inspired by a session at his Code Club. He came across a video sensing motion plug-in and realised he could make a game that used the player’s head as the controller.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It is a fun and silly game for all to play. I also created the artwork myself in my own style, as drawing is another one of my passions, alongside coding. I would love to come back next year, maybe in a different category. I wanted to enter because I got the chance to share my coding and drawing skills, and I was excited to think others may play a game I created.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Felicia and Francesca | The Silent Forest, Scratch</strong></p>



<p>Felicia and Francesca created a top-down, Zelda-style RPG in Scratch, where the player explores a pixel world and interacts with characters and objects. Instead of using the keyboard, the game is controlled with a Micro:bit. Felicia shared with us why they wanted to showcase the game at Coolest Projects.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I went to Coolest Projects UK because I love making things with Scratch and wanted to show my game to other people. It was a fun way to share what I built, see what other kids made, and learn new ideas. I wanted to challenge myself and be part of something really cool!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Eesa, Yahya and Yusha | Let&#8217;s Speak Arabic!, Scratch</strong></p>



<p>Let’s Speak Arabic is an interactive program designed to help people learn conversational Arabic. Eesa, Yahya, and Yusha are home educated and study a book called <em>Al Arabiyyah Bayna Yadayk</em> together. This inspired them to think about fun ways to upgrade their study, and the idea for gamifying their learning through Scratch was born. The team shared a little about their experience:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The event was awesome. Actually, it was even better than we imagined! We loved meeting people from all over the country, really enjoyed playing other people’s games, and got lots of ideas for what we could code in the future. And, our parents were so proud we got judge’s favourite!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Jay | J Bot, Hardware</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/celebrating-the-community-jay/">Jay is a long-time friend</a> of the Foundation and has been taking part in Coolest Projects online and in person for the past few years. He wowed again this year with his life-sized J Bot and shared with us why he thinks Coolest Projects is such an important event for the young creator community.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I know it might seem a bit intimidating to come and showcase in front of all these people, but I feel more and more people should try and get involved [in Coolest Projects] because it’s a really good community of people. And they are really supportive as well. So I would just say, give it a go. Don’t be nervous because people are here to help you along the way.”</p>

<p>From smart devices to workplace tools, AI is becoming part of everyday life and a major part of how people are thinking about the future — raising big questions about access, skills, and readiness.</p>



<p>As governments around the world create AI strategies for the decade ahead, many are seeing an urgent need to address the large gap between how AI tools are already <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1161826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impacting jobs</a> and people’s lives, and making sure young people have the chance to gain the skills and knowledge to keep up with this rapid pace of technological change. This gap is larger still when it comes to opportunities for educationally underserved communities.</p>

<p>That’s why we’re excited to share how <a href="http://rpf.io/expai-gp-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI</a>, our AI literacy programme, is helping organisations around the world create these much-needed opportunities for young people.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The value of a global network</strong></h2>



<p>Experience AI was co-developed in 2022 by us and industry experts at Google DeepMind with a clear mission: to equip teachers with free, accessible, easy-to-use classroom resources that build AI literacy from the ground up. The programme offers a suite of materials to help students understand real-world applications of AI, the basics of machine learning, and the ethical considerations around these technologies.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1479" height="1600" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6.jpeg" alt="A picture of Philip Colligan delivering a talk." class="wp-image-90283" style="width:580px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6.jpeg 1479w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-231x250.jpeg 231w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-500x541.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-768x831.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-1420x1536.jpeg 1420w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-800x865.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-450x487.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-900x974.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1479px) 100vw, 1479px" /></figure></div>


<p>In 2023, we <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-canada-kenya-romania/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started building an international Experience AI network</a> by collaborating with a group of our existing educational partners. We saw a huge amount of interest and received very positive feedback, and through our partnerships we reached an estimated one million young people. In late 2024, with support from <a href="http://google.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google.org</a>, we tripled the size of our <a href="http://rpf.io/expai-gppage-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI partner network</a> to 21, with new organisations joining from across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In this way, we aim to reach an <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-expands-to-reach-over-2-million-students/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">additional 2.3 million young people by December 2026</a>, helping them to gain the knowledge and skills to confidently engage with AI in an ever-changing world.</p>



<p>Each partner in the Experience AI network is a unique educational organisation looking to create lasting social change. Through their local knowledge and networks, we can present Experience AI to educators and students in a way that is engaging and relevant for local communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Partners help us to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/localising-ai-education-adapting-experience-ai-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adapt and translate our resources</a>, all while making sure that the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/">core</a><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/explaining-ai-terms-young-people-educators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> pedagogy</a> and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-anthropomorphism/">design</a><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-were-taking-a-problem-first-approach-to-the-development-of-ai-systems/"> principles</a> of Experience AI are preserved. Just as importantly, these organisations <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/impact-of-experience-ai-in-kenya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">train thousands of teachers</a> on how to use the materials, providing educators with free support. With their work, they reach communities that otherwise may have never had the opportunity to learn about AI.</p>



<p>We asked some of our partners to share their insights on the impact Experience AI is having on the teachers and young people in their communities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building communities</strong></h2>



<p>The Latvian Safer Internet Centre (LSIC), an initiative of our partner, the <a href="https://www.lia.lv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Latvian Internet Association</a> (LIA), is dedicated to helping young people protect themselves online, and to preparing them for a fast-changing digital economy. As an Experience AI partner, they aim to train 850 teachers and support 43,000 students to build a strong foundation in AI literacy through the programme.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We hope to spark a cultural shift in how AI is […] taught in Latvian schools. Our goal is for AI literacy to become a natural part of digital competence education, not an optional extra.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based in Riga, the team is travelling to 18 different regions across Latvia to bring in-person professional development to teachers, including those in rural communities far from major cities. By meeting teachers where they are, the LIA are creating invaluable networks for learning and support between communities. Through hands-on training, they are also supporting teachers to bring Experience AI into their own classroom, creating examples which are suited for their learners.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We chose an in-person training model because it fosters a more collaborative and engaging environment, especially for teachers who are new to AI. Many educators, particularly those who are less confident with digital tools, benefit from direct interaction, real-time discussions, and the chance to ask questions in a supportive setting.” </p>
</blockquote>



<p>As an Experience AI partner, the Latvian Internet Association is not just delivering content but working to strengthen digital competency across the country and ensure that no teacher or student is left behind in Latvia’s AI journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One teacher shares: “The classroom training was truly valuable: it gave us the chance to exchange ideas and reflect on our diverse experiences. Hearing different perspectives was enriching, and I’m glad we’re shaping the future of our schools together.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>“AI is for everyone”</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.edcamp.ua/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EdCamp Ukraine</a>’s mission is to unite educators and help them to grow. Operating from their main base in Kharkiv, near the Eastern border and the frontline of the ongoing war in Ukraine, they see AI as both a tool for new technological breakthroughs and as something that can help build a fairer, more efficient, and resilient society.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We firmly believe AI should not only be an object of study — it must become a tool for amplifying human potential. AI should also not be a privilege, but a resource for everyone. We believe the Experience AI programme can truly transform education from the bottom up.”</p>

<p>Within their community of 50,000 teachers, EdCamp Ukraine ensures that every educator, regardless of their living conditions or where they work, can access high-quality, relevant, and accessible support. For the organisation, the ongoing situation in Ukraine means being flexible with planning, preparing for a range of different outcomes, and being ready to pivot delivery to different locations or to an online setting when needed. These same considerations apply to EdCamp Ukraine&#8217;s teacher community, who need to be ready to adapt their lessons for any scenario.</p>

<p>This year, the team piloted Experience AI through their community of trainers, who, when they’re not training, are busy teaching in the classroom. Teacher Yuliia shared how her students valued the opportunity to be creators, rather than just users of technology:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“One student, who is an active AI user, kept silent during the lesson. I thought he wasn’t interested, but during the reflection he shared a lot of positive feedback and expressed his gratitude. Other students said it was important that they weren’t just told about AI — they were using it, creating images, and working with apps.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A turning tide</h2>



<p>2024 was the year the tide turned against smartphones. Across the world, parents, teachers, and governments highlighted the risks of excessive phone use among young people. In the UK, the ‘Smartphone Free Childhood’ movement emerged, quickly growing to 100,000 members who advocate for keeping smartphones away from children due to concerns about addiction, harmful content, and mental health. Jonathan Haidt’s global bestseller <em>The Anxious Generation</em> has further fuelled the movement, linking smartphone use to adolescent mental health issues and recommending phonefree schools. Meanwhile, countries including England, France, and Finland have urged schools to adopt strict phone bans, hoping to reduce classroom distractions and enhance student safety.</p>

<p>Despite widespread support, academic research on phone bans remains limited and inconclusive. Given this situation, computing educators are uniquely positioned to offer an alternative approach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Evaluating evidence on phone bans&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The rapid spread of school smartphone bans is a straightforward response to complex issues around personal technology use in education. Teachers and parents frequently view phones as inherently disruptive, a perspective supported by studies that show phones can impair students’ focus and engagement in lessons. Concerns about cyberbullying and addiction contribute to this view, with many educators seeing bans as a practical solution to mitigate risks. Surveys in England reveal that nearly half of all secondary schools now enforce all-day bans. This trend was supported by teachers participating in my master’s degree research, who see these policies as necessary to reduce distractions and maintain control in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Calls for outright bans may oversimplify the conversation.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yet calls for outright bans may oversimplify the conversation, limiting opportunities to examine both the benefits and the risks of smartphone use in schools. <a href="http://helloworld.cc/smartphone-evidence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evidence on the impact of phone restrictions is mixed</a>: while some studies suggest restrictions may benefit learning, especially for students who struggle the most, others indicate no significant impact on academic outcomes. Additionally, recent findings show that cyberbullying is not directly linked to time spent online, with traditional bullying still more prevalent in schools. Even the narrative around smartphone addiction is contested, with some researchers suggesting that concerns about addiction may be overstated. And <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/teaching-digital-literacy-without-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some schools do not have access to digital devices</a> for learners and then smartphones may play a crucial role in teaching and learning digital literacy skills.</p>

<p>As the debate over smartphone bans continues, educators have an opportunity to move beyond restrictions and engage students in understanding the technology that shapes their lives. This is where computing educators can really make a difference. How can they guide students to understand why technology is designed to capture attention and what lies behind these design choices?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding and questioning the design of technology&nbsp;</h2>



<p>School smartphone bans can feel like a hopeless act that suggests phones and social media are inherently incompatible with learning and student well-being. This approach assumes the only solution is to remove them, rather than considering how these technologies might be better managed or reimagined to support young people. What if, instead of banning phones, educators worked with students to explore why they are so captivating and how they could be designed differently? Computing educators can lead this exploration. With digital literacy as part of their curriculum, computing teachers can help students question the motives behind their devices, fostering a critical understanding of the forces shaping their digital world.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;With digital literacy as part of their curriculum, computing teachers can help students question the motives behind their devices, fostering a critical understanding of the forces shaping their digital world.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the heart of how social media platforms are designed is their business models. Tech companies rely on features such as notifications, autoplay, and infinite scrolling to maximise user engagement and revenue. This is part of what the writer Shoshana Zuboff calls <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=56791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“surveillance capitalism”</a>, where companies gather vast amounts of behavioural data by keeping users engaged on their platforms for as long as possible.</p>



<p>In the classroom, educators can open discussions with students on the motives behind technology design, exploring questions such as why platforms want users to stay engaged, and what data they are collecting. Activities might include analysing popular apps to identify which features encourage prolonged use, or debating how social media could be designed to prioritise user wellbeing. By critically examining these design choices, students can better understand the forces driving their digital interactions and consider ways in which technology could be reimagined to serve them, rather than just profiting from them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Collaborative policymaking&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once young people understand why phones and social media are designed the way they are, educators can work with students to create phone policies that reflect shared values and goals. This collaborative approach encourages students to take ownership of their technology use, and computing teachers, drawing on their knowledge of technology design and digital literacy, are ideally positioned to facilitate these discussions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.renniecenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-01/2019%20Condition%20of%20Education%20Action%20Guide_Student%20Voice.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research suggests that policies developed with student input are more effective</a>, as they foster responsibility and engagement. By involving students in policymaking, educators can encourage them to consider how phones could support rather than hinder learning. For example, students might agree that phones should stay off during certain times, or in certain spaces, but that they might be useful in other scenarios where access benefits learning. This kind of flexibility ensures that phones are used thoughtfully, allowing for both practical boundaries and opportunities for educational use.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Critical skills for navigating the digital world</h2>



<p>As debate around smartphone use in schools continues, academic research remains inconclusive on the effectiveness of phone bans. This uncertainty presents computing educators with an opportunity to move beyond restrictive policies and foster deeper understanding. By guiding students to explore why phones and social media are designed to capture attention, we can help to equip them with the critical skills needed to navigate their digital world thoughtfully. Involving students in crafting flexible, meaningful phone policies reinforces this understanding, giving them a sense of agency in shaping technology’s role in their lives.</p>

<p>Computing educators are uniquely positioned to empower students, not just as users, but as active challengers of technology design norms. Embracing a collaborative approach allows computing educators to inspire students to envision a future where technology genuinely serves their growth and their learning, rather than commercial interests.</p>

<p>Lack of access to devices presents teachers with challenges in any setting. In schools, money is often limited and digital technology may not be the priority when buildings need maintenance or libraries need replenishing. This issue is particularly important when the very subject you teach relies on and relates to devices that you may have limited or no access to.</p>

<p>It must be frustrating for teachers in this situation to see marketing campaigns from companies showing how their curriculum offering will use the very latest in robotics, AI, or media production, when the teachers&#8217; reality is that they don’t have anything like the means or resources to deliver this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately there are approaches that can help. Below I outline some of the ways we are working with teachers to make the teaching of computing and digital literacy less resource-heavy and more accessible and equitable.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Schools in Kenya: A case study&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Our work with Kenyan teachers has brought the access issue into sharp focus for us. We are currently developing free resources to deliver the Kenyan curriculum to schools in Mombasa and the Frontier Counties. There are big contrasts both between and within these two areas of the country. Some schools are well equipped with digital technology, while others have very little access to any computing devices; in these schools, smartphones play a crucial role.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="667" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976.jpg" alt="Students code in Scratch on a computer." class="wp-image-90231" style="width:762px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9976-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>With that in mind, the curriculum resources we develop suggest class activities that make the most of limited devices, such as the use of projected demonstrations. We also provide a step-by-step guide to computing tasks, with screenshots, to guide learners through the tasks conceptually. This ensures learners understand the process and can apply their new knowledge once they gain access to the necessary devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We make these resources available online and in downloadable documents. This means the resources can be taken offline and taught in places without stable internet connection. We are also careful to limit file sizes, to make downloads more accessible. Wherever possible, our resources are device-agnostic, so that they can be accessed on a wide range of devices, including personal devices such as mobile phones.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="668" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925.jpg" alt="A close-up shot shows a person's hand holding a small red LED light, which is illuminated. " class="wp-image-90232" style="width:762px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925-450x301.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07925-900x601.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>As well as tailoring curriculum resources, we have also adapted our teacher training to make it more accessible for people with less experience of using computing devices. For example, during a recent project coaching community trainers in Mombasa, we emphasised activities that improve digital skills on various devices. This meant that when passing the training on to other teachers, the community trainers had a broader set of skills across a wider range of devices.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Unplugged activities</h2>



<p>Even computing-specific concepts such as a programming construct can, to a degree, be taught with very limited access to devices. Unplugged activities, where no digital technology is required, can be used to introduce fundamental concepts such as sequencing and repetition.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="668" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755.jpg" alt="A group of men holding a string." class="wp-image-90234" style="width:762px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755-450x301.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-20221025_Kenya_Connect_RPF_Training_07755-900x601.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>For example, you can ask learners to recognise patterns in repeating sequences of colours and identify how to describe the sequences without repeating the colours many times. While it is good practice to link the learning from an unplugged activity back to a plugged activity, students will still benefit when that is not possible.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Emulators&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are also a significant number of devices which offer online emulator apps that mirror the functions of the physical device. Consider <a href="https://www.tts-group.co.uk/bee-bot-programmable-floor-robot/1015268.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bee-Bot floor robots</a>, which can be relatively expensive to purchase and may get damaged in a classroom. If you don&#8217;t have the physical device, its <a href="http://helloworld.cc/beebot-emulator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emulator app</a> provides a similar experience.</p>

<p>Similarly, the <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/collections/microbit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">micro:bit</a>, a versatile microcontroller for young people, can be emulated in the MakeCode programming environment, including all its buttons and sensors. There are also numerous emulators which enable you to make and test your own circuits using a variety of hardware platforms. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What do you actually need?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Sometimes it can be helpful to look up what devices you actually need — they might not be as expensive as you think. General-purpose, single-board computers such as <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raspberry Pi</a> can be bought new for less than £25, and more powerful models still under £50.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="772" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b.jpg" alt="A young learner is building his project at a Coolest Projects event." class="wp-image-90236" style="width:762px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b.jpg 1024w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b-500x377.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b-768x579.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b-800x603.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b-450x339.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/46444116075_1e50b044f3_b-900x679.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p>Similarly, microcontrollers such as <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raspberry Pi Pico</a>, <a href="https://microbit.org/buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">micro:bit</a>, or <a href="https://redfernelectronics.co.uk/crumble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Crumble</a>, range from about £5 to £20 per device. Accessories such as LEDs, jumper leads, motors, and buzzers are also reasonably priced. They can be a relatively low-cost entry into physical computing and robotics, especially if you pair them with craft materials or share devices between students.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Make the most of it&nbsp;</h2>



<p>However limited your access to devices is, I encourage you to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Look out for partners or solution providers that prioritise inclusivity and accessibility in their resources</li>



<li>Consider whether you can make activities accessible on a wider range of devices and use what students may already have (check out <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/octostudio-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the OctoStudio app</a> for smartphones for example)</li>



<li>Use unplugged activities, and relate them back to plugged devices when possible</li>



<li>Look up devices which might be more affordable than you realised</li>
</ul>

<p>In this blog post, we will share more about the safety features of Experience CS, and the steps we’ve taken to make the platform a great fit for your school.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A safe, teacher-managed environment</h2>



<p>Experience CS supports young people to develop their understanding of computer science through engaging, interactive projects using the programming language Scratch. Scratch is a popular block-based language that helps young people get started with coding, and Experience CS includes a version of Scratch that we have built especially for schools. With our version, which is fully integrated into the Experience CS platform, students can explore coding in a teacher-managed, closed environment that aligns with schools’ safeguarding policies and gives you full control over what your students see and do.</p>

<p>Student safety and privacy are at the forefront in Experience CS, which means:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A private, closed environment</strong>. Projects are kept within the classroom and cannot be published to a public gallery.<br></li>



<li><strong>Teacher-controlled access</strong>. Students don’t need to create or manage their own accounts. Teachers manage their students’ access, with no student email addresses required.<br></li>



<li><strong>No social features</strong>. Students don’t create public profiles or follow other users, and there are no chat or comment features for young people.<br></li>



<li><strong>Curated content</strong>. Students can only access the projects and materials you share with them, not content from other users.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tailor-made for schools</h2>



<p>We have designed every part of the Experience CS platform with school environments in mind, making it easier for teachers to manage and for students to use.</p>



<p>Here’s how:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Fully integrated platform.</strong> Everything students need is built into the Experience CS platform, including Scratch, lesson resources, student materials, and project templates. There is no need to visit other websites.<br></li>



<li><strong>Simple access. </strong>Teachers generate class codes so learners can jump straight into activities, with no student email address required.<br></li>



<li><strong>Automatic progress saving.</strong> Students’ projects are saved in the platform and linked to their class. Teachers can see students’ progress at a glance.<br></li>



<li><strong>Teacher control.</strong> Teachers have full visibility of students’ activity, and what students see and do stays within the classroom environment.</li>
</ul>



<p>Experience CS gives you the tools and peace of mind to deliver creative, engaging computer science lessons and activities in a way that works for your school. You will be able to effortlessly manage students’ work, with everything you and your students need provided within a simple, intuitive interface.</p>
