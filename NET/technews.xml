<p>Creating a computer program involves many different skills — knowing how to code is just one part. When we teach programming to young people, we want to guide them to learn these skills in a structured way. The &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework is a great tool for doing that. This blog describes how using the framework will benefit you and your learners in the computing classroom.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning to program: Everything at once?</h2>



<p>Creating a program from the ground up can be daunting, especially for new learners. Without support, they’ll likely get stuck sooner or later; programs rarely work the first time round. And the more complex the problem that a program is addressing, the more likely it is that the first version of the program won’t work.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1728" height="1152" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8.jpg" alt="In a computing classroom, two girls concentrate on their programming task." class="wp-image-78793" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8.jpg 1728w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1728px) 100vw, 1728px" /></figure></div>


<p>One reason that learning to program can be challenging is that it involves understanding a lot of specific concepts and applying many varied skills. From early on in their learning journey, young people need to have a firm grasp of concepts such as repetition, selection, variables, and functions. Also fundamental to learning to program well is the skill of abstraction: understanding a task and identifying which details are relevant and which can be ignored.</p>



<p>To get to grips with all these different concepts and skills, young people need structure — otherwise they’ll try to hold everything in their head at once, and likely feel overwhelmed by the <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive load</a>. This sort of experience may cause them to disengage instead of persisting. They may even decide that programming is not for them.</p>



<p>In light of these challenges, the &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework is a great tool for teaching.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The benefits of the &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework</h2>



<p>The framework breaks programming down into four levels, each focusing on a different aspect of creating a program:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Problem: Analysing the problem or task the program should address, to understand and record the requirements.</li>



<li>Design: Turning the analysis into an algorithm — a set of steps for the computer to follow to create the desired output. This can involve flowcharts or storyboards, but importantly no code.</li>



<li>Code: Developing the code based on the design (and building the physical components if any are involved).</li>



<li>Running the code: Testing the code, checking outputs, and debugging where necessary.</li>
</ul>



<p>Throughout the processes of developing a program, learners (and professional programmers) move between these levels as they implement their designs and debug them, sometimes even returning to the problem level if more analysis or clarification is needed.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/BARROWHILL_CC4422CV031319-4.jpg" alt="Young child in the classroom using Scratch to program." class="wp-image-90539" style="width:720px"/></figure></div>


<p>Potential benefits of the &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework for teachers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It helps you break down the activity of programming into discrete parts.</li>



<li>It helps you engage your learners, as you can show them that programming involves more than knowing how to code.</li>



<li>If your learners get stuck with their programming, the framework can help you guide them to a solution.</li>
</ul>



<p>Potential benefits for learners:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The framework will help them think through all the steps needed to create a program that works, and practise their problem-solving skills and analytical thinking.</li>



<li>They will more readily see how programming connects to their world — at the problem level — and find aspects of programming where they have strengths and can use their creativity.</li>



<li>They will gain a stronger idea of how software is built in the tech sector.</li>
</ul>



<p>Our new Quick Read shares tips on how to best use the framework in your teaching.</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">

</div>



<p>Things to aim for when using the framework with your learners:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Be aware of what level they are working at and when it&#8217;s time to switch to a different one.</li>



<li>Understand that, when they encounter an issue with their program, they can step back and use the framework to figure out where the issue comes from. The issue might be a bug in the code, the algorithm not working as intended, or a description of the problem not taking into account something important.</li>
</ul>



<p>We hope you find the framework useful. If you have ideas for how to use it in your teaching, why not share them in the comments?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Teaching programming: The wider context</h2>



<p>When following the ‘levels of abstraction’ approach, learners need to explain how programs work and debug them. That means program comprehension is a key skill here. You may have already helped your learners to develop and practise this skill, for example with <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the PRIMM approach</a>. <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Block Model</a> is another useful tool for helping your learners talk about various aspects of a program. And if you use the <a href="http://the-cc.io/qr03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pair programming approach</a> in programming activities, your learners can improve their program comprehension by talking about their code with each other. On our website, you&#8217;ll find <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/pedagogy/resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more guidance on the best ways to teach programming and computing</a>.</p>

<p>And what about generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools for programmers? In the age of AI, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-kids-still-need-to-learn-to-code-in-the-age-of-ai/">we think young people still need to learn to code</a> because it empowers them to navigate and think critically about all digital technologies, including AI. And while generative AI tools can help a skilled programmer create quality code more quickly, more research is needed to show whether such tools help school-age young people build their understanding as they learn to code. You can see some of the great work being done in this area if you <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research/seminars/previous/programming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">catch up with our 2024 research seminar series</a>.</p>



<p>The &#8216;levels of abstraction&#8217; framework is useful in your teaching no matter what tools young people use to create programs. Even with an AI tool, they will still need to work at all four levels of abstraction to program effectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>This blog post is written by Victor Murithi, Communications and Media Consultant at Young Scientists Kenya, one of our global partners for Experience AI in Kenya.</em></p>



<p>When over 100 teachers from across Kenya gathered at Kangaru High School in Embu County for the Kenya Science and Engineering Fair Nationals in April, few anticipated just how transformative a two-day workshop could be. Delivered by the Experience AI Young Scientists Kenya (YSK) team, with support from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, the training sparked more than curiosity — it sparked a shift in mindset.</p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t just about introducing new tools: it was about empowering teachers to confidently lead their students into an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven future.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1066" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image.jpeg" alt="Students in a classroom learn about Experience AI." class="wp-image-90526" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image.jpeg 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-500x333.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-900x600.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>National reach and local impact</strong></h2>



<p>What began as a plan to train just 40 teachers quickly grew into something much bigger. By the time the workshop kicked off, 104 teachers from over 80 schools across 37 counties in Kenya, had registered and participated — nearly tripling the initial target.</p>



<p>This overwhelming interest confirmed a powerful insight: teachers are eager to understand AI, not only to better prepare their students for the future, but also for their own professional growth.</p>



<p>The workshop’s curriculum didn’t just focus on technical skills, it aimed to create confidence, clarity, and community among the attendees — key ingredients for successfully integrating AI into teaching and learning.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Helping teachers move past their fear of AI and understand its potential is incredibly powerful. Because AI is the future, and through this training, we’re reaching the minds that will shape it,” explained Lucy Mwaniki, AI Community Trainer at YSK.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical skills, real outcomes</strong></h2>



<p>As part of the training, the attendees completed interactive worksheets, tested basic machine learning models, and sat a final comprehension test, something they found both validating and motivational.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We were able to do the summative test… which turned out to be a very effective way of us understanding how in-depth and how well they grasped the knowledge,” says Lucy Mwaniki<em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>In one standout session, teachers collaboratively brainstormed ways AI could address national educational challenges. Ideas included models to assist students in selecting academic pathways within Kenya’s Competency Based Curriculum (CBC). Several teachers also successfully built working models, demonstrating the potential of applied learning.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It was a very eye-opening session… some of the teachers were able to create a very basic model, which was a wonderful experience for them,” Lucy Mwaniki<strong> </strong>explains.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>What made this training exceptional was its immediate applicability and long-term vision. By the end of two days, teachers weren&#8217;t just AI-aware — they were AI-ready, with many already starting to explore how AI tools could support entrepreneurship, lesson planning, and personalised learning pathways.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1496" height="1496" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1.jpeg" alt="Students in a classroom setting; two of them are using a laptop to learn about AI." class="wp-image-90527" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1.jpeg 1496w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-250x250.jpeg 250w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-500x500.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-800x800.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-100x100.jpeg 100w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-450x450.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-1-900x900.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1496px) 100vw, 1496px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Celebrating our achievements and impact&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>At the close of the training, each teacher received a Certificate of Participation, recognising their commitment to professional development and their new capacity to bring AI into the classroom. The awarding of certificates added a sense of accomplishment and pride, reinforcing that teachers are key drivers of technological transformation in education.</p>



<p>And the impact of the training was measurable:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>95% of teachers agreed that the training increased their knowledge and confidence to teach AI concepts</strong></li>



<li><strong>88% of teachers agreed that the training was high quality and useful for preparing them to teach the Experience AI lessons</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>But it doesn’t end there, as Vanessa Inziani, Head of Programs at YSK, explains, “Our commitment doesn’t end with the training — we continue to support educators with resources, mentorship, and follow-up to ensure success in delivering the program in the classroom.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking ahead towards a promising AI journey</strong></h2>



<p>With the rapidly evolving digital landscape, AI is no longer a distant concept — it’s a present-day classroom necessity. Yet, introducing AI into schools isn’t just about technical literacy; it’s about confidence, clarity, and community and the approach the Young Scientist Kenya team and Experience AI delivered during the two-day training is anchored in this belief.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As AI continues to shape the global education landscape, programs like Experience AI provide the bridge needed to equip teachers, inspire students, and future-proof education systems. The Kangaru High School session was not a one-off — it was a catalyst for systemic change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experience AI is scaling. As it expands across Kenya and beyond, the benefits are clear:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Empowered educators</strong> who gain confidence and skills to integrate AI in their teaching</li>



<li><strong>Future-ready students</strong> who grasp foundational AI concepts and their real-world applications</li>



<li><strong>Sustainable impact</strong> as trained teachers go on to influence thousands of learners in their communities</li>
</ul>



<p>The journey from fear to fluency starts with a single step, a willingness for us all to explore what’s possible. Together, we can equip educators, inspire students, and shape Kenya’s future, one AI-literate classroom at a time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>About Experience AI</em></strong></h2>



<p><em>Experience AI is an AI literacy programme, co-developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and Google DeepMind, that teaches students aged 11 to 14 about AI and machine learning.

<p>In our April research seminar, David Weintrop, Rotem Israel-Fishelson, and Peter Moon from the University of Maryland introduced <a href="https://apicancode.umd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">API Can Code</a>, a data science curriculum designed with high school students for high school students. Their talk explored how their innovative work uses real-world data and students&#8217; own experiences and interests to create meaningful, authentic learning experiences in data science.</p>



<p><strong><em>Quick note for educators</em></strong>: Are you interested in joining our free, exploratory data science education workshop for teachers on 10 July 2025 in Cambridge, UK? Then <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/join-our-free-data-science-education-workshop-for-teachers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find out the details here</a>.</p>



<p>David started by explaining the motivation behind the API Can Code project. The team’s goal was not to turn students into future data scientists, but to offer students the data literacy they need to explore and critically engage with a data-driven world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The work was also guided by a shared view among leading teachers’ organisations that data science should be taught across all subjects in the K–12 curriculum. It also draws on strong research showing that when educational experiences connect with students’ own lives and interests, it leads to deeper engagement and better learning outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reviewing the landscape</strong></h2>



<p>To prepare for the design of the curriculum, David, Rotem, and Peter wanted to understand what data science education options already exist for K–12 students. Rotem described how they compared four major K–12 data science curricula and examined different aspects, such as the topics they covered and the datasets they used. Their findings showed that many datasets were quite small in size, and that the datasets used were not always about topics that students were interested in.</p>

<p>The team also looked at 30 data science tools used across different K–12 platforms and analysed what each could do. They found that tools varied in how effective they were and that many lacked accessibility features to support students with diverse learning needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This analysis helped to refine the team&#8217;s objective: to create a data science curriculum that students find interesting and that is informed by their values and voices.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Participatory design</strong></h2>



<p>To work towards this goal, the team used a methodology called participatory design<em>. </em>This is an approach that actively involves the end users — in this case, high school students — in the design process. During several in-person sessions with 28 students aged 15 to 18 years old, the researchers facilitated low-tech, hands-on activities exploring the students’ identities and interests and how they think about data.</p>



<p>One activity, Empathy Map, involved students working together to create a persona representing a student in their school. They were asked to describe the persona’s daily life, interests, and concerns about technology and data:</p>

<p>The students’ involvement in the design process gave the team a better understanding of young people’s views and interests, which helped create the design of the API Can Code curriculum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>API Can Code: three units, three key tools</strong></h2>



<p>Peter provided an overview of the API Can Code curriculum. It follows a three-unit flow covering different concepts and tools in each unit:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Unit 1</strong> introduces students to different types of data and data science terminology. The unit explores the role of data in the students’ daily lives, how use and misuse of data can affect them, different ways of collecting and presenting data, and how to evaluate databases for aspects such as size, recency, and trustworthiness. It also introduces them to <a href="https://rapidapi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>RapidAPI</em></strong></a>, a hub that connects to a wide range of APIs from different providers, allowing students to access real-world data such as Zillow housing prices or Spotify music data.</li>



<li><strong>Unit 2 </strong>covers the computing skills used in data science, including the use of programming tools to run efficient data science techniques. Students learn to use <a href="https://edublocks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>EduBlocks</em></strong></a><strong>, </strong>a block-based programming environment where students can draw in JSON files from RapidAPI datasets, and process and filter data without needing a lot of text-based programming skills. The students also compare this approach with manual data processing, which they discover is very slow.</li>



<li><strong>Unit 3 </strong>focuses on data analysis, visualisation, and interpretation. Students use <a href="https://codap.concord.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>CODAP</em></strong></a>, a web-based interactive data science tool, to calculate summary statistics, create graphs, and perform analyses. CODAP is a user-friendly but powerful platform, making it perfect for students to analyse and visualise their data sets. Students also practise interpreting pre-made graphs and the graphs and statistics that they are creating.</li>
</ol>



<p>Peter described an example activity carried out by the students, showing how these three units flow together and build both technical skills and an understanding of the real-world uses of data science. Students were tasked with analysing a dataset from Zillow, a property website, to explore the question “How much does a house in my neighbourhood cost?” The images below show the process the students followed, which uses the data science skills and tools from all three units of the curriculum.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Interest-driven learning in action</strong></h2>



<p>A central tenet of API Can Code is that students should explore data that matters to them. A diverse range of student interests was identified during the design work, and the curriculum uses these areas of interest, such as music, movies, sports, and animals, throughout the lessons.</p>



<p>The curriculum also features an open-ended final project, where students can choose a research question that is important to them and their lives, and answer it using data science skills.</p>



<p>The team shared two examples of memorable final projects. In one, a student set out to answer the question “Is Jhené Aiko a star?” The student found a publicly available dataset through an API provided by Deezer, a music streaming platform. She wrote a program that retrieved data on the artist’s longevity and collaborations, analysed the data, and concluded that Aiko is indeed a star. What stood out about this project wasn’t just the fact that the student independently defined stardom and answered their research question using real data, but that this was a truly personal, interest-driven project. David noted that the researchers could never have come up with this activity, since they had never previously heard of Jhené Aiko!</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="1060" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9.png" alt="Jhené Aiko, an R&amp;B singer-songwriter" class="wp-image-90480" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9.png 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-300x199.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-500x331.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-768x509.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-1536x1018.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-800x530.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-450x298.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/image-9-900x596.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Jhené Aiko, an R&amp;B singer-songwriter&nbsp;</em><br><em>(Photo by Charito Yap, licensed under </em><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>CC BY-ND 2.0</em></a><em>)</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Another student’s project analysed data about housing in Washington DC to answer the question “Which ward in DC has the most affordable houses?” Rotem explained that this student was motivated by her family thinking about moving away from the city. She wanted to use her project to persuade her parents to stay by identifying the most affordable ward in DC that they could move to. She was excited by the outcome of her project, and she presented her findings to other students and her parents.</p>



<p>These projects underscore the power of personally important data science projects driven by students’ interests. When students care about the questions they are exploring, they&#8217;re more invested in the process and more likely to keep using the skills and concepts they learn.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resources</strong></h2>



<p>API Can Code is available online and completely free to use. Teachers can access lesson plans, tutorial videos, assessment rubrics, and more from the curriculum’s website <a href="https://apicancode.umd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://apicancode.umd.edu/</a>.

<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to celebrate yet another incredible year of young people reaching for the stars, as the European Astro Pi Challenge 2024/25 draws to a close. Teams from across Europe and ESA Member States are now receiving their well-deserved certificates and data from the International Space Station (ISS). It&#8217;s been a truly inspiring year, showcasing the phenomenal talent and dedication of young coders and scientists.</p>

<p>The European Astro Pi Challenge is an ESA Education project run in collaboration with us here at the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It offers young people the amazing opportunity to conduct scientific investigations in space by writing computer programs that run on Raspberry Pi computers on board the ISS, called Astro Pis.</p>



<p>There‘s a lot to celebrate from this year’s Astro Pi, so let’s take a look at some of the highlights for each of our inspiring Missions: Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1080" height="1080" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25.png" alt="A selection of images taken by Mission Space Lab teams" class="wp-image-90443" style="width:600px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25.png 1080w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-250x250.png 250w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-500x500.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-150x150.png 150w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-768x768.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-800x800.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-100x100.png 100w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-300x300.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-450x450.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/MSL-team-photos-24-25-900x900.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Figure 1: A selection of images taken by Mission Space Lab teams</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mission Zero: Inspiring coding, creativity, and inclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Mission Zero reached more young people than ever before in 2024/25, with 25,405 young people participating in 17,285 teams. After passing the rigorous testing and moderation processes, an amazing 17,109 teams (25,210 young people) were successful in getting their programs to run on the ISS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the great things about Mission Zero is that we see a good gender balance in participation. This year, 44% of participants identified as “female” and 4% as “prefer to self-describe”, “prefer not to say”, or “other”. This means that Mission Zero has achieved a more balanced gender representation than is typically seen in computing subjects, where the ratio is around 20:80 girls to boys.</p>

<div style="height:40px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mission Space Lab: More teams have their programs run in space</strong></h2>



<p>Mission Space Lab gives young people the opportunity to calculate the speed of the ISS in orbit using sensor and camera data collected from the Astro Pis on board the ISS. This year, 1859 young people in 552 teams participated in Mission Space Lab. Notably, 309 Mission Space Lab teams, or 95% of submissions, ran their programs on the ISS and are now analysing the data they collected. That’s 73 more teams achieving flight status than in 2023/24, and a total of 1084 young people receiving unique data sets from space and certificates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Running a program in space is very different from testing it on the ground. It’s always interesting to see how well your program has performed and how accurate the final output is. Below, you can see a scatter graph of the team estimates produced by their programs. The actual speed of the ISS is no secret: it’s travelling about 7.67 kilometres per second. How have teams performed with the ISS speed task?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inspiring and impactful</strong></h2>



<p>Another highlight from this year has been seeing how impactful participation can be for young people and mentors facilitating the activity. We receive lots of valuable feedback from the Astro Pi community each year, and it’s always heartwarming to hear what your experience has been and how we can improve the challenge. Here are a couple of quotes from the community who took part this year:</p>



<p>Mission Zero mentor: <em>“Having their programs run in space really motivated them to take part because it was an exciting reward and something they wanted to talk about with their friends.”</em></p>



<p>Parent of a Mission Zero participant: <em>“I was completely inexperienced in Python, but easily managed to help my 7-year-old.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More Code Clubs participating in 2024/25</strong></h2>



<p>It has been great to see lots of Code Clubs taking part in Astro Pi this year, both for Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab. This year, 986 young people from 700 teams did Mission Zero at their Code Club: that’s double the number from 2023/24. Plus, 43 Mission Space Lab teams from Code Clubs took part. That’s 143 young people, or almost double the number compared to the year before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We ran two code-alongs for the Code Club community this year, and it is encouraging to see increases for both missions. We will continue to support young people from all settings who want to take part in Astro Pi next year, whether it’s at school, Code Club, or other venues.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>In summary, it’s been a great year for Astro Pi. We’ve reached lots of young people through the challenge, met many inspiring mentors, and seen some really positive trends. Plus, all the operations on the space station that make Astro Pi possible went smoothly: when you are running programs in space, that isn’t always the case!&nbsp;</p>



<p>None of it would have been possible without the tireless efforts of the teachers, mentors, and educators who help run Astro Pi in your communities. From everyone here at Mission Control, thank you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’d like to tell us how we can provide more support to help you run Astro Pi, please email <a href="mailto:contact@astro-pi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contact@astro-pi.org</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll be back for more stellar space adventures in coding in September 2025.</p>

<p>Code Club is a global movement of free coding clubs where school-aged young people — called creators — develop the confidence to create with digital technologies. Code Clubs take place in schools and community venues like youth clubs, libraries, and maker spaces and are run by teachers, educators, and volunteers from all walks of life — known as mentors. These incredible mentors make Code Clubs possible and we are so grateful for their hard work.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>About the 2025 survey report</strong></h2>



<p>This Code Club annual survey report presents key responses from 775 mentors gathered via surveys and feedback from partners.</p>



<p>This year, <strong>7,494</strong> Code Clubs have confirmed they have been active in the last two years, with clubs in 102 countries. We estimate 257,000 creators are involved in clubs and 43% of creators are female. As one UK Code Club mentor put it: &#8220;Girls who didn&#8217;t think it was for them now have confidence&#8221;.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Code Clubs have a positive impact on young creators</strong></h2>



<p>In 2024, an <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/how-fun-filled-code-clubs-drive-learning-new-evidence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">independent evaluation</a> by the Durham University Evidence Centre for Education provided evidence of positive outcomes for young people attending Code Clubs. We are continuing to build on this evidence, with 96% of mentors responding to our surveys agreeing that creators have increased skills in computing and digital making, as well as increased confidence to engage with technology as a result of attending a Code Club.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few of the examples mentors gave of the impact Code Club has on creators:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Confidence:</strong> &#8220;[Creators become] more confident using technology and making friends. Some really come out of their shell compared to when they started.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, UK&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Skill development:</strong> “They come into the club with no coding skills (some barely know how to use a computer) and leave as competent, literate, coders.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, Canada</li>



<li><strong>Enjoyment:</strong> &#8220;One of our core principles is that coding should be fun&#8230; we give them creative ways to expand on the task. They learn to push themselves a bit beyond a task, and look for more things.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, the Netherlands&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Social skills:</strong> &#8220;One great outcome has been the socialization that occurs. Kids in our club are definitely making friendships and improving their soft skills.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, USA&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Continued participation: </strong>&#8220;It has increased their passion for tech and how to create new things to solve problems.&#8221; – Code Club mentor, Ghana</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Increasing access to technology</strong></h2>



<p>Code Club also plays an important role in increasing access to technology for creators who would otherwise not have access. We work with partners across the world to run clubs in areas of educational disadvantage to ensure that Code Clubs are available to creators from all backgrounds to address this need.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>In some regions, Code Club provides creators with their first significant encounter with digital making. A mentor <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/global-impact-empowering-young-people-in-kenya-and-south-africa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in Kenya</a> told us that Code Club ensured that creators in his area were not “left behind”.

<p>Today we&#8217;re publishing a position paper setting out five arguments for why we think that kids still need to learn to code in the age of artificial intelligence.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="333" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-500x333.png" alt="A whimsical cartoon of someone struggling with vibe coding at a desktop computer and a second person with a superhero cape and a t-shirt saying 'programmer' coming to their rescue." class="wp-image-90359" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-500x333.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-300x200.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-768x512.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-800x533.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-450x300.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode-900x600.png 900w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/06/whykidsstillneedtolearntocode.png 983w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Generated using ChatGPT.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Just like every wave of technological innovation that has come before, the advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are raising profound questions about the future of human work. History teaches us that technology has the potential to both automate and augment human effort, destroying some jobs and creating new ones. The only thing we know for sure is that it is impossible to predict the precise nature and pace of the changes that are coming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the fastest-moving applications of generative AI technologies are the systems that can generate code. What started as the coding equivalent of autocomplete has quickly progressed to tools that can generate increasingly complex code from natural language prompts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has given birth to the notion of &#8220;vibe-coding&#8221; and led some commentators to predict the end of the software development industry as we know it. It shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise then that there is a vigorous debate about whether kids still need to learn to code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the position paper we put forward five arguments for why we think the answer is an unequivocal yes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/about/Why-kids-still-need-to-learn-to-code-in-the-age-of-AI-2025-Raspberry-Pi-Foundation-position-paper.pdf">Download the paper</a></div>
</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">We need humans who are skilled programmers&nbsp;</h2>



<p>First, we argue that even in a world where AI can generate code, we need skilled human programmers who can think critically, solve problems, and make ethical decisions. The large language models that underpin these tools are probabilistic systems designed to provide statistically acceptable outputs and, as any skilled software engineer will tell you, simply writing more code faster isn&#8217;t necessarily a good thing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning to code is an essential part of learning to program</h2>



<p>Learning to code is the most effective way we know for a young person to develop the mental models and fluency to become a skilled human programmer. The hard cognitive work of reading, modifying, writing, explaining, and testing code is precisely how young people develop a deep understanding of programming and computational thinking.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning to code will open up even more opportunities in the age of AI&nbsp;</h2>



<p>While there&#8217;s no doubt that AI is going to reshape the labour market, the evidence from history suggests that it will increase the reach of programming and computational approaches across the economy and into new domains, creating demand for humans who are skilled programmers. We also argue that coding is no longer just for software engineers, it&#8217;s becoming a core skill that enables people to work effectively and think critically in a world shaped by intelligent machines. From healthcare to agriculture, we are already seeing demand for people who can combine programming with domain-specific skills and craft knowledge.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Coding is a literacy that helps young people have agency in a digital world</h2>



<p>Alongside the arguments for coding as a route to opening up economic opportunities, we argue that coding and programming gives young people a way to express themselves, to learn, and to make sense of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And perhaps most importantly, that learning to code is about power. Providing young people with a solid grounding in computational literacy, developed through coding, helps ensure that they have agency. Without it, they risk being manipulated by systems they don&#8217;t understand. As Rushkoff said: &#8220;Program, or be programmed&#8221;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The kids who learn to code will shape the future</h2>



<p>Finally, we argue that the power to create with technology is already concentrated in too small and homogenous a group of people. We need to open up the opportunity to learn to code to all young people because it will help us mobilise the full potential of human talent, will lead to more inclusive and effective digital solutions to the big global challenges we face, and will help ensure that everyone can share in the societal and economic benefits of technological progress.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The work we need to do&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We end <a href="https://static.raspberrypi.org/files/about/Why-kids-still-need-to-learn-to-code-in-the-age-of-AI-2025-Raspberry-Pi-Foundation-position-paper.pdf">the paper</a> with a call to action for all of us working in education. We need to challenge the false narrative that AI is removing the need for kids to learn to code, and redouble our efforts to ensure that all young people are equipped to take advantage of the opportunities in a world where AI is ubiquitous.</p>

<p>Bradford was buzzing with excitement this May as over 170 young digital makers from across the UK gathered for Coolest Projects UK 2025 at the Life Centre to celebrate the amazing things young people create with technology. Run by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and hosted by BBC science presenter Greg Foot, the free, in-person event brought together budding creators, families, mentors, and even a few troops of Scouts for a fun-filled day.</p>



<p>From AI tools and advanced programming to Scratch games and hardware builds, the showcase featured an incredible range of projects from 113 Coolest Projects participants and 58 scouts. Every young person received thoughtful feedback from industry professionals, the chance to try hands-on coding challenges, and the thrill of sharing what they built with a welcoming crowd and other creators.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A day of discovery and digital making</h2>



<p>Coolest Projects UK 2025 wasn’t just about showcasing finished products; it celebrated every part of the creative journey. Many creators shared works-in-progress or prototypes, sparking conversations around design, problem-solving, and learning through code.</p>



<p>One of the day’s highlights was an interactive escape room designed just for the event, giving attendees a chance to flex their logical thinking and collaboration skills. And for 58 visiting Scouts, the day was a chance to earn their Digital Maker Badge and share their creations with the showcase participants.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A platform for everyone</strong></h2>



<p>Many of this year’s participants came from local Code Clubs, CoderDojos, and schools across the UK. Others had worked independently to bring their ideas to life. The event encouraged collaboration and connection, with creators exchanging feedback, learning from each other, and celebrating shared interests.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, young people from Bradford also had the chance to take part in hands-on workshops. Held at the National Science and Media Museum, they were guided on getting started with digital making and developing their own project ideas for the showcase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Featured projects</strong></h2>



<p>Here are a few of the projects that were showcased on the day. Each one demonstrates the power of digital tools and the fun and creativity that young people bring to their Coolest Projects journeys. Here’s what the creators had to say about their work, what inspired them, and their experiences of the day:</p>



<p><strong>Arlo | MUST. EAT. DONUTS., AI</strong></p>



<p>Arlo’s interactive game featured AI models that used face and mouth tracking to make the main character, called Chompy, mirror the movements of the player. Arlo&#8217;s game was inspired by a session at his Code Club. He came across a video sensing motion plug-in and realised he could make a game that used the player’s head as the controller.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It is a fun and silly game for all to play. I also created the artwork myself in my own style, as drawing is another one of my passions, alongside coding. I would love to come back next year, maybe in a different category. I wanted to enter because I got the chance to share my coding and drawing skills, and I was excited to think others may play a game I created.”</p>

<p><strong>Felicia and Francesca | The Silent Forest, Scratch</strong></p>



<p>Felicia and Francesca created a top-down, Zelda-style RPG in Scratch, where the player explores a pixel world and interacts with characters and objects. Instead of using the keyboard, the game is controlled with a Micro:bit. Felicia shared with us why they wanted to showcase the game at Coolest Projects.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I went to Coolest Projects UK because I love making things with Scratch and wanted to show my game to other people. It was a fun way to share what I built, see what other kids made, and learn new ideas. I wanted to challenge myself and be part of something really cool!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Eesa, Yahya and Yusha | Let&#8217;s Speak Arabic!, Scratch</strong></p>



<p>Let’s Speak Arabic is an interactive program designed to help people learn conversational Arabic. Eesa, Yahya, and Yusha are home educated and study a book called <em>Al Arabiyyah Bayna Yadayk</em> together. This inspired them to think about fun ways to upgrade their study, and the idea for gamifying their learning through Scratch was born. The team shared a little about their experience:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The event was awesome. Actually, it was even better than we imagined! We loved meeting people from all over the country, really enjoyed playing other people’s games, and got lots of ideas for what we could code in the future. And, our parents were so proud we got judge’s favourite!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Jay | J Bot, Hardware</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/celebrating-the-community-jay/">Jay is a long-time friend</a> of the Foundation and has been taking part in Coolest Projects online and in person for the past few years. He wowed again this year with his life-sized J Bot and shared with us why he thinks Coolest Projects is such an important event for the young creator community.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I know it might seem a bit intimidating to come and showcase in front of all these people, but I feel more and more people should try and get involved [in Coolest Projects] because it’s a really good community of people. And they are really supportive as well. So I would just say, give it a go. Don’t be nervous because people are here to help you along the way.”</p>

<p>From smart devices to workplace tools, AI is becoming part of everyday life and a major part of how people are thinking about the future — raising big questions about access, skills, and readiness.</p>



<p>As governments around the world create AI strategies for the decade ahead, many are seeing an urgent need to address the large gap between how AI tools are already <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1161826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impacting jobs</a> and people’s lives, and making sure young people have the chance to gain the skills and knowledge to keep up with this rapid pace of technological change. This gap is larger still when it comes to opportunities for educationally underserved communities.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-12.png" alt="A group of students and educators holding an Experience AI poster." class="wp-image-90282" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-12.png 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-12-300x225.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-12-500x375.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-12-768x576.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-12-800x600.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-12-450x338.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-12-900x675.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>That’s why we’re excited to share how <a href="http://rpf.io/expai-gp-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI</a>, our AI literacy programme, is helping organisations around the world create these much-needed opportunities for young people.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The value of a global network</strong></h2>



<p>Experience AI was co-developed in 2022 by us and industry experts at Google DeepMind with a clear mission: to equip teachers with free, accessible, easy-to-use classroom resources that build AI literacy from the ground up. The programme offers a suite of materials to help students understand real-world applications of AI, the basics of machine learning, and the ethical considerations around these technologies.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1479" height="1600" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6.jpeg" alt="A picture of Philip Colligan delivering a talk." class="wp-image-90283" style="width:580px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6.jpeg 1479w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-231x250.jpeg 231w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-500x541.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-768x831.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-1420x1536.jpeg 1420w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-800x865.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-450x487.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/05/image-6-900x974.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1479px) 100vw, 1479px" /></figure></div>


<p>In 2023, we <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-canada-kenya-romania/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started building an international Experience AI network</a> by collaborating with a group of our existing educational partners. We saw a huge amount of interest and received very positive feedback, and through our partnerships we reached an estimated one million young people. In late 2024, with support from <a href="http://google.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google.org</a>, we tripled the size of our <a href="http://rpf.io/expai-gppage-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experience AI partner network</a> to 21, with new organisations joining from across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In this way, we aim to reach an <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/experience-ai-expands-to-reach-over-2-million-students/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">additional 2.3 million young people by December 2026</a>, helping them to gain the knowledge and skills to confidently engage with AI in an ever-changing world.</p>



<p>Each partner in the Experience AI network is a unique educational organisation looking to create lasting social change. Through their local knowledge and networks, we can present Experience AI to educators and students in a way that is engaging and relevant for local communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Partners help us to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/localising-ai-education-adapting-experience-ai-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adapt and translate our resources</a>, all while making sure that the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/">core</a><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/explaining-ai-terms-young-people-educators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> pedagogy</a> and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-anthropomorphism/">design</a><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-were-taking-a-problem-first-approach-to-the-development-of-ai-systems/"> principles</a> of Experience AI are preserved. Just as importantly, these organisations <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/impact-of-experience-ai-in-kenya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">train thousands of teachers</a> on how to use the materials, providing educators with free support. With their work, they reach communities that otherwise may have never had the opportunity to learn about AI.</p>



<p>We asked some of our partners to share their insights on the impact Experience AI is having on the teachers and young people in their communities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building communities</strong></h2>



<p>The Latvian Safer Internet Centre (LSIC), an initiative of our partner, the <a href="https://www.lia.lv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Latvian Internet Association</a> (LIA), is dedicated to helping young people protect themselves online, and to preparing them for a fast-changing digital economy. As an Experience AI partner, they aim to train 850 teachers and support 43,000 students to build a strong foundation in AI literacy through the programme.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We hope to spark a cultural shift in how AI is […] taught in Latvian schools. Our goal is for AI literacy to become a natural part of digital competence education, not an optional extra.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based in Riga, the team is travelling to 18 different regions across Latvia to bring in-person professional development to teachers, including those in rural communities far from major cities. By meeting teachers where they are, the LIA are creating invaluable networks for learning and support between communities. Through hands-on training, they are also supporting teachers to bring Experience AI into their own classroom, creating examples which are suited for their learners.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We chose an in-person training model because it fosters a more collaborative and engaging environment, especially for teachers who are new to AI. Many educators, particularly those who are less confident with digital tools, benefit from direct interaction, real-time discussions, and the chance to ask questions in a supportive setting.” </p>
</blockquote>



<p>As an Experience AI partner, the Latvian Internet Association is not just delivering content but working to strengthen digital competency across the country and ensure that no teacher or student is left behind in Latvia’s AI journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One teacher shares: “The classroom training was truly valuable: it gave us the chance to exchange ideas and reflect on our diverse experiences. Hearing different perspectives was enriching, and I’m glad we’re shaping the future of our schools together.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>“AI is for everyone”</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.edcamp.ua/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EdCamp Ukraine</a>’s mission is to unite educators and help them to grow. Operating from their main base in Kharkiv, near the Eastern border and the frontline of the ongoing war in Ukraine, they see AI as both a tool for new technological breakthroughs and as something that can help build a fairer, more efficient, and resilient society.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We firmly believe AI should not only be an object of study — it must become a tool for amplifying human potential. AI should also not be a privilege, but a resource for everyone. We believe the Experience AI programme can truly transform education from the bottom up.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Within their community of 50,000 teachers, EdCamp Ukraine ensures that every educator, regardless of their living conditions or where they work, can access high-quality, relevant, and accessible support. For the organisation, the ongoing situation in Ukraine means being flexible with planning, preparing for a range of different outcomes, and being ready to pivot delivery to different locations or to an online setting when needed. These same considerations apply to EdCamp Ukraine&#8217;s teacher community, who need to be ready to adapt their lessons for any scenario.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Recognising these war-related challenges helps us see the bigger picture and always have contingency plans in place. We think ahead and develop flexible scenarios.”</p>

<p>This year, the team piloted Experience AI through their community of trainers, who, when they’re not training, are busy teaching in the classroom. Teacher Yuliia shared how her students valued the opportunity to be creators, rather than just users of technology:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“One student, who is an active AI user, kept silent during the lesson. I thought he wasn’t interested, but during the reflection he shared a lot of positive feedback and expressed his gratitude. Other students said it was important that they weren’t just told about AI — they were using it, creating images, and working with apps.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A turning tide</h2>



<p>2024 was the year the tide turned against smartphones. Across the world, parents, teachers, and governments highlighted the risks of excessive phone use among young people. In the UK, the ‘Smartphone Free Childhood’ movement emerged, quickly growing to 100,000 members who advocate for keeping smartphones away from children due to concerns about addiction, harmful content, and mental health. Jonathan Haidt’s global bestseller <em>The Anxious Generation</em> has further fuelled the movement, linking smartphone use to adolescent mental health issues and recommending phonefree schools. Meanwhile, countries including England, France, and Finland have urged schools to adopt strict phone bans, hoping to reduce classroom distractions and enhance student safety.</p>

<p>Despite widespread support, academic research on phone bans remains limited and inconclusive. Given this situation, computing educators are uniquely positioned to offer an alternative approach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Evaluating evidence on phone bans&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The rapid spread of school smartphone bans is a straightforward response to complex issues around personal technology use in education. Teachers and parents frequently view phones as inherently disruptive, a perspective supported by studies that show phones can impair students’ focus and engagement in lessons. Concerns about cyberbullying and addiction contribute to this view, with many educators seeing bans as a practical solution to mitigate risks. Surveys in England reveal that nearly half of all secondary schools now enforce all-day bans. This trend was supported by teachers participating in my master’s degree research, who see these policies as necessary to reduce distractions and maintain control in the classroom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;Calls for outright bans may oversimplify the conversation.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yet calls for outright bans may oversimplify the conversation, limiting opportunities to examine both the benefits and the risks of smartphone use in schools. <a href="http://helloworld.cc/smartphone-evidence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evidence on the impact of phone restrictions is mixed</a>: while some studies suggest restrictions may benefit learning, especially for students who struggle the most, others indicate no significant impact on academic outcomes. Additionally, recent findings show that cyberbullying is not directly linked to time spent online, with traditional bullying still more prevalent in schools. Even the narrative around smartphone addiction is contested, with some researchers suggesting that concerns about addiction may be overstated. And <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/teaching-digital-literacy-without-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some schools do not have access to digital devices</a> for learners and then smartphones may play a crucial role in teaching and learning digital literacy skills.</p>

<p>As the debate over smartphone bans continues, educators have an opportunity to move beyond restrictions and engage students in understanding the technology that shapes their lives. This is where computing educators can really make a difference. How can they guide students to understand why technology is designed to capture attention and what lies behind these design choices?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding and questioning the design of technology&nbsp;</h2>



<p>School smartphone bans can feel like a hopeless act that suggests phones and social media are inherently incompatible with learning and student well-being. This approach assumes the only solution is to remove them, rather than considering how these technologies might be better managed or reimagined to support young people. What if, instead of banning phones, educators worked with students to explore why they are so captivating and how they could be designed differently? Computing educators can lead this exploration. With digital literacy as part of their curriculum, computing teachers can help students question the motives behind their devices, fostering a critical understanding of the forces shaping their digital world.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>At the heart of how social media platforms are designed is their business models. Tech companies rely on features such as notifications, autoplay, and infinite scrolling to maximise user engagement and revenue. This is part of what the writer Shoshana Zuboff calls <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=56791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“surveillance capitalism”</a>, where companies gather vast amounts of behavioural data by keeping users engaged on their platforms for as long as possible.</p>



<p>In the classroom, educators can open discussions with students on the motives behind technology design, exploring questions such as why platforms want users to stay engaged, and what data they are collecting. Activities might include analysing popular apps to identify which features encourage prolonged use, or debating how social media could be designed to prioritise user wellbeing. By critically examining these design choices, students can better understand the forces driving their digital interactions and consider ways in which technology could be reimagined to serve them, rather than just profiting from them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Collaborative policymaking&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once young people understand why phones and social media are designed the way they are, educators can work with students to create phone policies that reflect shared values and goals. This collaborative approach encourages students to take ownership of their technology use, and computing teachers, drawing on their knowledge of technology design and digital literacy, are ideally positioned to facilitate these discussions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.renniecenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-01/2019%20Condition%20of%20Education%20Action%20Guide_Student%20Voice.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research suggests that policies developed with student input are more effective</a>, as they foster responsibility and engagement. By involving students in policymaking, educators can encourage them to consider how phones could support rather than hinder learning. For example, students might agree that phones should stay off during certain times, or in certain spaces, but that they might be useful in other scenarios where access benefits learning. This kind of flexibility ensures that phones are used thoughtfully, allowing for both practical boundaries and opportunities for educational use.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Critical skills for navigating the digital world</h2>



<p>As debate around smartphone use in schools continues, academic research remains inconclusive on the effectiveness of phone bans. This uncertainty presents computing educators with an opportunity to move beyond restrictive policies and foster deeper understanding. By guiding students to explore why phones and social media are designed to capture attention, we can help to equip them with the critical skills needed to navigate their digital world thoughtfully. Involving students in crafting flexible, meaningful phone policies reinforces this understanding, giving them a sense of agency in shaping technology’s role in their lives.</p>

<p>Computing educators are uniquely positioned to empower students, not just as users, but as active challengers of technology design norms. Embracing a collaborative approach allows computing educators to inspire students to envision a future where technology genuinely serves their growth and their learning, rather than commercial interests.</p>
