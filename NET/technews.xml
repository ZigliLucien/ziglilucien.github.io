										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Taking part in the European Astro Pi Challenge builds young people’s confidence and motivates them to try further digital making and programming activities, according to their mentors. The challenge, a European Space Agency (ESA) Education project run in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi Foundation, offers young people the amazing opportunity to write a short computer program to run on Raspberry Pi computers on board the International Space Station (ISS).</p>



<p>An incredible 27,304 young people from 27 countries got involved in Astro Pi 2024–25, with 26,294 succeeding in having their code run in space across the two challenge activities, Mission Zero and Mission Space Lab. As in past years, we’ve asked mentors and their teams about their experience and the impact participating had on them. So what did they say?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How we listened to feedback</h2>



<p>To find out what worked well, what we could improve, and the impact Astro Pi has had on young people&#8217;s lives this year, we encouraged mentors to complete a survey after teams submitted their computer programs. We also ran focus group discussions to deepen our understanding. A huge thank you to the 99 Mission Zero and 26 Mission Space Lab mentors who completed our surveys, and the five mentors who participated in our focus groups.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is working well</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Low stakes but high impact</h3>



<p>Mentors believe that Astro Pi is a great opportunity for young people to build their coding skills and knowledge of STEM concepts. Close to 80% of mentors for Mission Zero and 90% for Mission Space Lab agreed that these outcomes were being achieved for the young people in their teams. Mentors also appreciated that while the programme had real-world application, the learning experience was relaxed and low pressure.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1600" height="603" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-91324" style="width:720px" title="Chart" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4.png 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-300x113.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-500x188.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-768x289.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-1536x579.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-800x302.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-450x170.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-4-900x339.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></figure></div>


<p>Many of our young participants come from areas of educational disadvantage or traditionally underrepresented groups where confidence with technology and STEM subjects can be low. Mentors reported that the programme empowers young people, increasing their confidence with computing and digital making, and helping them connect with a wider community of learners from around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“They [young people] come from complicated environments and sometimes their confidence is very low. They don&#8217;t believe in themselves and this [Mission Zero challenge] really empowers them.” — Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;I think having a space mission, having Mission Zero is a way of connecting not only to a worldwide group of learners, but also explorers, future scientists, future astronauts. To see them as part of a larger community, not just an activity or assignment that they have to do in class. They discover their own abilities and potential, and exercise their creativity in a very low stakes environment… and then to see it come to life in that global way I think is extremely valuable.” — Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This increased confidence also encourages young people to take on other opportunities. 78% of Mission Zero mentors and 96% of Mission Space Lab mentors believe that it is likely that their students will participate in other coding and digital making challenges in the future.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Space is cool!</h3>



<p>The connection to space and the ISS continues to be a strong motivator, not just for young people but also mentors and other peers. In our survey, 90% of mentors in Mission Zero and 92% in Mission Space Lab reported that the young people participating were highly motivated by the possibility of having their code run on the ISS. In focus groups, mentors highlighted how the excitement of working on a space project extended to them and other adults too.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“They&#8217;ve always really enjoyed the sheer fact that you get to send stuff into space because it is really cool.” — Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“You know, even the adults I tell about this say, ‘oh, that sounds amazing. Can I do it?’ I go, ‘No, you&#8217;re too old. I&#8217;m too old.’” — Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;We want our code to run in space! We are fascinated by discovery and the opportunity to contribute to a real science experiment on the ISS.&#8221; — Mission Space Lab mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The resources and guidance are useful</h3>



<p>We know how crucial mentors are to the success of Astro Pi. Mentors come from diverse backgrounds and we are committed to making sure they feel prepared and supported. We were thrilled to hear that over 90% of Mission Zero mentors and 80% of Mission Space Lab mentors found the Astro Pi resources useful.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I had no skills but the support proved to be excellent” — Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Step-by-step instructions were excellent and really clear. Very easy to follow.” — Mission Zero mentor</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For Mission Space Lab, the more technical activity, we’ve been working on providing additional support. In 2024–25 we introduced a new online simulator tool for teams to test their programs with historical ISS data. Mentors found the tool to be helpful, allowing them to troubleshoot their code.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What could be improved?</h2>



<p>While we celebrate the successes, we’re always keen to understand how we can improve the programme.</p>



<p>As in previous years, mentors reported that young people whose computer programs passed the eligibility criteria and ran on the ISS (or “achieved flight status&#8221;, as we call it) benefited most from the experience. While 12% more Mission Space Lab teams achieved flight status this year compared to last year, some registered teams still did not submit programs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To understand why, we surveyed mentors who had registered but who did not then submit computer programs. In the 55 responses, the main reasons given were a shortage of time due to other school commitments, and their teams finding the challenge difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some survey respondents suggested a need for more simplified, step-by-step instructions for less experienced learners. Additionally, a few teams faced technical issues with the online portal and the testing tool.</p>



<p>Thank you to all the mentors who provided their honest feedback. We’ve read and considered all of it and will use it to make Astro Pi even better in the future.</p>



<p>Astro Pi will be launching for its 10th year on Monday, 8 September 2025. We’ve been working on making it easier than ever to take part in both missions and are looking forward to supporting you and your teams in getting your code into space.

<p>We love hearing from members of the community and sharing stories of amazing young people, volunteers, and educators who are using their passion for technology to create positive change in the world around them.</p>



<p>Today, we introduce Shajan, a digital storyteller and senior business advisor at the BBC, whose extraordinary personal and professional journey has led him to champion digital literacy for young people in Bangladesh.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="1600" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/CCBD-me-1.jpeg" alt="Shajan at a computer." class="wp-image-91298" style="width:520px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/CCBD-me-1.jpeg 1200w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/CCBD-me-1-188x250.jpeg 188w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/CCBD-me-1-500x667.jpeg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/CCBD-me-1-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/CCBD-me-1-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/CCBD-me-1-800x1067.jpeg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/CCBD-me-1-450x600.jpeg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/CCBD-me-1-900x1200.jpeg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Family roots in Bangladesh</strong></h2>



<p>Shajan is British-born, but his roots deeply connect him to Bangladesh. This connection was instilled by childhood holidays to Bangladesh, as well as his late father, who emigrated to the UK in the 1960s but always encouraged Shajan to maintain ties with the community he left behind. Shajan&#8217;s pull towards Bangladesh intensified after his father&#8217;s passing fifteen years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;I always thought I&#8217;d like to do something, carry on the work he left behind with efforts in building schools and supporting his local community.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The memory of his sister Khela, who passed away at just 12 years old while in Bangladesh, also motivates Shajan. He says, &#8220;She was a really creative person, really into her arts and crafts and learning.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Khela&#8217;s loss fuels Shajan&#8217;s desire to do something specifically for the young people of Bangladesh, connecting with their potential for creativity and learning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Setting off on a new path</strong></h2>



<p>Shajan&#8217;s 15 years of working for the BBC led him to discover the power of digital education. In 2015, he project-managed the BBC&#8217;s &#8220;Make It Digital&#8221; campaign, a UK-wide initiative addressing the National Digital Skills Gap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of this, he led partnerships with organisations like <a href="https://codeclub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Club</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“That experience showed me how digital tools could unlock creativity in young people and build their confidence.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>During his visits to Bangladesh, Shajan observed a widening digital divide. Young people, especially in rural areas, lacked access to basic internet and computers. Teachers faced heavy workloads, and many students needed to pause their education to support their families. Seeing no equivalent to Code Club in Bangladesh to inspire young people, Shajan felt he had to act. Before he knew it, he was requesting a six-month career break.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;This is what I always wanted to do. If I don&#8217;t do it now, I will miss the opportunity.'&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With the support of both the BBC and Code Club, Shajan packed his bags and moved to Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Creating a movement</strong></h2>



<p>Shajan&#8217;s initial goal was to raise awareness and build a sustainable model for Code Club in Bangladesh. Recognising that teachers needed support to run clubs, Shajan’s strategy was to engage university students as volunteers. He organised a national coding festival, leveraging these student volunteers to connect with schools and prepare young participants for a Scratch-based project challenge. The event received lots of media attention, encouraging interest and inspiring a new generation of coders.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/Code-Club-Bangladesh-National-Childrens-Coding-Festival-pic-1.jpg" alt="Students at Code Club Bangladesh." class="wp-image-91305" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/Code-Club-Bangladesh-National-Childrens-Coding-Festival-pic-1.jpg 2048w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/Code-Club-Bangladesh-National-Childrens-Coding-Festival-pic-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/Code-Club-Bangladesh-National-Childrens-Coding-Festival-pic-1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/Code-Club-Bangladesh-National-Childrens-Coding-Festival-pic-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/Code-Club-Bangladesh-National-Childrens-Coding-Festival-pic-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/Code-Club-Bangladesh-National-Childrens-Coding-Festival-pic-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/Code-Club-Bangladesh-National-Childrens-Coding-Festival-pic-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/Code-Club-Bangladesh-National-Childrens-Coding-Festival-pic-1-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></figure></div>


<p>However, there were some hurdles that had to be worked around, including unreliable internet connections, limited access to computers, and unstable electricity supply. Beyond practical challenges, Shajan faced a crucial mindset shift.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Not everybody&#8217;s convinced yet that their children should be doing coding. For many families, generating immediate income takes precedence over digital education. Balancing the need to put food on the table with the long-term benefits of coding remains a constant battle.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite these obstacles, Shajan&#8217;s efforts proved successful. Some of the creators from the 2016–2017 classes, now in their twenties, have pursued computer science and now share how Code Club helped them on their paths. He also organised an incredible exchange program, bringing creators and mentors from Code Club South Korea to Bangladesh for a seven-day visit. Despite not sharing a language, creators connected through the language of code, an experience Shajan describes as inspiring for the young people and adults alike.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new chapter</strong></h2>



<p>Shajan’s focus now is to launch a <a href="https://online.coolestprojects.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coolest Projects</a> event in Sylhet, the place his father was born and a region he wants to focus on before taking Coolest Projects national as well.</p>



<p>He is actively engaging with teachers and student volunteers across the city, with strong support from Nooraiya Khan, an ICT Lecturer with a background in computer science. Nooraiya is working hard with Shajan to co-lead all Code Club activities in Bangladesh, bringing valuable expertise and shared passion to the movement.</p>



<p>Shajan believes the current digital landscape offers new opportunities. He is a strong advocate for the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in education, viewing it as a way to help bring opportunities to all young people. He plans to introduce <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/technology/ai_and_data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-focused Code Club projects</a> to Bangladesh, ensuring the next generation is prepared for a future driven by technology.</p>



<p>For Shajan, Code Club Bangladesh is &#8220;for everybody&#8221;. He wants to ensure that no child, especially girls and those from underserved communities, is left behind. He would welcome anyone interested in helping the young people of Bangladesh, including teachers, educators, tech professionals, and government bodies, to join Code Club Bangladesh’s journey.</p>



<p>If you’d like to support young people in your community to explore coding, why not start a Code Club? The team will support you every step of the way with resources, training, and a collaborative community.</p>

<p>Throughout our lives, we’re constantly learning from others. Whether we’re interacting with teachers or trainers, or observing friends or strangers, we’re learning either deliberately or inadvertently. This process is known as ‘social learning’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In today’s blog, you&#8217;ll dive into what social learning is and how you can use it to create more engaging and effective learning experiences in your computing classroom.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll also find our latest <a href="https://the-cc.io/qr27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pedagogy Quick Read, which explores social learning</a>. It’s free to download and includes:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Practical tips for how to use social learning and related approaches with your learners</li>



<li>A summary of the research behind social learning</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is social learning?</strong></h2>



<p>Social learning is simply any learning that involves other people. It can take any form, from watching a video, to taking part in a classroom discussion. It can take place in person or online, and it can happen without people realising they’re learning something.</p>



<p>Social learning is based on modelling and involves people observing and imitating the behaviours that others model. Albert Bandura, the acknowledged originator of social learning theory, suggested that social learning is guided by four related processes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Attention: Recognising and focusing on someone’s behaviour and its vital elements</li>



<li>Retention: Creating a mental image and description to help you recall what you observed; practising responses (mentally or actively)</li>



<li>Reproduction: Translating the mental image back into actions</li>



<li>Motivation: Having a good reason to repeat (or avoid) the behaviours, depending on the rewards or punishments involved</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How can I enable social learning?</strong></h2>



<p>There’s lots of ways you can involve social learning in your computing classroom, including through other teaching approaches and frameworks.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-qw.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXddQBuLVR9P43LCtWyMpFQsUJK__lDxbEaWKlYnfMlxS7SPNSxQzw_37A5yoMqLYazKfKIDYCbgE-ODC-jvdUUzJRaGWvMLHB5HqBChxVu7jQFnd4bq0HyPQ5hKw9pqOxTDfXTMgA?key=1qFGVc53lQ3hqwvNuD6hiw" alt="4 children social learning in the classroom" style="width:652px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>To help your learners get the most out of social learning, it&#8217;s best to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Create a safe environment for learners to share learnings, ask questions, and actively engage in the learning process</li>



<li>Include a mix of resources and activities to ensure inclusion and accessibility</li>



<li>Set clear expectations and instructions, and ensure that social learning is key to achieve learning objectives</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Applying social learning: Some teaching approaches</strong></h3>



<p>Among our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/teach/pedagogy/resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pedagogy resources</a>, you&#8217;ll find lots of practical advice for teaching approaches that promote social learning. The approaches we recommend for the pedagogy principles &#8216;Work together&#8217; and &#8216;Model everything&#8217; are especially suitable.</p>



<p>Work together:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://the-cc.io/qr03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pair programming</a> (PDF)</li>



<li><a href="https://the-cc.io/qr04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peer instruction</a> (PDF)</li>



<li><a href="https://the-cc.io/qr15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project-based learning</a> (PDF)</li>



<li><a href="https://the-cc.io/qr16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physical computing</a> (PDF)</li>
</ul>



<p>Model everything:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://the-cc.io/qr02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worked examples</a> (PDF)</li>



<li><a href="https://the-cc.io/qr05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Live coding</a> (PDF)</li>



<li><a href="https://the-cc.io/qr24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Levels of abstraction in programming</a> (PDF)</li>



<li><a href="https://the-cc.io/qr14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code tracing</a> (PDF)</li>
</ul>



<p>Using a <a href="https://the-cc.io/qr11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PRIMM</a> (PDF) approach for structuring programming lessons, and encouraging students to talk about code as part of these, also works well for social learning.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Applying social learning: Practical examples</strong></h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at <a href="https://the-cc.io/qr03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>pair programming</strong></a> as an example. In this activity, pairs of learners work together to create a computer program, taking on distinct roles that they swap regularly. One learner acts as the &#8216;driver&#8217;, writing the code, while the other is the &#8216;navigator&#8217;, guiding the process, reviewing the code, and identifying potential issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As they work, each learner is able to observe the other person’s approach, learning with and from their partner throughout the activity. This constant interaction and shared problem solving can help them to understand programming concepts better and to build stronger teamwork skills.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-qw.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcQUJ_ygoMT3sPQEgUDhQ5JuciWnZFnDe70GykCegEG-HTjzWypO_Kw19RTtvpGdADPqmLNzJ7JsCXElnd8Bc9XsoE7gXn98Cup6uO4g-8I8fDemSrdhm_kN3dRjs5ZiQWOmNtWlA?key=1qFGVc53lQ3hqwvNuD6hiw" alt="Children in the classroom social learning" style="width:650px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>Another example is setting your class the task to <strong>create shared digital resources</strong> on several topics everyone needs to learn about. In this activity, you split learners into small groups or pairs, and assign them a topic to later explain to the whole group. Grouped learners work together to create a resource explaining their topic. As the facilitator, you can either provide the information they need, or let them conduct their own research. At the end of the activity, each group presents their resource to the wider class.</p>



<p>An activity like this helps learners develop their knowledge through working together and talking to each other, and also provides the class with resources they can keep using.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The benefits of social learning</strong></h2>



<p>Potential benefits for teachers:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Improved student engagement and learning</li>



<li>Enhanced professional development experiences, leading to more confident teaching</li>
</ul>



<p>Potential benefits for students:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Improved social skills</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Partnering up to increase our reach</strong></h2>



<p>Code Club is a thriving global community of clubs where young people can develop the confidence to create with digital technologies in a fun and supportive space. In Kenya we’ve been working closely with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/giving-back-through-code-club-meet-douglas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oasis Mathare</a>, Young Scientists Kenya, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/computing-education-machakos-kenya-edtech-hub-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenya Connect</a>, Tech Kidz Africa, STEAM Labs Africa, and Futures Infinite, while in South Africa we’ve teamed up with Keep a Child Alive and <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/highlights-from-coolest-projects-south-africa-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coder:Level Up</a>.</p>



<p>We used a train-the-trainer model to help our partners in Kenya and South Africa train Code Club mentors. We began by training community trainers from each partner, who then went on to deliver training to club mentors. This has allowed us to reach 1,498 mentors across both countries. Club mentors told us how grateful they have been to these partners for their ongoing support, including providing training and visiting the clubs.</p>



<p>As part of our ongoing evaluation of the Code Club programme in Kenya and South Africa, we’ve collected feedback from our partners, club mentors, and creators via feedback surveys, club visits, and focus groups to help us understand the impact of our work.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="668" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6622.jpg" alt="Douglas from Oasis Mathare (second from left) with members of the Raspberry Pi Foundation team." class="wp-image-91253" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6622.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6622-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6622-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6622-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6622-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6622-450x301.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6622-900x601.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reaching areas of disadvantage</strong></h2>



<p>There are 397 Code Clubs running in Kenya and 622 in South Africa — we estimate we’re reaching over 42,000 young people through Code Clubs and nearly 20,000 through related one-off events such as summer programmes.</p>



<p>This broad reach means that young people who might otherwise have had limited or no access to computing are now engaging with coding, and doing so in truly exciting ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One Kenyan Code Club leader, working in a particularly disadvantaged and marginalised area, said Code Club was so important to young people as it means &#8220;you don&#8217;t have to be left behind&#8221;.<em> </em>They shared that such a large number are attending the club — and that many more are wanting to join — because young people are&nbsp; eager to be<em> </em>&#8220;part of the digital future&#8221;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Impact on young people</strong></h2>



<p>89% of surveyed mentors reported an increase in their young people’s skills in coding and confidence to engage with emerging technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to one South African Code Club mentor, taking part in Code Club “changes your perception and thinking…. it&#8217;s possible to do things… it becomes a reality because it&#8217;s not a really difficult thing. It&#8217;s something that you can do step by step and it really changes the mindset. It really redefines how someone thinks.”</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="668" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6594.jpg" alt="Young people work together on a coding task." class="wp-image-91258" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6594.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6594-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6594-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6594-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6594-800x534.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6594-450x301.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/DSC_6594-900x601.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>Mentors consistently told us that young people are collaborating more, and supporting each other in their learning journeys. One South African young person perfectly captured this spirit:<em> </em>&#8220;if they don&#8217;t know something, we can teach it to them.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mentors also shared that young people are inspired to continue developing their coding and computing skills beyond club sessions. They&#8217;re actively seeking opportunities to deepen their knowledge and are already thinking about how they could use their newfound skills in their future careers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Empowering Code Club mentors</strong></h2>



<p>Overall, club mentors felt well prepared to run clubs and found the training high quality and useful. This is reflected in the high percentage of mentors who agreed that the training increased their skills, confidence, and knowledge, with some partners showing an agreement rate as high as 91%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partners have also worked hard delivering extra training on requested topics such as additional computer skills and mentorship to help mentors feel more confident running Code Clubs.</p>

<p>We recognise the unique challenges that can arise when running clubs in areas of Kenya and South Africa where access to technology and the internet isn’t always consistent. We’re continuing to develop resources and support for these clubs, as well as working with partners to better understand what their clubs need.</p>



<p>We’re also continually reflecting on and refining our train-the-trainer model to understand how best to equip community trainers with the confidence and skills they need to train others.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>



<p>The dedication and hard work of our partners have been instrumental in allowing us to significantly expand our reach and impact in Kenya and South Africa. Alongside this incredible growth, we&#8217;ve strengthened our commitment by increasing the size of our teams operating directly from both countries. This means we can continue to grow our support for our thriving Code Club communities.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re excited to have a number of new partners setting up Code Clubs over the next year. We look forward to sharing the invaluable insights and feedback we&#8217;ve received from our existing partners to ensure our new partners are fully supported and feel empowered to deliver transformative Code Clubs in their areas.</p>

<p>New research by the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/experts-call-greater-focus-childrens-ai-use-research-shows-nearly-1-4-children-use-ai-learning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Turing Institute</a>, published in June, shows that in the UK nearly one in four children aged 8 to 12 is using artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT. With learners exploring these tools at such young ages, it’s more urgent than ever to develop teaching resources that help them understand how AI works.</p>



<p>One of the biggest challenges with AI is that it’s hard to tell how these tools function. With a chatbot, you enter a prompt and the tool returns a response, but what happens in between is invisible. For educators, that’s a problem: how can we help young people become thoughtful, creative users of AI tools if the technology feels like a closed box?</p>

<p>In our May research seminar, we welcomed <strong>Matti Tedre</strong> and <strong>Henriikka Vartiainen</strong> from the University of Eastern Finland. They’ve been <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/machine-learning-education-school-computational-thinking-2-0-research-seminar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working on how to teach about AI for years</a> and were frustrated with existing educational platforms: many of these are either too complex, raise privacy concerns, or rely on coding skills that not all students (or teachers) have. In response, they created an <a href="https://tm.gen-ai.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">award-winning, classroom-friendly tool</a> designed to make AI technology more transparent and more hands-on.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A practical way to teach AI in schools</strong></h2>



<p>Matti and Henriikka began by discussing the unique challenges of teaching young learners about AI technology. Many students start with “folk theories”, for example, thinking that computers understand language like humans do. These misconceptions can be surprisingly hard to shake.</p>



<p>They also pointed out broader issues:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The abstract nature of AI means there are very few research-based approaches to teaching it effectively</li>



<li>Mastery of AI concepts requires sustained practice and curricular change, not just a few one-off interventions</li>



<li>In countries like Finland, where programming isn’t part of the curriculum, any teaching tool must be no-code to be accessible</li>
</ul>



<p>To address these challenges, Matti and Henriikka have spent three years co-designing tools and approaches with local schools, teachers, and over 200 students. Their approach is grounded in educational theory and a set of core AI learning principles:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>No-code for inclusivity:</strong> Removing the need for programming lowers the barrier to entry for both teachers and students</li>



<li><strong>Learner-centred co-design:</strong> Every part of the experience is developed in collaboration with schools to make sure it’s engaging and relevant</li>



<li><strong>Working with personal data:</strong> Learners create and work with their own data sets, which makes the experience more engaging and personally relevant</li>



<li><strong>Integration with school subjects:</strong> Integrating AI concepts into other subjects helps to make the uses of AI tools more concrete for learners</li>



<li><strong>Focus on specific applications:</strong> Rather than teaching about generic ‘AI’, the focus is on specific and understandable applications, such as facial recognition</li>



<li><strong>Hands-on experimentation:</strong> Practical projects help students understand tricky ideas like bias, fairness, and social impact</li>



<li><strong>Collaborative learning:</strong> Working together helps students reflect, question, and learn from each other</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>GenAI Teachable Machine: Opening the box</strong></h2>



<p>Frustrated by existing platforms that require programming skills, raise privacy concerns, or don’t allow collaboration, Matti and Henriikka’s team developed <a href="https://tm.gen-ai.fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GenAI Teachable Machine</a>: a no-code, browser-based tool designed to make key AI concepts tangible. In <a href="https://infedu.vu.lt/journal/INFEDU/article/779/info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the central research study</a>, the team used the tool with Finnish students in grade 4–7 (10 to 14 years of age). It&#8217;s a great introductory tool that could also be used with younger and older students.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1285" height="482" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image.png" alt="GenAI Teachable Machine is freely available online and maintains a “line of sight”: All important steps are visible to the learner." class="wp-image-91219" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image.png 1285w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-300x113.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-500x188.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-768x288.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-800x300.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-450x169.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-900x338.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1285px) 100vw, 1285px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>GenAI Teachable Machine is freely available online and maintains a “line of sight”: All important steps are visible to the learner</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Matti demonstrated how the tool addresses their core AI learning principles with a simple, creative project. Using hand puppets, he trained a model to recognise four distinct classes: a background, a bunny, a calm wolf, and an angry wolf. For each class, he assigned a specific action: a sound, an image, or both. This hands-on process gives students a direct line of sight from the data they might create (visuals of hand puppets) to the final behaviour of the model (outputted sounds and images). They learn about classifiers, training, and confidence levels not as abstract definitions, but as creative tools they can control.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1600" height="823" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-1.png" alt="Matti Tedre demonstrating a bunny and wolf recognition model." class="wp-image-91220" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-1-300x154.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-1-500x257.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-1-768x395.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-1-1536x790.png 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-1-800x412.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-1-450x231.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-1-900x463.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Matti Tedre demonstrating a bunny and wolf recognition model</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But the learning really starts when things don’t work as expected. Students can easily open their models on their phones with an automatically created QR code and then move around the classroom to test their models. At this point, they quickly notice how fragile AI technology can be. For example, in the case of a simple recognition model trained on specific colours or features, with a change of lighting or a different shirt, the model might fail. These “failures” turn into powerful lessons. For instance, a face-recognition app trained mostly on students with blonde hair might not work well for someone with brown hair — sparking immediate conversations about bias. As Matti put it, students very quickly start asking deep questions.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1728" height="1152" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8.jpg" alt="In a computing classroom, two girls concentrate on their programming task." class="wp-image-78793" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8.jpg 1728w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2022/03/NCCE-Enfeild-Primary-8-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1728px) 100vw, 1728px" /></figure></div>


<p>GenAI Teachable Machine also allows students to apply their AI models to the physical world. By connecting to a simple, low-cost robotics kit, students can use their models to control motors, lights, and other actuators. This step into the physical world teaches fundamental concepts that are difficult to grasp in a purely virtual environment. Students learn about causality, as their model&#8217;s classifications trigger real, physical actions. They also learn about the need for a world model — an understanding of how the physical world works — and see that they must take responsibility for what happens when their abstract models have real-world consequences.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1128" height="602" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-2.png" alt="Examples of students’ robot creations." class="wp-image-91221" style="width:720px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-2.png 1128w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-2-300x160.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-2-500x267.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-2-768x410.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-2-800x427.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-2-450x240.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/08/image-2-900x480.png 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1128px) 100vw, 1128px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Examples of students’ robot creations</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>By combining a no-code platform with practical, well-designed learning experiences, Matti, Henriikka, and their team are showing what AI education can look like: hands-on, accessible, and grounded in real understanding. Their work is helping students see inside the box, and giving them the tools to think critically about the AI technologies that are becoming part of their everyday lives.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A long-term partnership in Odisha</h2>



<p>We know that building long-term partnerships with organisations that have local expertise is key to making a real impact for young people. This fact was echoed by people involved in education initiatives worldwide who spoke at the <a href="https://www.wwhge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Works Hub for Global Education</a> 2024 annual conference, which Fiona followed online. Our work in Odisha is an example of this.</p>

<p>We have now been working with our government partner in Odisha, Panchasakha Shikhya Setu (formerly Mo School Abhiyan), for four years. Our journey began in 2021, when we worked together to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/code-club-eastern-india-computer-science-education/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">establish a network of Code Clubs in government and government-aided schools</a> in the state. In 2023, our focus shifted to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/introducing-a-computing-curriculum-in-odisha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing a formal computing curriculum for students in grades 9 and 10</a> (known locally as the Kaushali curriculum), in collaboration with two other partners.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Work in the 2024/2025 academic year</h2>



<p>Adaptation is a crucial aspect of how we ensure our computing resources are accessible to as many young people as possible. For our work in Odisha, we <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/computing-curriculum-framework-adapting-to-indias-diverse-landscapes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adapted content from The Computing Curriculum</a> and then localised it to fit the requirement of the students.</p>

<p>In Odisha&#8217;s June 2024 to April 2025 academic year, we rolled out adapted computing curriculum content for grade 10 students, for students who had already learned with adapted grade 9 content in 2023/24. We worked with our partners to develop the curriculum content and trained 310 master teachers from across Odisha, along with 30 State Resource Groups (SRGs) to support them. Before the end of 2024, the 310 master teachers subsequently trained 8109 teachers, who would reach an estimated 880,000 students with the grade 9 and 10 curriculum content. We had an ongoing responsibility to support 1846 of these teachers in our allocated districts, with an estimated reach to around 205,000 students.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Impact of the grade 9 and 10 curriculum</h2>



<p>In early 2025 we issued a follow-up survey about student learning, content, and training to a sample of teachers in our allocated districts, and 310 teachers responded. (We used a stratified sampling approach designed to ensure the survey results were representative of all teachers.)</p>



<p>At least 87% of teachers agreed that students achieved the outcomes we asked about, e.g. regarding coding skills, staying safe online, and use of data in machine intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, responses related to our grade 9 curriculum remained similarly high compared to 2024 survey responses.</p>

Click to enlarge.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Teachers also expressed their appreciation for the computing curriculum resources and training in free-text comments and interviews, for example:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“IT and coding is essential nowadays. So a good initiative, adding this to schools&#8217; curriculum.” – Teacher in Odisha</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The training was quite informative, interesting and helpful.” – Teacher in Odisha</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It is very useful training for me. It boosts my knowledge and helps me for classroom transaction.” – Teacher in Odisha</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Addressing challenges</h2>



<p>An ongoing challenge in Odisha has been supporting those teachers who lack experience with computing and/or with our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/teach/pedagogy/resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommended teaching approaches for computing</a>. We have been working hard to help these teachers develop the knowledge, skills, and confidence to effectively deliver the curriculum content in the limited time they have alongside their other professional commitments.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="750" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3162-1.jpg" alt="Teachers at a teacher training in Odisha." class="wp-image-91201" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3162-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3162-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3162-1-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3162-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3162-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3162-1-450x338.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3162-1-900x675.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>


<p>In the 2023/2024 academic year, many teachers had told us they needed further training and support. For this reason, we offered longer training in the 2024/25 academic year. We also adapted our training approach based on learning from earlier phases, such as including activities teachers could complete on their smartphones, enabling more hands-on learning while reducing dependence on available IT equipment. The outcome of this was positive: in the follow-up survey, fewer teachers felt they needed additional training to deliver the lessons, and most teachers we interviewed felt this year&#8217;s training was an improvement on the previous year&#8217;s.</p>



<p>Our team also ran weekly webinars to support teachers and address their queries. These were very well received by teachers. Of the responses received to feedback form available after each webinar:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>97% agreed that the “webinar helped me to understand the topics covered more clearly.”</li>



<li>98% agreed that the “webinar was useful to support my teaching.”</li>
</ul>



<p>This was supported by comments from teachers, for example:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“All questions were answered. The webinar was good. Gained a lot. Thank you very much.”&nbsp; – Teacher in Odisha</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I learned many unknown things about Scratch, it will help my classroom teaching.” – Teacher in Odisha</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In this year&#8217;s follow-up survey, teachers also less frequently indicated they felt they needed “additional content to support students”. They provided useful feedback and suggestions regarding the curriculum content, e.g. further simplifying and localising it, which we will incorporate into future resource development.</p>



<p>Another persistent challenge has been limited access to IT equipment and the internet in schools, and what this means for student-device ratios and how teachers are able to deliver the content. For future resources we are developing, we are therefore adapting the amount of content to be delivered over a series of lessons.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next steps for our partnership in Odisha</h2>



<p>In 2025, we are working with the same partners to implement a curriculum for grades 6 to 8, initially in around 460 schools. We and our partners have developed the curriculum content and are currently in the process of training teachers in preparation for classroom delivery.</p>



<p>We are also continuing to support the teachers previously trained on the grade 9 and 10 curriculum through webinars and school visits.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Want to see our curriculum resources?</h2>



<p>You can access our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free Computing Curriculum resources on our website</a> — we are currently working to make the materials for India, and for Kenya, downloadable there.</p>



<p>Look out for the final blog in this mini-series next month, which will focus on our computer science curriculum in Telangana, India.</p>

<p>We love hearing from members of the community and sharing stories of amazing young people, volunteers, and educators who are using their passion for technology to create positive change in the world around them.</p>



<p>Meet Isabelle, a youth mentor at a library Code Club, whose inspiring story tells how a passion for helping others and a love for reading led back to a childhood interest, shaping an unexpected and rewarding journey.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1080" height="1377" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Isabelle-celebrating-her-18th-birthday.jpg" alt="Isabelle celebrating her 18th birthday." class="wp-image-91166" style="width:520px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Isabelle-celebrating-her-18th-birthday.jpg 1080w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Isabelle-celebrating-her-18th-birthday-196x250.jpg 196w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Isabelle-celebrating-her-18th-birthday-500x638.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Isabelle-celebrating-her-18th-birthday-768x979.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Isabelle-celebrating-her-18th-birthday-800x1020.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Isabelle-celebrating-her-18th-birthday-450x574.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Isabelle-celebrating-her-18th-birthday-900x1148.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Saturdays spent at the library</strong></h2>



<p>Isabelle&#8217;s coding journey began around the age of nine. An avid reader, she regularly attended her local library in Stourbridge with her gran. When they saw there was a Code Club held on a Saturday morning, they both decided it might be a good skill for Isabelle to learn.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;I used to have like an entire folder of all the projects I’d completed. I&#8217;ve still got it somewhere in my room!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She quickly progressed through Scratch, Python, and HTML, even finding herself teaching the adults at the club at some points! But, as secondary school approached, her involvement naturally tapered off as she began to focus on her studies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A return through volunteering&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>In secondary school, Isabelle was looking for volunteering opportunities as part of her Duke of Edinburgh (DofE) award. Remembering her positive experiences at the library, and continued love of books, she initially considered volunteering there. Then, she had an idea.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I suddenly thought ‘What if they still do Code Club?’ I really enjoyed it when I did it and I still remembered enough about it to help others. So, I felt like I could actually be useful instead.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Isabelle reached out, and thanks to her gran&#8217;s long-standing connection with the library, she was remembered and welcomed back. What started as a three-month commitment for her DofE award soon extended to six.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I really looked forward to each session at the library and decided to stick with it for the whole time.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Embracing the chaos and connection</strong></h2>



<p>Isabelle&#8217;s return coincided with the Code Club restarting. Stepping into a mentoring role, she quickly found herself in the thick of it. With five computers and a group of new young people, most of whom had no prior coding experience, the first sessions were a whirlwind.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like the best kind of chaos. It doesn&#8217;t get easier as such. But it&#8217;s so fun meeting these new kids, they&#8217;re all different and they bounce off each other.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>She works closely with Lucy, the club leader, helping manage the flow of projects and supporting the children as they navigate everything from creating Scratch accounts to tackling challenging projects.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More than just code</strong></h2>



<p>While the technical skills are central, Isabelle emphasises that Code Club offers so much more. She&#8217;s seen shy children blossom, making new friends and becoming more involved.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I think there&#8217;s the whole element of socialising as well. And beyond coding, kids develop essential IT skills, like learning how to use a mouse and keyboard. Something many who just use tablets and phones don&#8217;t know!”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Four years and counting&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Isabelle, now preparing to go on to further education, could not have predicted how her mentoring journey would turn out. What began as a three-month DofE requirement has turned into a four-year commitment.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It has just never been something that I thought &#8216;oh, I don&#8217;t want to do this anymore&#8217;. It&#8217;s just part of the weekly routine now. It&#8217;s been four years and it&#8217;s shocking how quickly it&#8217;s gone.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Isabelle&#8217;s dedication hasn&#8217;t gone unnoticed. She&#8217;s built strong bonds with the staff and gained invaluable experience. She&#8217;s learned to organise, work in a team, and even run sessions independently, developing skills that will be invaluable for her future.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;I like the bond that I have with the staff and with Lucy. It feels great to be trusted that much and it has just been such a nice experience.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Lucy, Stourbridge Code Club leader and Library Assistant, shared her experience with the club and collaborating.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Since Code Club offers so much more than just coding — confidence building, creativity, friendship, etc. — it plays an important role for children and young people in the community. The library is much more than just a place for books, and hosting Code Club here creates a welcoming space where young people can explore technology away from the classroom.”</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Isabelle has been absolutely fantastic both in supporting us with club admin as well as supporting the children with their coding! She understands the projects inside and out and is brilliant at not only solving problems, but also, importantly, encouraging the club to find ways of solving problems themselves. Our Code Club couldn&#8217;t have become what it is today without her input!”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Isabelle&#8217;s advice for future mentors</strong></h2>



<p>As Isabelle prepares to head off to the Bath Spa University to study media communications and publishing, she offers this advice for other young people considering becoming a Code Club mentor…”just go for it!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Isabelle admits to being anxious at times, but the experience has significantly boosted her confidence.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It built my confidence a bit more. You make friends along the way and you learn a lot of new things. And don&#8217;t worry if you don’t have a lot of coding experience. I don&#8217;t think you need it. I had a little bit but I was still basing it mainly off of reading the project instructions. And in all fairness, the instructions are really helpful!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mentoring at Code Club isn&#8217;t just about teaching, it&#8217;s about learning, growing, and connecting. It&#8217;s an opportunity to give back, build confidence, and discover the joy in supporting the next generation of digital creators. As Isabelle&#8217;s journey shows, sometimes the most rewarding paths are the ones you never planned to take.</p>



<p>Lucy shared why she thinks having youth mentors involved with Code Club is such an important dynamic.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Youth mentors are great as role models and inspiration for children, and as a young person themselves they build such a great rapport with the club members. A mentor who’s closer to their age often feels more approachable, which helps create a comfortable and encouraging environment for them.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If Isabelle&#8217;s story has inspired you, why not explore the world of coding? You can get started at home with over 250 free projects on the Code Club Projects website.</p>

<p>At this time of year, many educators are considering ways to update their content ahead of the new school term. Whether you’re a teaching assistant or head of department, it’s important to ensure that the content you’re updating — or even designing anew — is relevant and high quality, and meet learners’ needs. In today’s blog we’re highlighting ‘ABC learning design’, and how it can be used to rapidly design and improve learning experiences.<br></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is ABC learning design?</strong></h2>



<p>ABC learning design is a rapid, hands-on approach to design and develop blended learning experiences. The framework has traditionally been used at undergrad level, and had a lot of success when used in response to the global pandemic in 2020, when learning experiences had to quickly transition from being delivered in-person to being accessible remotely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The model is centred around six learning types:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Acquisition: Learning by reading, listening, or watching</li>



<li>Collaboration: Learning by working with others towards a common goal, involving co-creation and shared outputs</li>



<li>Discussion: Learning through dialogue, sharing ideas, and responding to others</li>



<li>Investigation: Learning by exploring, comparing, and evaluating new information or experiences</li>



<li>Practice: Learning by applying knowledge and skills, receiving feedback, and refining understanding</li>



<li>Production: Learning by expressing understanding or creating something to demonstrate knowledge and skills</li>
</ul>



<p>Before continuing, it&#8217;s important to distinguish between &#8216;learning types&#8217; and the widely discredited concept of &#8216;learning styles&#8217;. Whilst learning styles refer to fixed characteristics or preferences of learners, learning types refer to different kinds of learning activities and pedagogical approaches that can be designed into a course.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>These learning types are representative simplifications of pre-existing learning theories. For each learning type, educators can use different activities to deliver that type of learning. The activities will depend on your context and what’s right and applicable for your students.</p>



<p><strong>How can I apply ABC learning design?</strong></p>



<p>ABC learning design is often done in a team-based workshop setting (you can do it by yourself as well). Firstly, you analyse your existing content. Consider the goal of your current learning sequence, and assess how your learners are going to reach that goal with the different learning types.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-qw.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcSMiFUtX9Gxm8rpKv6KxsbOBsMrw5DTvCk_gKobjR9LxsoxLkLUCnNy7ZYyqgpaYBj33lRH-6Ncb3degEJGeQyI65PNcd8Iuts4wqhRA_eBq_3nf_23IooPo95LCF-RYc8qx4YlA?key=sKycVwYnLSkTt5scPtoJgQ" alt="Educators in the classroom" style="width:596px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<p>By analysing existing content and activities, you can then identify what&#8217;s missing from your sequence. This allows you to build on existing gaps and consider different types of activities you could implement. You then create a set of learning cards, which help you to storyboard and plan your new learning sequence.</p>



<p>Learning cards are typically postcard-sized and colour-coded to one of the six learning types. Colour coding helps you to tell the cards apart, and to easily see which learning types are or aren&#8217;t included in your sequence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each card has the name and a short description of the learning type on the front, with examples of associated digital or in-person learning activities on the back. The learning cards:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Make the design process more engaging</li>



<li>Help with decision making</li>



<li>Support discussions if you&#8217;re working in a team</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-qw.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeZrE4L9LInJRiaNZq-PVi3QML3jyUNpHcmVH7eApq08Dbl0iGTpYUQd0JhsMqliPjGTl_7I1nD36Z4UmfVsHl-9UYMj8tneiMnZWvZgSnG5LZLK7vqNlfbIWM6EY8RnUjA42NRbw?key=sKycVwYnLSkTt5scPtoJgQ" alt="ABC Learning design cards and their application to an ABC storyboard plan " style="width:474px;height:auto"/></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Adapting ABC learning design for your context</strong></h2>



<p>ABC design can be contextualised to your classroom, practices, and school, and to the technologies you have available. For example, on the back of each learning card you could include a set of activities that have been tried and tested in, or approved by, your school. Alternatively, you could link to other frameworks or teaching approaches that work for you and your students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learning cards can also be used to collect other insights about teaching and learning within your context, and used as reminders of pedagogies to implement, as well as practical concerns. They can also help you to consider if there are opportunities for cross-curricular links within your learning sequence.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A shared toolkit you can reuse</strong></h3>



<p>In a computing department, ABC learning cards can become a shared resource that give fellow educators an understanding of what&#8217;s possible. The cards can be used again and again to help plan future learning experiences.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1890" height="1260" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/AI-research-summit-27.jpg" alt="Educators sharing ideas on a whiteboard" class="wp-image-91148" style="width:633px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/AI-research-summit-27.jpg 1890w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/AI-research-summit-27-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/AI-research-summit-27-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/AI-research-summit-27-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/AI-research-summit-27-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/AI-research-summit-27-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/AI-research-summit-27-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/AI-research-summit-27-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1890px) 100vw, 1890px" /></figure></div>


<p>By running an ABC workshop and creating these learning cards, you and your team will put together a contextualised learning sequence toolkit specific to your school and learners.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Integration with universal design for learning to improve accessibility</strong></h3>



<p>In our blog <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/how-to-build-young-peoples-agency-through-accessible-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to build young people’s agency through accessible learning</a>, we explored the universal design for learning (UDL) framework. UDL aims to support educators to reduce barriers for learners. It helps educators to create learning environments that are accessible and effective for all learners by providing multiple means of engagement, representation, and action and expression.</p>



<p>Gormley et al. (2022) described an initiative to integrate UDL within ABC learning design. They developed adapted ABC learning cards where the reverse side included specific UDL prompts, in addition to the usual example activities. For example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An acquisition card could include the prompt “Will materials be available in a variety of formats (text, audio, and visual)? Will videos be captioned and transcribed?”</li>



<li>A production card could include the prompt “Are there multiple ways for learners to demonstrate their understanding? Can they choose between writing, presenting, or creating?”</li>
</ul>



<p>By including these UDL considerations directly on the ABC cards, the design team ensured that accessibility and inclusivity were central to learning design conversations.</p>



<p>Adding UDL prompts to your learning cards is a fantastic way to help you design accessible learning sequences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Applying ABC learning design: Some ideas for computing educators</strong></h2>



<p>In 2020, during the pandemic, the Computing at School (CAS) Research Working Group worked with classroom teachers to apply ABC learning design in their own contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following some training, teachers analysed their existing classroom activities and then developed a range of suitable alternatives for remote learning, categorising them into low-tech, mid-tech, and high-tech options.&nbsp;<br>The different activity options were then added to their own sets of ABC learning cards and used to help adapt lessons for remote teaching. You can read more about the project and view example cards on the <a href="https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/resources/2020/may/remote-learning-options-abc-cards-for-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAS website</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The benefits of using ABC learning design</strong></h2>



<p>Potential benefits for educators:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Enables more rapid creation and delivery of high-quality content</li>



<li>Allows you to audit your current learning sequence and identify gaps that can be improved upon</li>



<li>Provides a shared, contextualised toolkit for curriculum design</li>
</ul>



<p>Potential benefits for students:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tailored, engaging, high-quality learning experiences</li>
</ul>

<p>This episode features a conversation led by Ben Garside (Raspberry Pi Foundation), with contributions from Leonida Soi (Raspberry Pi Foundation, Kenya), Aimy Lee (Penang Science Cluster, Malaysia), and Monika Katkutė-Gelžinė (Vedliai, Lithuania). All are key collaborators in the Raspberry Pi Foundation&#8217;s AI literacy programme, Experience AI.</p>

</div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The digital literacy gap</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most striking takeaways from the conversation is the universal excitement surrounding AI, coupled with a significant need for foundational digital literacy. As Leonida explains:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;There&#8217;s an excitement about AI literacy, both from the learners and the teachers&#8230; However, one thing to look into is, we still have low digital literacy. As much as we are bringing in AI, if it is not bundled up together with digital literacy, then there is also misuse.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1080" height="720" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image1.jpg" alt=" Leonida Soi, Learning Manager, Raspberry Pi Foundation" class="wp-image-91056" style="width:616px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image1.jpg 1080w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image1-500x333.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image1-900x600.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></figure></div>


<p>This highlights a crucial point: simply introducing AI tools isn&#8217;t enough. A solid understanding of digital fundamentals is essential for responsible and effective use of AI.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Different contexts, shared challenges</strong></h2>



<p>The discussion also reveals the varying approaches to AI education in different countries. Monika shares her experience in Lithuania:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been teaching AI for the last 5 years&#8230; I see a lot of opportunity in it, but a lot of challenges not to overburden teachers with the noise and changes.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Her insight highlights the ongoing need for teacher training and sustainable pedagogical strategies, particularly in a field that evolves so quickly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI literacy beyond computer science</strong></h2>



<p>A key theme throughout the podcast is the importance of integrating AI literacy beyond traditional computer science classrooms. As Leonida emphasises:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s time that AI literacy is looked at from a broader view, not just in computing&#8230; something that cuts across all the learning areas.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>This sentiment is echoed by Monika, who suggests:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;I feel like the entire education system needs to go through an AI filter and come out of it with a bit more efficiency, with a bit more understanding, so it lives in a 21st-century AI world. And I see AI as a form of, you know, building and also as a co-worker for everyone in the future.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1999" height="1325" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image2.jpg" alt="Monica Katkute-Gelzine, Vedliai, Experience AI global partner, Lithuania." class="wp-image-91059" style="width:564px;height:auto" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image2.jpg 1999w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image2-500x331.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image2-768x509.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image2-1536x1018.jpg 1536w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image2-800x530.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image2-450x298.jpg 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/image2-900x597.jpg 900w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px" /></figure></div>


<p>The vision of AI as a &#8220;co-worker&#8221; for all, empowering young people rather than replacing them, offers a powerful perspective for future education.<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Addressing the digital divide</strong></h2>



<p>Equity is another critical issue, particularly in rural areas. Aimy highlights the ongoing challenge of access:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;The digital divide is in the access to devices, as well as access to high-speed internet connections&#8230; but the other thing is also in terms of trained teachers as well.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Leonida adds that in Kenya there&#8217;s a need for unplugged activities to give students an idea of what the world is doing, so that we can start to bridge that gap.</p>



<p>These insights highlight the need for equitable access and innovative teaching methods to ensure no one is left behind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Encouragement for educators: start small, support each other</strong></h2>



<p>For teachers who might feel overwhelmed by the prospect of teaching AI, the advice is clear and encouraging. Aimy suggests:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><em>&#8220;Start small, cover one topic at a time, one concept at a time. Don&#8217;t feel the need to cover everything all at the same time.&#8221; </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We love hearing from members of the community and sharing the stories of amazing young people, volunteers, and educators who are using their passion for technology to create positive change in the world around them.</p>



<p>Seung Woo, also known as Tony, is a 17-year-old student from Canada and the co-founder of his school’s Code Club, alongside his teacher, Kay. A curious and driven teen with big ambitions in computer science, Tony is not only passionate about technology, but also dedicated to building a safe, welcoming space where others can learn, explore, and grow alongside him.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Image-1.jpg" alt="Tony working on a programming project using a laptop." class="wp-image-91091" style="width:720px" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Image-1.jpg 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Image-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Image-1-500x375.jpg 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Image-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/07/Image-1-450x338.jpg 450w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A spark of inspiration</strong></h2>



<p>Tony’s fascination with computers started early, driven by his love of video games, coding, and, perhaps most memorably, his admiration for Tony Stark, the comic-book and film character who becomes the superhero Iron Man! The idea of building something powerful from scratch stuck with him.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“My whole life, I have been curious about the inner workings of a computer and my inspiration for coding is Tony Stark or Iron Man from the Marvel Cinematic Universe!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tony’s early coding journey wasn’t without its challenges. Finding the right resources was difficult, and staying motivated during tough moments was often hard without a support system.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Like many others, I was independently taught, and during this time of independent learning I’d find many different roadblocks and challenges that I had to overcome alone. A big setback for me was finding the right resources in order to learn how to code. Another big obstacle for me was motivation. I would find myself losing interest in a project. I didn’t have the exterior motivation to help me push through the inevitable hardships that come with coding.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s where the idea for a coding club began to take shape.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Creating a community of coders</strong></h2>



<p>Tony co-founded the Code Club at Collège Jeanne-Sauvé in December 2024 with that exact vision in mind — he wanted to provide a fun, collaborative, and welcoming environment where students of all skill levels could explore their love of technology together.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I created the coding club to help everyone on their journey of computer science, no matter their skill level, and that is exactly what it is turning out to be. Finding resources is easier than ever with a teacher and all of the amazing members.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tony’s teacher and co-founder, Kay, shared why Code Club was the right fit for the school.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I thought Code Club was the best way to start our club for a few reasons. The amount of coding language options was varied and appealed to the different learners in our club. It was also important for us to promote our club and let our community know about the presence of a coding club in our school, and Code Club helped us do so via their online presence.”</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What makes Code Club special</strong></h2>



<p>For Tony, the secret ingredient behind his club’s success is simple: teamwork.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Without teamwork, our club wouldn&#8217;t really be a club, it would simply be an ensemble of people coding in their own little cubicles, much like a stereotypical office job, and to me, that does not sound too enjoyable. Teamwork is our little secret ingredient in problem-solving and building motivation, we embrace it by creating a safe space where everyone can speak their minds without judgement!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Members are free to choose their own learning paths. No matter the project, the atmosphere is always filled with laughter, energy, and curiosity.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Coding should be something that is fun — not stressful like others may make it seem. Celebrating achievements, making short term goals, and problem solving with friends are all great ways that we make coding fun in our club. A second word would be teamwork. Without teamwork, our club wouldn’t really be a club.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Teamwork, he adds, transforms what could be a solitary activity into something social and deeply motivating.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Looking to the future</strong></h2>



<p>Tony hopes the club will continue to grow, bringing more students into the world of coding and helping them feel at home in it. His story is a great reminder that learning to code isn’t just about computers — it’s about building community, confidence, and creativity.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I wanted to create a space where everyone would be accepted and encouraged to learn more about coding and not be ashamed to ‘nerd out’ about this subject like I do very frequently. I’ve dreamed of creating a space that embraces this beautiful passion.”</p>
</blockquote>
