   <h2>Flood Watch issued April 5 at 4:05PM CDT until April 6 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">* WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues to be
      possible.
      
      * WHERE...Portions of southern Illinois, including the following
      areas, Alexander, Edwards, Franklin, Gallatin, Hamilton, Hardin,
      Jackson, Jefferson, Johnson, Massac, Perry IL, Pope, Pulaski,
      Saline, Union, Wabash, Wayne IL, White and Williamson, southwest
      Indiana, including the following areas, Gibson, Pike, Posey,
      Spencer, Vanderburgh and Warrick, western Kentucky, including the
      following areas, Ballard, Caldwell, Calloway, Carlisle, Christian,
      Crittenden, Daviess, Fulton, Graves, Henderson, Hickman, Hopkins,
      Livingston, Lyon, Marshall, McCracken, McLean, Muhlenberg, Todd,
      Trigg, Union KY and Webster, and southeast Missouri, including the
      following areas, Bollinger, Butler, Cape Girardeau, Carter,
      Mississippi, New Madrid, Perry MO, Ripley, Scott, Stoddard and
      Wayne MO.
      
      * WHEN...Through Sunday morning.
      
      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
      crossings may be flooded. Extensive street flooding and flooding
      of creeks and rivers are possible. Area creeks and streams are
      running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Flash flooding and flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
      expected. Radar estimates and spotter reports confirmed many
      locations already having received between 4 and 10 inches,
      with
      locally higher amounts. Additional moderate to potentially
      heavy
      rainfall is expected tonight across portions of western
      Kentucky
      with lighter amounts elsewhere. These amounts and resultant
      flooding
      creates a particularly dangerous situation.
