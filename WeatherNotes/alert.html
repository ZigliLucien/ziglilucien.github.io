   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued June 14 at 12:29PM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">There have been reports of funnel clouds today. These funnels
      are developing underneath a few showers that are moving across the
      area. Underneath these showers...spinning columns of air that
      look like tornadoes may continue to develop. These funnels usually
      are very brief and rarely touch the ground. If these funnels do
      touch down...they most likely will not cause damage to life or
      property.
      
      These funnels are due to cooler air aloft...warm moist air near
      the ground...and are usually in association with a strong area of
      low pressure in the upper levels of the atmosphere. Due to little
      or no wind shear...they are usually weak and very brief.
