   <h2>Flood Watch issued June 16 at 1:40AM CDT until June 17 at 12:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Scattered to numerous slow-moving thunderstorms will develop
      through the day. These storms will produce torrential downpours
      which will overwhelm drainage systems and small creeks, leading to
      areas of flash flooding.
      
      * WHAT...Flash flooding caused by excessive rainfall is possible.
      
      * WHERE...Areas of southern Illinois along and south of Highway 13
      and all of western Kentucky.
      
      * WHEN...From 10 AM CDT this morning through 12 AM CDT.
      
      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Flooding may occur
      in poor drainage and urban areas.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Scattered to numerous thunderstorms will develop across
      southern Illinois and western Kentucky from late this morning
      through late tonight. Areas that see thunderstorms could
      receive 1.5 to 3.0 inches of rain in just one or two hours,
      with locally higher amounts up to 4 inches possible.
