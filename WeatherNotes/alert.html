   <h2>Flood Watch issued April 3 at 2:58AM CDT until April 6 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Showers and storms last night produced 1 to 3 inches of rainfall
      across the Quad State. With another 6 to 10 inches of rainfall
      forecast through Sunday, a particularly dangerous flooding and flash
      flooding situation is expected.
      
      * WHAT...Flash flooding and flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
      expected. With 1 to 3 inches already fallen and another 7 to 10
      inches forecast, a particularly dangerous situation is likely to
      develop.
      
      * WHERE...All of southern Illinois, southwest Indiana, western
      Kentucky, and  southeast Missouri.
      
      * WHEN...Through Sunday morning.
      
      * IMPACTS...
      ...This is a particularly dangerous situation...
      
      Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams,
      and other low-lying and flood-prone locations. Creeks and streams
      may rise out of their banks. Low-water crossings may be flooded.
      Extensive street flooding may develop. Flooding may occur in homes,
      businesses and other locations not normally subject to flooding.
      Roadways may wash away near creeks and culverts.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Multiple rounds of locally heavy rainfall over several days
      will result in extreme forecast amounts of up to 1 foot of
      rain that will cause the risk of flash flooding and flooding
      to rise markedly and create a particularly dangerous flooding
      situation.
