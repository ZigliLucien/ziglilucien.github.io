   <h2>Flood Watch issued April 1 at 3:57AM CDT until April 6 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Historically high forecast rainfall amounts will heighten the risk
      of flash flooding and flooding Wednesday through Sunday.
      
      * WHAT...Flash flooding and flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
      expected. Preliminary projections of up to 1 foot of total
      rainfall over parts of the area is not out of the question.
      
      * WHERE...All of southeast Missouri, southern Illinois, southwest
      Indiana, and west Kentucky.
      
      * WHEN...From Wednesday afternoon through Sunday morning.
      
      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Multiple rounds of locally heavy rainfall over several days
      will result in extreme forecast amounts of up to 1 foot of
      rain that will cause the risk of flash flooding and flooding
      to rise markedly.
