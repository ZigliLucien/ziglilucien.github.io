   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued May 17 at 5:09PM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">There have been reports of cold air funnels this afternoon in New
      Madrid County Missouri. These cold air funnels will be possible
      underneath any showers across the region through sunset.
      Underneath these showers...spinning columns of air that look like
      tornadoes may continue to develop. These funnels usually are very
      brief and rarely touch the ground. If these funnels do touch
      down...they most likely will not cause damage to life or property.
      
      Cold air funnels are due to very cool air aloft...warm moist air
      near the ground...and are usually in association with a strong
      area of low pressure in the upper levels of the atmosphere. Due to
      little or no wind shear...they are usually weak and very brief.
