These cold air funnels are developing underneath\nscattered showers and thunderstorms that are moving across the\narea. Underneath these showers, spinning columns of air that look\nlike tornadoes may continue to develop. These funnels usually are\nvery brief and rarely touch the ground. If these funnels do touch\ndown, they most likely will not cause damage to life or property.\n\nCold air funnels are due to very cool air aloft, warm moist air\nnear the ground, and are usually in association with a strong\narea of low pressure in the upper levels of the atmosphere. Due to\nlittle or no wind shear, they are usually weak and very brief.", "instruction": null, "response": "Execute", "parameters": {"AWIPSidentifier": ["SPSPAH"], "WMOidentifier": ["WWUS83 KPAH 081647"], "NWSheadline": ["Cold Air Funnels Possible"], "BLOCKCHANNEL": ["EAS", "NWEM", "CMAS"], "EAS-ORG": ["WXR"]}}}], "title": "Current watches, warnings, and advisories for Jackson (ILZ084) IL", "updated": "2025-05-08T16:48:14+00:00"}
