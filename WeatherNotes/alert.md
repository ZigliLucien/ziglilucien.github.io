   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued April 2 at 10:16AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Thunderstorms have developed in southwest Missouri ahead of a cold
      front and are steadily moving east. This activity is expected to
      encounter increasingly favorable conditions for the development of
      tornadoes and damaging winds as it moves east into the region
      later today. Strong tornadoes are possible as well as significant
      damaging wind.
      
      While the risk of a tornado at any one spot is always low, it will
      be prudent to have a plan and a way to quickly access adequate
      shelter as this activity moves in. React quickly to warnings as
      the average time between a warning and tornado development on
      events like this can be as low as 5 to 10 minutes.

      Doniphan and Van Buren, 2:30-4:00 pm

   <h2>Flood Watch issued April 2 at 3:35AM CDT until April 6 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Historically high forecast rainfall amounts will create a
      particularly dangerous situation with respect to the risk of flash
      flooding and flooding this afternoon through Sunday.
      
      * WHAT...Flash flooding and flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
      expected. Preliminary projections of up to 1 foot of total
      rainfall over parts of the area is not out of the question.

      Kentucky, and southeast Missouri.
      
      * WHEN...From 1 PM CDT  /2 PM EDT/ this afternoon through Sunday

      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
      crossings may be flooded. Extensive street flooding is possible.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Multiple rounds of locally heavy rainfall over several days
      will result in extreme forecast amounts of up to 1 foot of
      rain that will cause the risk of flash flooding and flooding
      to rise markedly and create a particularly dangerous flooding
      situation.
