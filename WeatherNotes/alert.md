   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued July 15 at 2:56PM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">There have been reports of several funnel clouds across the area
      this afternoon. These funnels are developing underneath a few
      showers and storms. Underneath these showers and
      storms...spinning columns of air that look like tornadoes may
      continue to develop. The funnels are usually very brief and weak
      due to the lack of wind shear. It is also very rare that the
      funnels touch the ground. If these funnels do touch down...they
      most likely will not cause damage to life or property.
