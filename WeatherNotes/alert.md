   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued April 2 at 3:23PM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">A large cluster of severe thunderstorms continues across portions
      of south central Missouri and north central Arkansas. Other
      individual cells are beginning to develop across parts of
      southwest Tennessee. These cells are encountering an increasingly
      favorable environment for tornadoes and damaging winds.
      
      The cluster of storms in Missouri should move into southeast
      Missouri over the next several hours and new cell formation
      immediately ahead of the line is possible. Individuals in
      southeast Missouri should begin very closely monitoring the
      weather for potential warnings. This cluster will then move east
      across the rest of the quad state through early this evening.
      
      The cells in Tennessee may continue moving northeast into western
      Kentucky and southeast Missouri by 5 to 6 pm and eventually merge
      with the activity moving in from the west.
      
      Strong and potentially long tracked tornadoes will be possible
      with this activity, with conditions expected to be most favorable
      for this between 5 and 9 pm tonight. Widespread damaging wind
      conditions may develop as the cells form into a line. Large hail
      is also possible. Continue to monitor NOAA Weather Radio, local
      media and the latest official forecast information for updates.

   <h2>Flood Watch issued April 2 at 1:12PM CDT until April 6 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Historically high forecast rainfall amounts will create a
      particularly dangerous situation flash flooding and flooding
      situation this afternoon through Sunday.
      
      * WHAT...Flash flooding and flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
      expected. Preliminary projections of up to 1 foot of total
      rainfall over parts of the area is not out of the question.
      
      * WHERE...All of southeast Missouri, southern Illinois, southwest
      Indiana and Western Kentucky
      
      * WHEN...Through Sunday morning.
      
      * IMPACTS...
      ...This is a particularly dangerous situation...
      
      Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams,
      and other low-lying and flood-prone locations. Creeks and streams
      may rise out of their banks. Low-water crossings may be flooded.
      Extensive street flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are
      possible. Flooding may occur in homes, businesses and other
      locations not normally subject to flooding. Roadways may wash away
      near creeks and culverts.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Multiple rounds of locally heavy rainfall over several days
      will result in extreme forecast amounts of up to 1 foot of
      rain that will cause the risk of flash flooding and flooding
      to rise markedly and create a particularly dangerous flooding
      situation.
