   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued January 20 at 11:50PM CST by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Areas of light precipitation will develop across the region after
      3am. With temperatures initially below the freezing mark and cold
      ground temperatures, precipitation will start out as light
      freezing drizzle or light snow. This may lead to slick spots on
      roadways, which may impact the morning commute. South winds will
      help temperatures slowly rise overnight to above freezing early
      Wednesday morning, changing precipitation over to rain and
      improving any travel issues.
      
      Allow extra time to reach your destination, and leave plenty of
      distance between you and the vehicle in front of you.
