   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued May 3 at 3:05PM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Gusty thunderstorms capable of producing cold air funnel clouds
      and small hail are forecast through early tonight. These cold air
      funnels are developing underneath thunderstorms that are moving
      across the area. Underneath these showers...spinning columns of
      air that look like tornadoes may continue to develop. These
      funnels usually are very brief and rarely touch the ground. If
      these funnels do touch down...they most likely will not cause
      damage to life or property.
      
      Cold air funnels are due to very cool air aloft...warm moist air
      near the ground...and are usually in association with a strong
      area of low pressure in the upper levels of the atmosphere. Due to
      little or no wind shear...they are usually weak and very brief.
