   <div style="font-size:120%">Historically high forecast rainfall amounts will create a
      particularly dangerous situation with respect to the risk of flash
      flooding and flooding this afternoon through Sunday.
      
      * WHAT...Flash flooding and flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
      expected. Preliminary projections of up to 1 foot of total
      rainfall over parts of the area is not out of the question.

      Kentucky, and southeast Missouri.
      
      * WHEN...From 1 PM CDT  /2 PM EDT/ this afternoon through Sunday

      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
      crossings may be flooded. Extensive street flooding is possible.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Multiple rounds of locally heavy rainfall over several days
      will result in extreme forecast amounts of up to 1 foot of
      rain that will cause the risk of flash flooding and flooding
      to rise markedly and create a particularly dangerous flooding
      situation.
