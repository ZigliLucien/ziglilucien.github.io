   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued May 8 at 11:47AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">There have been a few reports of cold air funnels in southeast
      Missouri. These cold air funnels are developing underneath
      scattered showers and thunderstorms that are moving across the
      area. Underneath these showers, spinning columns of air that look
      like tornadoes may continue to develop. These funnels usually are
      very brief and rarely touch the ground. If these funnels do touch
      down, they most likely will not cause damage to life or property.
      
      Cold air funnels are due to very cool air aloft, warm moist air
      near the ground, and are usually in association with a strong
      area of low pressure in the upper levels of the atmosphere. Due to
      little or no wind shear, they are usually weak and very brief.
