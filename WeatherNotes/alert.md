   <div style="font-size:120%">Relative humidity values are expected to fall to 20 to 30 percent
      today. Southwest winds will be modest at 10 to 15 mph. Given the
      very dry conditions across the region there is an elevated risk
      for wildfire/brushfire growth and spread today for any fires that
      get started. Exercise extra caution today in avoiding actions that
      could lead to fire starts.
