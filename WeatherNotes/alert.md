   <h2>Flood Watch issued April 5 at 1:29AM CDT until April 6 at 7:00AM CDT by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">The forecast of up to a foot of rain is on track, with many
      locations nearing that total and experiencing widespread flooding.
      Additional heavy rain will only exacerbate ongoing flooding and make
      it even worse and more widespread.
      
      * WHAT...Flooding caused by excessive rainfall continues. Additional
      heavy rains will only exacerbate ongoing flooding and make it
      worse and more widespread...resulting in particularly dangerous
      situations.
      
      * WHERE...All of southeast Missouri, southern Illinois, southwest
      Indiana, and western Kentucky.
      
      * WHEN...Through Sunday morning.
      
      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
      crossings may be flooded. Extensive street flooding and flooding
      of creeks and rivers are possible. Area creeks and streams are
      running high and could flood with more heavy rain. Be prepared as
      rising water levels may cause particularly dangerous situations
      where evacuations could become necessary.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Flash flooding and flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
      expected. With the forecast on track and radar estimates and
      spotter reports confirming many locations already having
      received between 4 and 10 inches, anticipated additional
      bouts of heavy rain will put everyone in the half foot to
      foot range. A few isolated totals greater than a foot are not
      out of the question. These amounts and resultant flooding
      creates a particularly dangerous situation.
