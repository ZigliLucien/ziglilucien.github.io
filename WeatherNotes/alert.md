      * WHAT...Flash flooding and flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
      expected. Preliminary projections of up to 1 foot of total
      rainfall over parts of the area is not out of the question.

      Indiana and Western Kentucky
      
      * WHEN...Through Sunday morning.
      
      * IMPACTS...
      ...This is a particularly dangerous situation...
      
      Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams,
      and other low-lying and flood-prone locations. Creeks and streams
      may rise out of their banks. Low-water crossings may be flooded.
      Extensive street flooding and flooding of creeks and rivers are
      possible. Flooding may occur in homes, businesses and other
      locations not normally subject to flooding. Roadways may wash away
      near creeks and culverts.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Multiple rounds of locally heavy rainfall over several days
      will result in extreme forecast amounts of up to 1 foot of
      rain that will cause the risk of flash flooding and flooding
      to rise markedly and create a particularly dangerous flooding
      situation.
