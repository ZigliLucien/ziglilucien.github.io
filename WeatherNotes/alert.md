      areas, Alexander, Edwards, Franklin, Gallatin, Hamilton, Hardin,
      Jackson, Jefferson, Johnson, Massac, Perry IL, Pope, Pulaski,
      Saline, Union, Wabash, Wayne IL, White and Williamson, southwest

      Wayne MO.
      
      * WHEN...Through Sunday morning.
      
      * IMPACTS...Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers,
      creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations.
      Creeks and streams may rise out of their banks. Low-water
      crossings may be flooded. Extensive street flooding and flooding
      of creeks and rivers are possible. Area creeks and streams are
      running high and could flood with more heavy rain.
      
      * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...
      - Flash flooding and flooding caused by excessive rainfall is
      expected. Radar estimates and spotter reports confirmed many
      locations already having received between 4 and 10 inches,
      with
      locally higher amounts. Additional moderate to potentially
      heavy
      rainfall is expected tonight across portions of western
      Kentucky
      with lighter amounts elsewhere. These amounts and resultant
      flooding
      creates a particularly dangerous situation.
