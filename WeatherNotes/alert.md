   <h2>Special Weather Statement issued February 24 at 12:48AM CST by NWS Paducah KY</h2>
   <div style="font-size:120%">Strong gusty southwest winds are expected to develop later today.
      Gusts are expected between 25 and 35 mph. Relative humidity values
      are expected to drop to 25 to 35 percent in the afternoon. Given
      the very dry conditions across the region there is an elevated
      risk for wildfire/brushfire growth and spread today for any fires
      that get started. Exercise extra caution today in avoiding actions
      that could lead to fire starts.
