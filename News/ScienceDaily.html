In a groundbreaking study, scientists combined high-tech climate models with deep-ocean sediment analysis to pinpoint five such events. The alarming part?

This giant thread, 10 times the mass of the Milky Way and stretching 23 million light-years, is one of the best confirmations yet of what cosmological simulations have long predicted: that vast, faint filaments connect the Universe s largest structures in a cosmic web.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
