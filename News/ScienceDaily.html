For families once haunted by genetic risk, this science offers more than treatment—it offers transformation.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>In a striking new study, the anti-obesity drug tirzepatide, known as Mounjaro and Zepbound, not only triggered significant weight loss in obese mice but also slashed breast cancer tumor growth. The research, presented at ENDO 2025, links body fat reduction to better cancer outcomes, suggesting that these next-generation weight-loss drugs might offer unexpected benefits beyond metabolic health. With traditional dieting often falling short, this dual-action approach could reshape how doctors tackle obesity-related cancers.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>A cat named Pepper has once again helped scientists discover a new virus—this time a mysterious orthoreovirus found in a shrew. Researchers from the University of Florida, including virologist John Lednicky, identified this strain during unrelated testing and published its genome. Although once thought to be harmless, these viruses are increasingly linked to serious diseases in humans and animals. With previous discoveries also pointing to a pattern of viral emergence in wildlife, scientists stress the need for more surveillance—and Pepper remains an unlikely but reliable viral scout.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>A surprising new study has uncovered over 200 misfolded proteins in the brains of aging rats with cognitive decline, beyond the infamous amyloid and tau plaques long blamed for Alzheimer’s. These shape-shifting proteins don’t clump into visible plaques, making them harder to detect but potentially just as harmful. Scientists believe these “stealth” molecules could evade the brain’s cleanup systems and quietly impair memory and brain function. The discovery opens a new frontier in understanding dementia and could lead to entirely new targets for treatment and prevention.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
