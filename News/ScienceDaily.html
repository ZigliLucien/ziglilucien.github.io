The COSMOS-Web project not only challenges long-held beliefs about galaxy formation in the early universe but also unexpectedly revealed 10 times more galaxies than anticipated along with supermassive black holes Hubble couldn t see.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Dapagliflozin, an SGLT-2 inhibitor typically used for type 2 diabetes, significantly improved liver inflammation and scarring in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) during a clinical trial in China. Participants on the drug saw better liver outcomes and fewer side effects than those on a placebo. Although more research is needed, especially in diverse populations, this finding hints at a transformative role for existing medications in tackling liver diseases.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

A sweeping 40-year study shows a direct link between the rise in extreme weather events and the growing number of species landing on the endangered list. Europe, the Amazon, and Madagascar have become danger zones, with amphibians unable to adapt quickly enough. But there s hope scientists are calling for focused conservation efforts like habitat restoration and micro-refuges to help these vulnerable creatures survive.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

They've created a cutting-edge transistor using gallium-doped indium oxide with a novel "gate-all-around" structure. By precisely engineering the material's atomic structure, the new device achieves remarkable electron mobility and stability. This breakthrough could fuel faster, more reliable electronics powering future technologies from AI to big data systems.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
