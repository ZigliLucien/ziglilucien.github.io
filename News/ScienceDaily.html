In real-world underwater testing nearly a kilometer below the surface, LAHB lost more than 80% of its mass after 13 months, while traditional PLA plastic remained completely intact. The secret? Colonies of deep-sea microbes actively broke down the material using specialized enzymes, converting it into harmless byproducts like CO and water.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
