Scientists believe these “stealth” molecules could evade the brain’s cleanup systems and quietly impair memory and brain function. The discovery opens a new frontier in understanding dementia and could lead to entirely new targets for treatment and prevention.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

The device contains a powdered form of glucagon and can be remotely triggered—either manually or automatically by a glucose monitor—to release the hormone when blood sugar drops too low. This offers a potentially life-saving safety net, especially during sleep or for young children.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

That’s what researchers at Columbia and Brookhaven are doing—constructing intricate 3D nanostructures by harnessing the predictable folding of DNA strands. Their new design method uses voxel-like building blocks and an algorithm called MOSES to fabricate nanoscale devices in parallel, with applications ranging from optical computing to bio-scaffolds. Unlike traditional lithography or 3D printing, this self-assembly process occurs entirely in water and could revolutionize the future of nanomanufacturing.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Researchers warn that while crops may grow faster, they may also become less nourishing, with fewer minerals, proteins, and antioxidants raising concerns about obesity, weakened immunity, and chronic diseases.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
