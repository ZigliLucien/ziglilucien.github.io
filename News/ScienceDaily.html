A groundbreaking worldwide study led by researchers from Università Cattolica and Stanford University reveals that most lives were saved before individuals were exposed to the virus, particularly during the Omicron period and among those aged 60+. The researchers also calculated 14.8 million years of life saved, with the elderly gaining the majority of these benefits.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>Mesopelagic fish, long overlooked in ocean chemistry, are now proven to excrete carbonate minerals much like their shallow-water counterparts—despite living in dark, high-pressure depths. Using the deep-dwelling blackbelly rosefish, researchers have demonstrated that carbonate production is consistent across ocean layers, bolstering global carbon cycle models. These findings reveal that these abundant fish play a hidden but crucial role in regulating Earth’s ocean chemistry and could reshape how we understand deep-sea contributions to climate processes.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>Scientists at UCSF have uncovered how certain immune cells in the brain, called microglia, can effectively digest toxic amyloid beta plaques that cause Alzheimer’s. They identified a key receptor, ADGRG1, that enables this protective action. When microglia lack this receptor, plaque builds up quickly, causing memory loss and brain damage. But when the receptor is present, it seems to help keep Alzheimer's symptoms mild. Since ADGRG1 belongs to a drug-friendly family of receptors, this opens the door to future therapies that could enhance brain immunity and protect against Alzheimer’s in more people.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>A team at KAUST has revealed that the short lifespan of aqueous batteries is primarily due to "free water" molecules triggering harmful chemical reactions at the anode. By adding affordable sulfate salts like zinc sulfate, they significantly reduced this issue—boosting battery life over tenfold. The sulfate acts as a “water glue,” stabilizing the water structure and halting the energy-wasting reactions. Not only is this solution simple and cost-effective, but early results suggest it may be a universal fix for various types of metal-anode aqueous batteries.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
