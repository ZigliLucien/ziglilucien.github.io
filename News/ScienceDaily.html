A new thermodynamic framework makes it possible to calculate these overlooked costs and compare different metabolic pathways. When tested on photosynthesis, the method showed that nature favors pathways that minimize wasted energy. This offers a powerful new lens on how life’s core processes may have evolved.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

The data revealed the waves were far more complex and scattered than scientists expected, overturning the idea that large tsunamis travel as a single, stable wave. Ocean sensors confirmed the quake’s rupture was longer than earlier models suggested. Together, the findings could reshape how tsunamis are modeled and predicted.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Instead of shipping construction materials from Earth, researchers are exploring how to use Martian soil as the raw ingredient. Two tough microbes could work together to bind dust into a concrete-like material and even help generate oxygen. The vision: 3D-print habitats using local resources, one experiment at a time.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
