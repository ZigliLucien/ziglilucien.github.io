Older adults with weaker, more disrupted activity patterns were far more likely to develop dementia than those with steady routines. A later daily energy peak was also linked to higher risk. The study points to the body clock as a possible early warning sign for cognitive decline.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

A new study found strong anatomical evidence that Sahelanthropus tchadensis was bipedal, including a ligament attachment seen only in human ancestors. Despite its ape-like appearance and small brain, its leg and hip structure suggest it moved confidently on two legs. The finding places bipedalism near the very root of the human family tree.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>The brain constantly blends split-second reactions with slower, more thoughtful processing, and new research shows how it pulls this off. Scientists discovered that brain regions operate on different internal clocks and rely on white matter connections to share information across these timescales. The way this timing is organized affects how efficiently the brain switches between activity patterns tied to behavior. Differences in this system may help explain why people vary in cognitive ability.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
