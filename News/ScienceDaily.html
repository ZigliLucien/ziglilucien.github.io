Brain scans revealed distinct patterns as infants looked at pictures of animals, toys, and everyday objects, showing early category recognition. Scientists used AI to help decode these patterns, offering a rare glimpse into infant thinking. The results suggest babies begin learning and understanding far sooner than expected.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Researchers found the iron was in a form that marine life could not easily use. This means more melting ice does not automatically boost carbon absorption. In the future, Antarctic ice loss could actually reduce the ocean’s ability to slow climate change.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
