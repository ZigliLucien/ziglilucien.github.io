This surprising combination wasn’t supposed to happen, according to many models, and suggests scientists may be catching the black hole during a brief, unstable growth spurt.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

After analyzing more than 20 clinical trials involving over 2,100 adults, researchers found no strong proof that cannabis products outperform placebos in relieving neuropathic pain. Even when small improvements were reported, especially with THC-CBD combinations, they weren’t large enough to make a real difference in daily life.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Stanford researchers found that a nanoscale silver treatment can greatly strengthen the battery’s ceramic core. The silver helps seal tiny flaws and prevents lithium from causing further damage. This simple approach could help unlock next-generation batteries.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
