This simple trick prevents salt buildup—a major barrier to commercialization—by altering local chemistry just enough to keep salts dissolved and flowing. The result? A device that ran for over 4,500 hours without clogging, using common catalysts and scalable technology. It's a breakthrough that could make green CO₂ conversion far more viable in the real world.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Researchers analyzed blood markers from nearly 1,900 people and found that higher levels of linoleic acid — an omega-6 fat commonly found in seed oils — were linked to lower inflammation and better cardiometabolic health. The study used direct biomarkers instead of diet surveys, making its findings more robust. These results support a growing body of evidence that seed oils, far from fueling disease, may actually help protect against heart disease and type 2 diabetes.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

These glass spheres, tiny yet mesmerizing, formed billions of years ago during fiery eruptions that launched molten droplets skyward, instantly freezing in space. Now, using advanced instruments that didn't exist in the 1970s, scientists have examined the beads in unprecedented detail. The result is a remarkable window into the moon s dynamic geological history, revealing how eruption styles evolved and how lunar conditions once mirrored explosive events we see on Earth today.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
