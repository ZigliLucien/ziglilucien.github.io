The study found participants on these medications felt less drunk despite consuming the same amount of alcohol. This could point to a safer, faster-acting way to help people reduce drinking—distinct from traditional treatments that target the brain directly.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

A unique imbalance in potassium isotopes points to remnants of “proto Earth” material that survived the planet’s violent formation. The study suggests the original building blocks of Earth remain hidden beneath its surface, offering a direct glimpse into our planet’s ancient origins.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
