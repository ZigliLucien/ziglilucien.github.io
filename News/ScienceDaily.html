A large national study found that more adolescents are vaping THC, CBD, and especially synthetic cannabinoids, which are often unregulated and far more dangerous. Even more troubling, many teens don’t know what’s in their vape pens at all. Researchers also found that girls are now more likely than boys to vape these substances. As these mysterious and risky chemicals gain popularity, scientists are sounding the alarm about the urgent need for better education, regulation, and awareness.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>A sweeping review of more than a century’s research upends the popular notion that left-handers are naturally more creative. Cornell psychologist Daniel Casasanto’s team sifted nearly a thousand studies, ultimately finding no consistent advantage for lefties on standard divergent-thinking tests—and even a slight edge for right-handers in some. The myth appears to thrive on coincidence: left-handedness is rare and so is creative genius, plus lefties’ overrepresentation in art and music gets cherry-picked while other professions are ignored.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
