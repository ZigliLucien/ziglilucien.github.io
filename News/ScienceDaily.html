These early creatures likely had segmented bodies, muscle systems, and even directional movement, signaling a surprising level of biological sophistication.

These ancient "carbon burps" led to dangerous periods of ocean anoxia, which stalled marine biodiversity and potentially reshaped entire ecosystems. In a groundbreaking study, scientists combined high-tech climate models with deep-ocean sediment analysis to pinpoint five such events. The alarming part? Today's human-driven CO₂ emissions are skyrocketing at speeds hundreds of times faster than those ancient upheavals—raising urgent questions about how modern oceans, particularly coastal zones rich in marine life, might react.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

This new technique avoids the downsides of chemical tagging, which can distort results and slow research. By analyzing how cells move under alternating electric fields, the researchers found they could accurately detect senescent skin cells based on their electrical properties. The approach is fast, non-invasive, and could transform how we study aging and age-related diseases like Alzheimer’s or diabetes.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>Quantum computing just got a significant boost thanks to researchers at the University of Osaka, who developed a much more efficient way to create "magic states" a key component for fault-tolerant quantum computers. By pioneering a low-level, or "level-zero," distillation method, they dramatically reduced the number of qubits and computational resources needed, overcoming one of the biggest obstacles: quantum noise. This innovation could accelerate the arrival of powerful quantum machines capable of revolutionizing industries from finance to biotech.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>Fresh concerns have emerged about the platelet studies underpinning the FDA approval of ticagrelor, AstraZeneca's multibillion-dollar heart drug. A new BMJ investigation reveals data discrepancies, missing lab readings, and questions about the integrity of the trial process. Notably, key results reported in a major cardiology journal were inaccurately presented, and some study contributors were omitted or denied involvement. With generics on the horizon, critics say these revelations highlight potential dangers, including severe rebound effects and bleeding risks, that were never properly disclosed.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
