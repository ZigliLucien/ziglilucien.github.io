Researchers found that macrophages produce a protein that locks them into a chronic inflammatory state, making infections like sepsis more deadly in older adults. Turning off this signal reduced inflammation and improved survival in older models. The findings hint at future treatments that could dial back harmful immune overreactions.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>Researchers have found that a natural aging-related molecule can repair key memory processes affected by Alzheimer’s disease. The compound improves communication between brain cells and restores early memory abilities that typically fade first. Because it already exists in the body and declines with age, boosting it may offer a safer way to protect the brain. The discovery hints at a new strategy for slowing cognitive ageing before severe damage sets in.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

The image is sharper, deeper, and wider than anything previously released, uncovering both star-forming regions and the remains of ancient stellar explosions. Scientists can now better distinguish where stars are being born versus where they’ve met dramatic ends. The discovery opens powerful new ways to study the life cycle of stars and the shape of our galaxy.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
