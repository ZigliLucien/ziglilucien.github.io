Using over 100 years of temperature and salinity data, researchers showed that only models with a weakening AMOC could recreate the observed changes. The implications are vast, influencing everything from European weather to marine ecosystems, and casting doubt on many recent climate models that underestimated this oceanic shift.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>UC San Diego engineers have created a passive evaporative cooling membrane that could dramatically slash energy use in data centers. As demand for AI and cloud computing soars, traditional cooling systems struggle to keep up efficiently. This innovative fiber membrane uses capillary action to evaporate liquid and draw heat away without fans or pumps. It performs with record-breaking heat flux and is stable under high-stress operation.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

By pairing classic stem cell manipulation with precise CRISPR gene editing, they ve built a standardized platform that mirrors autism-linked genetic conditions in mice. These models not only replicate autism-related traits but also expose key dysfunctions, like the brain s inability to clean up faulty proteins.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
