When dogs watched how humans treated other dogs, they didn’t favor the kinder person later. Even direct interactions didn’t sway their behavior. The study suggests dogs' reputational judgments might be more nuanced—or harder to study—than we realized.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>A gene called SDR42E1 has been identified as a key player in how our bodies absorb and process vitamin D. Researchers found that disabling this gene in colorectal cancer cells not only crippled their survival but also disrupted thousands of other genes tied to cancer and metabolism. This opens the door to highly targeted cancer therapies—by either cutting off vitamin D supply to tumors or enhancing the gene’s activity to boost health. The findings hint at vast possibilities in treating diseases influenced by vitamin D, though long-term impacts remain uncertain.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Elephants in Sri Lanka and India have learned to beg for snacks sugary treats and human food leading to deadly encounters, injuries, and even the ingestion of plastic. Once wild animals become accustomed to handouts, they lose their natural instincts, grow bolder, and risk both their lives and the safety of humans.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

CVI affects the ability of veins especially in the legs to return blood to the heart, often leading to swelling, pain, skin changes, and ulcers. The American Heart Association warns that CVI isn t just a cosmetic issue; it's strongly linked to cardiovascular disease and increased mortality, even when other risk factors are accounted for. Seniors, smokers, those with sedentary lifestyles, and people with obesity are particularly at risk.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
