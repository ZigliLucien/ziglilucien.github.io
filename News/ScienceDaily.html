Scientists discovered that oleic acid, a major component of many high-fat foods, uniquely spurs the growth of new fat cells by manipulating specific proteins in the body. Unlike other fats, it boosts the number of "fat cell soldiers," setting the stage for obesity and possibly chronic diseases. This unexpected twist reveals that the type of fat we eat, not just how much, may play a crucial role in our health.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Scientists discovered a unique sugar in these marine creatures that can block Sulf-2, an enzyme that cancer cells use to spread. Unlike traditional medications, this compound doesn t cause dangerous blood clotting issues and offers a cleaner, potentially more sustainable way to develop carbohydrate-based drugs if scientists can find a way to synthesize it in the lab.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>California s solar energy boom is often hailed as a green success story but a new study reveals a murkier reality beneath the sunlit panels. Researchers uncover seven distinct forms of corruption threatening the integrity of the state s clean energy expansion, including favoritism, land grabs, and misleading environmental claims. Perhaps most eyebrow-raising are allegations of romantic entanglements between senior officials and solar lobbyists, blurring the lines between personal influence and public interest. The report paints a picture of a solar sector racing ahead while governance and ethical safeguards fall dangerously behind.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

This polarized light scattered by the universe's very first stars over 13 billion years ago offers a new lens into the Cosmic Dawn. Overcoming extreme technical challenges, the CLASS team matched their data with satellite readings to isolate this ancient signal. These insights could reshape our understanding of the universe s early evolution, and what it reveals about mysterious components like dark matter and neutrinos.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
