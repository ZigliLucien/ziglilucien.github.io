Because such chilled gas should evaporate quickly in million-degree surroundings, its survival hints that the bubbles are only about a million years old. Ultraviolet data from Hubble backs the discovery, and the clouds’ million-mph speeds reinforce the bubbles’ youth. The find forces scientists to rethink how energy and matter flow through galaxies.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

These micro-crystals, just nanometers wide, were identified through simulations and lab experiments, revealing that even the most common ice in space retains a surprising structure. This has major implications not just for astrophysics, but also for theories about the origin of life and advanced materials technology.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

This exciting find, alongside ancient turtles and armored amphibians, sheds light on a key moment in Earth's history when older animal groups overlapped with evolutionary newcomers. The remarkably preserved fossils, including over 1,200 specimens, offer a rare glimpse into a vibrant world just before a mass extinction reshaped life on Earth.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
