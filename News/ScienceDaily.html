Their innovative technique, combining aerial imagery with statistical correction for turtle movement, exposes major flaws in traditional counting methods and opens doors to more precise wildlife monitoring worldwide.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

This rare phenomenon, known as light-on-light scattering, challenges the classical idea that light waves pass through each other untouched.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

The technology makes it possible to create hand-held spectroscopy devices and holds promise for the development of devices that incorporate an array of the new sensors to serve as next-generation imaging spectrometers.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
