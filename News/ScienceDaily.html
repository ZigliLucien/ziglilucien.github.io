Their experiments show that ribose binds more readily and selectively to phosphate compared to other similar sugars, forming a structure ideal for RNA formation. This discovery hints at how nature might have selected specific molecules long before enzymes or life existed, and could reshape our understanding of life’s chemical origins.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

By analyzing thousands of samples over three years, scientists discovered that juvenile bats frequently host multiple coronaviruses simultaneously—offering a real-time window into how new strains might arise. These findings, while involving non-human-infecting viruses, provide a powerful model to forecast how dangerous variants could eventually spill over into humans, especially as environmental pressures bring bats closer to human habitats.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
