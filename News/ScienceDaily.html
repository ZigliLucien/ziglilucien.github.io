By changing nutrient availability in the intestine, it alters gut bacteria and increases levels of a microbial molecule that travels to the bone marrow. This signal reshapes immune cell production, strengthening anti-cancer defenses and making metastatic sites harder for tumors to colonize. Patient data suggest this immune rewiring is linked to better survival.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Researchers found that after several years, red blood cells can begin interfering with healthy blood vessel function. This harmful shift was not present in newly diagnosed patients but emerged over time. A small molecule inside blood cells may help flag rising cardiovascular risk early.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
