The injectable material lasts far longer than current options, staying intact for weeks instead of breaking down quickly. By acting like a molecular glue, it gives damaged vocal cords more time to heal. The team hopes it could eventually lead to a gentler, longer-lasting treatment for voice loss.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

By delivering mRNA to the liver, they created a temporary source of immune-boosting signals that normally come from the thymus. Older mice treated this way produced more effective T cells and responded far better to vaccines and cancer treatments. The strategy could one day help extend healthy years of life.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

They found that the vaccines can spark a two-step immune reaction that floods the body with inflammatory signals, drawing aggressive immune cells into the heart and causing temporary injury.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
