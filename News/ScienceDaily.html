New research presented at ENDO 2025 highlights how obesity—linked to 13 different cancers—is now a major contributor to cancer mortality, especially in underserved and rural populations. Despite the growing awareness of obesity’s broader health impacts, this surge in cancer fatalities reveals an urgent need for targeted public health interventions and equitable access to care.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

This large-scale Taiwanese study links sweeteners to hormonal changes and gut bacteria imbalances that can speed up puberty, with effects differing between boys and girls. Early onset puberty has been tied to serious health consequences later in life, including emotional stress and metabolic disorders. The findings could reshape dietary recommendations and encourage genetic screening to mitigate long-term risks.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Packed with stars of several different ages, this glittering sphere helps astronomers test whether layered “generations” of suns are common across galaxies. By comparing NGC 1786 and other dwarf-galaxy clusters with those orbiting the Milky Way, researchers hope to retrace how both the LMC and our own galaxy pieced themselves together in the early universe.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
