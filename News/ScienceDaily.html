The study suggests Earth’s continents didn’t begin growing until hundreds of millions of years after the planet itself formed. When scientists compared the rocks with Moon samples from the Apollo missions, they found a remarkable match. The results support the idea that a massive cosmic impact gave birth to the Moon.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Researchers analyzing nationwide data found that insufficient sleep was more closely tied to shorter life expectancy than diet, exercise, or loneliness. The connection was consistent year after year and across most U.S. states. The takeaway is simple but powerful: getting seven to nine hours of sleep may be one of the best things you can do for long-term health.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>Although the gut renews itself constantly, its stem cells accumulate age-related molecular changes that quietly alter how genes are switched on and off. Scientists found that this “epigenetic drift” follows a clear pattern and appears in both aging intestines and most colon cancers. Some regions age faster than others, forming a patchwork of weakened tissue more prone to degeneration. Encouragingly, researchers showed this drift can be slowed—and partly reversed—by restoring iron levels or key cellular signals.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
