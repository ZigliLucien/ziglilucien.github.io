By blocking minor splicing, researchers triggered DNA damage and activated the body’s own cancer-defense system, killing cancer cells while sparing healthy ones.

But when the receptor is present, it seems to help keep Alzheimer's symptoms mild.

This ancient RNA revealed that the virus had already adapted to humans at the very start of the pandemic, carrying mutations that made it both more infectious and more immune-resistant. By pioneering a new method to recover fragile RNA from preserved tissue, researchers gained rare insights into how flu viruses evolve. The study not only revives the history of one of humanity's deadliest outbreaks but also arms us with critical knowledge to face future pandemics with smarter, science-based strategies.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Conducted by Penn State researchers, the 12-week clinical trial found that pistachio consumption increased beneficial gut microbes like Roseburia and reduced harmful ones such as Blautia hydrogenotrophica. These microbiome changes could potentially support metabolic health and slow the progression to Type 2 diabetes. While more research is needed to confirm health outcomes, this study positions pistachios as a promising late-night snack with microbiome-boosting potential.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
