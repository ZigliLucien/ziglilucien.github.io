href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-binary.html#essential-packages">essential
packages</a>, which provide the bare minimum functionality considered
absolutely necessary (or "essential") for a system to
function. Packages tagged as essential, and the packages that are
required by the set of essential packages, are always installed as
part of a Debian system. However, Debian's packaging rules do not
require developers to explicitly declare dependencies on that set of
packages (the essential set) but they can simply rely on the fact that those
will always be present. That means that changing the essential set, as
the project may wish to do occasionally, is more complicated than it
should be. This came to light recently when a Debian developer asked
what might be required to remove <a

Desktop from openSUSE due to violations of the project's packaging
policy.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The discovery of the bypass of the security whitelistings via the
<tt>deepin-feature-enable</tt> package marks a turning point in our assessment
of Deepin. We don't believe that the openSUSE Deepin packager acted
with bad intent when he implemented the "license agreement" dialog to
bypass our whitelisting restrictions. The dialog itself makes the
security concerns we have transparent, so this does not happen in a
sneaky way, at least not towards users. It was not discussed with us,
however, and it violates openSUSE packaging policies. Beyond the
security aspect, this also affects general packaging quality
assurance: the D-Bus configuration files and Polkit policies installed
by the <tt>deepin-feature-enable</tt> package are unknown to the package
manager and won't be cleaned up upon package removal, for
example. Such bypasses are not deemed acceptable by us.</p>

<p>The combination of these factors led us to the decision to remove
the Deepin desktop completely from openSUSE Tumbleweed and from the
future Leap 16.0 release. In openSUSE Leap 15.6 we will remove the
offending <tt>deepin-feature-enable</tt> package only. It is a difficult
decision given that the Deepin desktop has a considerable number of
users. We firmly believe the Deepin packaging and security assessment
in openSUSE needs a reboot, however, ideally involving new people that
can help get the Deepin packages into shape, establish a relationship
with Deepin upstream and keep an eye on bugfixes, thus avoiding
fruitless follow-up reviews that just waste our time. In such a new
setup we would be willing to have a look at all the sensitive Deepin
components again one by one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The announcement goes into detail about the bypass of
openSUSE packaging policy and the history of security reviews of
Deepin components. It also offers guidance on <a
href="https://security.opensuse.org/2025/05/07/deepin-desktop-removal.html#5-how-to-continue-using-deepin-on-opensuse">continuing

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote>In a combined filesystem and memory-management session at 
the 2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory
Management, and BPF Summit (LSFMM+BPF), Joanne Koong led a discussion on
improving the writeback performance for the <a
href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse?tab=readme-ov-file#libfuse">Filesystem in
Userspace</a> (FUSE) layer.  Writeback is how data that is written to the
filesystem is actually flushed to the disk; it is the process of writing
dirty pages from the page cache to storage.  The current FUSE
implementation allocates unmovable memory, then copies the dirty data to it
before initiating writeback, which is slow; Koong wanted to change that
behavior.  Since the session, she has <a
