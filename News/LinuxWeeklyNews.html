href="https://gitlab.com/jeffmahoney/opensuse-docs/-/blob/main/governance-draft.md">governance
proposal</a> for openSUSE, which was <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1056593/">published in January</a>,
is moving forward. The new structure would have three governance
bodies: a new technical steering committee (TSC), a community and 
marketing committee (CMC), as well as the existing openSUSE
board.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The discussions during the meeting proposed that the Technical
Steering Committee should begin with five members with a chair elected
by the committee. The group would establish clear processes for
reviewing and approving technical changes, drawing inspiration from
Fedora's FESCo model. Decisions for the TSC would use a voting system
of +1 to approve, 0 for neutral, or -1 to block. A proposal passes
without objection. A -1 vote would require a dedicated meeting, where
a majority of attendees would decide the outcome. Objections must
include a clear, documented rationale.</p>

<p>Discussions related to the Community and Marketing Committee would
focus on outreach, advocacy, and community growth. It could also serve
as an initial escalation point for disputes. If consensus cannot be
reached at that level, matters would advance to the Board.</p>

<p>[...] No timeline for final adoption was announced. Project
contributors will continue discussions through the GitLab repository
and future community meetings.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Last week, the Fedora Infrastructure Team <a
href="https://forge.fedoraproject.org/infra/tickets/issues/13135">lifted
the IP range block</a> on IP addresses in Syria. This action restores
download access to Fedora Linux deliverables, such as ISOs. It also
restores access from Syria to Fedora Linux RPM repositories, the
Fedora Account System, and Fedora build systems. Users can now access
the various applications and services that make up the Fedora
Project. This change follows a recent update to the Fedora Export
Control Policy. Today, anyone connecting to the public Internet from
Syria should once again be able to access Fedora.</p>

<p>[...] Opening the firewall to Syria took seconds. However, months of
conversations and hidden work occurred behind the scenes to make this
happen.</p>

progress report</a>.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	We've made incredible progress upstreaming patches over the past 12
	months. Our patch set has shrunk from 1232 patches with 6.13.8, to
	858 as of 6.18.8. Our total delta in terms of lines of code has
	also shrunk, from 95,000 lines to 83,000 lines for the same kernel
	versions. Hmm, a 15% reduction in lines of code for a 30% reduction
	in patches seems a bit wrong…
<p>
	Not all patches are created equal. Some of the upstreamed patches
	have been small fixes, others have been thousands of lines. All of
	them, however, pale in comparison to the GPU driver.
<p>
	The GPU driver is 21,000 lines by itself, discounting the
	downstream Rust abstractions we are still carrying. It is almost
	double the size of the DCP driver and thrice the size of the
	ISP/webcam driver, its two closest rivals. And upstreaming work has
	now begun.

<p>The crates.io team will no longer publish a blog post each time a

posts is generating noise, rather than signal.</p>

advisory when a crate is removed for containing malware. You can
subscribe to the <a href="https://rustsec.org/feed.xml">RustSec
advisory RSS feed</a> to receive updates.</p>

<p>Crates that contain malware and are seeing real usage or
