<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote><p>The Tor project has <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-oniux-tor-isolation-using-linux-namespaces/">announced</a>
the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/oniux#oniux">oniux</a> utility which provides Tor network isolation, using Linux
namespaces, for third-party applications.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Namespaces are a powerful feature that gives us the ability to
isolate Tor network access of an arbitrary application. We put each
application in a network namespace that doesn't provide access to
system-wide network interfaces (such as eth0), and instead provides a
custom network interface onion0.</p>

<p>This allows us to isolate an arbitrary application over Tor in the
most secure way possible software-wise, namely by relying on a
security primitive offered by the operating system kernel. Unlike
SOCKS, the application cannot accidentally leak data by failing to
make some connection via the configured SOCKS, which may happen due to
a mistake by the developer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Tor project cautions that oniux is considered experimental as
the software it depends on, such as <a
href="https://tpo.pages.torproject.net/core/arti/about">Arti</a> and
<a
href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/onionmasq#onionmasq---masquerading-onions">onionmasq</a>,
