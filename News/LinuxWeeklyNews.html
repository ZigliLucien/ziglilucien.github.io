called</a> for the NixOS project to use build-reproducibility to detect when a program has a maintainer-generated tarball that results in a different artifact than building from source. There are good reasons for projects to release maintainer-generated tarballs, but since the materials included in them are usually documentation, extra build scripts, and so on, it makes sense to check that they don't influence the final build output. While this would not have stopped

</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
People are often convinced that OSS is more trustworthy than closed-source software because the code can be audited by practitioners and security professionals in order to detect vulnerabilities or backdoors. In this instance, this procedure has been made difficult by the fact that part of the code activating the backdoor was not included in the sources available within the git repository but was instead present in the maintainer-provided tarball. While this was used to hide the backdoor out of sight of most investigating eyes, this is also an opportunity for us to improve our software supply chain security processes.

Brendan Jackman has been working to try to get ahead of the next hardware CPU

before it gets discovered. In January, he posted the second version of
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250110-asi-rfc-v2-v2-0-8419288bc805@google.com/">
a patch set</a> that introduces
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/974390/">
address-space isolation</a> (ASI) as a way of
preventing future CPU vulnerabilities from leaking important
information. The core concept is to ensure that data that is not currently
needed is not present in memory, so that speculative execution cannot leak it.
The work is nowhere near ready to be incorporated into the mainline
kernel — not least of all because it has a large performance impact in its
current form — but it is likely to once again be a topic of discussion at the
2025
