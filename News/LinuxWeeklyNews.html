reference implementation of a <a

release comes with a new shell that can be programmed using the <a

renderer, smoother media playback, color-management additions, and more.

<blockquote class="bq">
One of Weston's fundamental pillars has always been making the most efficient use of display hardware. Over time, all the work we did to track and offload as much work as possible to this efficient fixed-function hardware has come at the cost of eating CPU time. In the last couple of release cycles, we've focused really hard on improving performance on even the most low-end of devices, so not only do we make the most efficient use of the GPU and display hardware, but we're also really kind on your CPU now. As part of that and to improve our tooling, Weston 15 now comes with support for the <a href="https://perfetto.dev/">Perfetto</a> profiler.

	When we originally evaluated Rust back in 2024, we rejected it
	because it's not great at C++ style OOP. The web platform object

	deep inheritance hierarchies, and so on. Rust's ownership model is
	not a natural fit for that.
<p>
	But after another year of treading water, it's time to make the
	pragmatic choice. Rust has the ecosystem and the safety guarantees
	we need. Both Firefox and Chromium have already begun introducing
	Rust into their codebases, and we think it's the right choice for

added</a> that
the "<q>vast majority</q>" of users would not have to. That reassurance has to
contend with the fact that the UK and other countries are implementing
increasingly strict age requirements for social media. Discord's age
verification would be done with an AI age-judging
model or with a government photo ID. A surprising number of open-source
projects use Discord for support or project communications, and some of those
projects are now looking for open-source alternatives. Mastodon, for example,
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/116041405748460511">

with their own pros and cons, that communities may want to consider if they want
to switch away from Discord.

proposal</a> for openSUSE, which was <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1056593/">published in January</a>,
is moving forward. The new structure would have three governance
bodies: a new technical steering committee (TSC), a community and 
marketing committee (CMC), as well as the existing openSUSE
board.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The discussions during the meeting proposed that the Technical
Steering Committee should begin with five members with a chair elected
by the committee. The group would establish clear processes for
reviewing and approving technical changes, drawing inspiration from
Fedora's FESCo model. Decisions for the TSC would use a voting system
of +1 to approve, 0 for neutral, or -1 to block. A proposal passes
without objection. A -1 vote would require a dedicated meeting, where
a majority of attendees would decide the outcome. Objections must
include a clear, documented rationale.</p>

<p>Discussions related to the Community and Marketing Committee would
focus on outreach, advocacy, and community growth. It could also serve
as an initial escalation point for disputes. If consensus cannot be
reached at that level, matters would advance to the Board.</p>

<p>[...] No timeline for final adoption was announced. Project
contributors will continue discussions through the GitLab repository
and future community meetings.</p>
