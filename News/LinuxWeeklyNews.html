the long journey</a> to fixing a bug in the <a
href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDebi">GDebi</a> utility for
installing Debian packages. He first encountered the bug in
Ubuntu&nbsp;MATE&nbsp;18.04: "<q>at the time I just ignored this
issue. I didn't want to deal with it. I went off to the trusty Linux
terminal and installed Chrome that way instead</q>".</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Two and a half years ago, I committed to doing more open-source
contributions in my free time and was finally irritated enough about
this problem to look into it. I searched around for more info. Lo and
behold, <a

affected</a> and <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdebi/+bug/1854588">there was already an
issue from 2019 on Ubuntu's bug tracker</a> about it.</p>

<p>[...] As is commonly the case in software development, the difficult part of
this fix had nothing to do with the code itself. All of my effort was
spent figuring out Ubuntu's patch submission processes and advocating
for my merge request. Nobody else seemed to be interested in doing the
work to actually fix this bug that has been plaguing Ubuntu MATE and
Xubuntu, not to mention some Debian users, for over 6 years. After
dealing with the long process of getting my merge request approved, I
think I'm starting to understand why!

and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/iot/">Fedora IoT</a> systems installed
before Fedora&nbsp;40 may fail to boot after an update if secure boot
is enabled. Fedora Magazine has <a
href="https://fedoramagazine.org/manual-action-needed-to-resolve-boot-failure-for-fedora-atomic-desktops-and-fedora-iot/">a
post</a> by Timothée Ravier about the problem, how users can work
around it, and what the project is doing to avoid the similar problems
in the future:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>On Fedora Atomic Desktops and Fedora IoT systems, the components
that are part of the boot chain (Shim, GRUB) are not (yet)
automatically updated alongside the rest of the system. Thus, if you
have installed a Fedora Atomic Desktop or a Fedora IoT system before
Fedora 40, it uses an old versions of the Shim and bootloader binaries
to boot your system.</p>

<p>When Secure Boot is enabled, the EFI firmware loads Shim
first. Shim is signed by the Microsoft Third Party Certificate
Authority so that it can be verified on most hardware out of the
box. The Shim binary includes the Fedora certificates used to verify
binaries signed by Fedora. Then Shim loads GRUB, which in turn loads
the Linux kernel. Both are signed by Fedora.</p>

<p>Until recently, the kernel binaries where signed two times, with an
older key and a newer one. With the 6.9 kernel update, the kernel is
no longer signed with the old key. If GRUB or Shim is old enough and
does not know about the new key, the signature verification fails.</p>

The

protocol is similar to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec">
IPsec</a>, in that it allows for wrapping arbitrary traffic

have to track in order to send and receive encrypted traffic, allowing for more
simultaneous connections. Jakub Kicinski

In broad strokes, OpenType added support for <i>color fonts</i>, <i>variable fonts</i>, and the <i>Universal Shaping Engine</i>.

The Open Source text stack also gained enormous market-share when Android and Google Chrome fully embraced it.
<p>
Looking forward, there is a <i>Rust</i> migration of the text stack underway, which will unify font compilation and consumption under a safe programming language. <i>Incremental Font Transfer</i> will enable streaming fonts to web browsers.
