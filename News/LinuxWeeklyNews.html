Kangrejos 2024</a> started off with a talk from Benno Lossin about his
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/982868/">recent work</a>
to establish a standard for safety documentation in Rust kernel code. Lossin
began his talk by giving a brief review of what safety documentation is, and
why it's needed, before moving on to the current status of his work. Safety
documentation is easier to read and write when there's a shared vocabulary for
discussing common requirements; Lossin wants to establish that shared vocabulary
for Rust code in the Linux kernel.

Four researchers have <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1421.pdf">published</a> a formal proof that Linux's new deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) is secure in a particular sense — specifically, that the number of queries that would need to be made to it to uncover its internal state depends on the quality of the entropy it can collect from different sources. As long as it can gather enough entropy, it produces secure random numbers.
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Since the significant structural changes in Linux 4 and Linux 5.17, there has
been no research on the provable security of Linux-DRBG. For the first time (to
the best of our knowledge), we formally model the Linux-DRBG in Linux 6.4.8
and prove its security in the seedless robustness model
