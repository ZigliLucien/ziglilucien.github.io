a blog post explaining that Google has revoked a critical permission
from the Nextcloud Files app for Android that allows it to sync files
to Nextcloud Hub.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Google is stating security concerns as a reason for revoking the
permission. This is hard to believe for us. Nextcloud has had this
feature since its inception in 2016, and we have never heard about any
security concerns from Google about it. Moreover, several Big Tech
apps as well as Google's own still have this. What we think: Google
owning the platform means they can and are giving themselves
preferential treatment.</p>

<p>Despite multiple appeals since mid-2024, Google has refused to
reinstate the permission, blocking automated Nextcloud file uploads
for millions of users.</p>

<p>So, our big focus this next year is locking in ongoing support –
think annualized pledges, different kinds of regular income, and other
recurring help. This is vital, especially with potential new data
center costs and hardware needs. Getting this right means we can stop
worrying about short-term funding and plan for the future: investing
in our tech and people, growing our awesome student programs, and
serving the FOSS community. We're looking for partners, big and small,

<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Asynchronous I/O delivers the most noticeable gains in cloud
	environments where storage is network-attached, such as Amazon EBS
	volumes. In these setups, individual disk reads often take multiple
	milliseconds, introducing substantial latency compared to local
	SSDs.
<p>
	With traditional synchronous I/O, each of these reads blocks query
	execution until the data arrives, leading to idle CPU time and
	degraded throughput. By contrast, asynchronous I/O allows Postgres
	to issue multiple read requests in parallel and continue processing
	while waiting for results. This reduces query latency and enables
	much more efficient use of available I/O bandwidth and CPU cycles.
