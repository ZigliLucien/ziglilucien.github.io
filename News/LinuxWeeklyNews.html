to exfiltrate any files your Unix user has access to.

was reached. <a

The BPF verifier is not magic; it cannot solve the

cannot prove that the program will not.
The ultimate check on the size of a BPF program is the
one-million-instruction limit — the verifier will refuse to process more than
one-million instructions, no matter what a BPF program does. Alexei Starovoitov gave
a talk at the 2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management, and BPF Summit about that limit,
why correctly written BPF programs shouldn't hit it, and how to make the user
experience of large BPF programs better in the future.
