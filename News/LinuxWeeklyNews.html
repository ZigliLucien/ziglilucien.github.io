BPF programs are loaded directly into the kernel.
Even though the verifier protects the kernel from certain kinds of
misbehavior in BPF programs, some people are still justifiably concerned about
adding unsigned code to their kernel. A fully correct BPF program can still be
used to expose sensitive data, for example.
To remedy this, Blaise Boscaccy and KP Singh
have both shared patch sets that add ways to verify cryptographic
signatures of BPF programs, allowing users to configure their kernels to load
only pre-approved BPF programs. This work follows on from the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1017549/">
discussion</a> at the
Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management, and BPF Summit (LSFMM+BPF)

There are
still some fundamental disagreements over the best approach to signing BPF
programs, however.

vendors that use the service to help fund its development and maintenance
going forward.

<blockquote class="bq">
The Linux Foundation is kindly paying for all the hosting costs of the LVFS, and Red Hat pays for all my time ‚Äî but as LVFS grows and grows that's going to be less and less sustainable longer term. We're trying to find funding to hire additional resources as a "me replacement" so that there is backup and additional attention to LVFS (and so that I can go on holiday for two weeks without needing to take a laptop with me).
<p>
This year there will be a fair-use quota introduced, with different sponsorship levels having a different quota allowance. Nothing currently happens if the quota is exceeded, although there will be additional warnings asking the vendor to contribute. The "associate" (free) quota is also generous, with 50,000 monthly downloads and 50 monthly uploads. This means that almost all the 140 vendors on the LVFS should expect no changes.

("trixie"), which will be supported through 2030. This release
includes GNOME&#160;48, KDE&#160;Plasma&#160;6.3, Xfce&#160;4.20,
Linux&#160;6.12, GCC&#160;14.2, Python&#160;3.13, and
systemd&#160;257.

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>This release contains over 14,100 new packages for a total count of
69,830 packages, while over 8,840 packages have been removed as
"obsolete". 44,326 packages were updated in this release. The overall
disk usage for "trixie" is 403,854,660 kB (403 GB), and is made up of
1,463,291,186 lines of code. [...]</p>

<p>With this broad selection of packages and its traditional wide
architecture support, Debian once again stays true to its goal of
being "<em>The Universal Operating System</em>". It is suitable for many
different use cases: from desktop systems to netbooks; from
development servers to cluster systems; and for database, web, and
storage servers. At the same time, additional quality assurance
efforts like automatic installation and upgrade tests for all packages
in Debian's archive ensure that "<em>trixie</em>" fulfills the high
expectations that users have of a stable Debian release.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trixie adds riscv64 as an officially supported architecture, and
drops i386 as a regular architecture. Users with i386 systems should
not upgrade to trixie; the project recommends reinstalling them as
amd64, or retiring the hardware. See the <a
