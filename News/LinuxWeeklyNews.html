this lack by creating
<a href="https://github.com/MatheuZSecurity/Singularity?tab=readme-ov-file#singularity---poc-of-stealthy-linux-kernel-rootkit">
an open-source rootkit called Singularity</a> for Linux systems. Users who feel
their computers are too secure can install the Singularity kernel module in
order to allow remote code execution, disable security features, and hide files
and processes from normal administrative tools. Despite its many features,
Singularity is not currently known to be in use in the wild — instead, it
provides security researchers with a testbed to investigate new detection and
evasion techniques.

href="https://projectzero.google/2026/01/pixel-0-click-part-1.html">a
three-part series</a> describing a working, zero-click exploit for
Pixel&#160;9 devices.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Over the past few years, several AI-powered features have been
	added to mobile phones that allow users to better search and
	understand their messages. One effect of this change is increased
	0-click attack surface, as efficient analysis often requires
	message media to be decoded before the message is opened by the
	user. One such feature is audio transcription. Incoming SMS and RCS
	audio attachments received by Google Messages are now automatically
	decoded with no user interaction. As a result, audio decoders are
	now in the 0-click attack surface of most Android phones.
</blockquote>
<p>
The blog entry does not question the wisdom of directly exposing audio
decoders to external attackers, but it does provide a lot of detail showing
how it can go wrong.  The first part looks at compromising the codec; <a
href="https://projectzero.google/2026/01/pixel-0-click-part-2.html">part
two</a> extends the exploit to the kernel, and <a
href="https://projectzero.google/2026/01/pixel-0-click-part-3.html">part
three</a> looks at the implications:
<P>
<blockquote class="bq">
	It is alarming that it took 139 days for a vulnerability
	exploitable in a 0-click context to get patched on any Android
	device, and it took Pixel 54 days longer. The vulnerability was
	public for 82 days before it was patched by Pixel.

href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/statements/state-of-openssl/">strongly
worded criticism</a> of <a href="https://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>. It
comes from a talk they gave at the <a href="https://2025.openssl-conference.org/">OpenSSL conference</a> in October 2025 (<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUIguklWwx0">YouTube video</a>).  The
post goes into a lot of detail about the problems with the OpenSSL code
base and testing, which has led the <tt>cryptography</tt> team to
reconsider using the library. "<q>The mistakes we see in OpenSSL's
development have become so significant that we believe substantial changes
are required — either to OpenSSL, or to our reliance on it.</q>"  They go
further in the conclusion:

<blockquote class="bq">
First, we will no longer require OpenSSL implementations for new functionality. Where we deem it desirable, we will add new APIs that are only on LibreSSL/BoringSSL/AWS-LC. Concretely, we expect to add ML-KEM and ML-DSA APIs that are only available with LibreSSL/BoringSSL/AWS-LC, and not with OpenSSL.
<p>
Second, we currently statically link a copy of OpenSSL in our wheels (binary artifacts). We are beginning the process of looking into what would be required to change our wheels to link against one of the OpenSSL forks.
<p>
If we are able to successfully switch to one of OpenSSL's forks for our binary wheels, we will begin considering the circumstances under which we would drop support for OpenSSL entirely.
