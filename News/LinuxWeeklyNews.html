<blockquote class="bq">
We introduced a new BSD makefile, located at <a

writing, we only support building and installing Rust
applications. Supporting library crates is planned (we would like to
be able to build/install library crates that expose an FFI, like for
<span class="nobreak">C/C++ compatibility</span>). Normal library crates build and install just
fine. Support for cdylib Rust library crates specifically is what's
missing, but is desired and planned.</p>

<p>We do NOT currently support Rust in the kernel. Kernel support
requires more work that we deemed out-of-scope for this initial
proof-of-concept/work-in-progress patchset. We also do NOT support
building multiple programs in the same BSD Makefile (like with
bsd.progs.mk), though that is also a desired feature.</p>

changes. Nevertheless, many users still felt the response was
inadequate. Some previous Setuptools releases have also caused problems on a smaller but still notable scale, and hopefully the developers will be more cautious going forward. But there are also lessons here for the developers of Python package installers, ordinary Python developers and end users, and even Linux distribution maintainers.

cgo-based Go+BoringCrypto integration, which provides a FIPS 140-2
compliant cryptography mode for internal usage at Google. The
Go+BoringCrypto code is not supported by the Go team for external use,
but has been critical for Google's internal usage of Go.</p>

<p>The Trail of Bits team found one vulnerability and <a
href="https://go.dev/cl/644120">one non-security relevant bug</a>,
both of which were results of the manual memory management required to
interact with a C library. Since the Go team does not support usage of
this code outside of Google, we have chosen not to issue a CVE or Go
vulnerability database entry for this issue, but we <a
href="https://go.dev/cl/644119">fixed it in the Go 1.25 development
tree</a>.</p>
