The closed-source chat platform Discord
<a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally">
announced</a> on February&#160;9 that it would soon require some users to verify their
ages in order to access some content — although the company quickly
<a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally#age-assurance-clarification">
added</a> that
the "<q>vast majority</q>" of users would not have to. That reassurance has to
contend with the fact that the UK and other countries are implementing
increasingly strict age requirements for social media. Discord's age
verification would be done with an AI age-judging
model or with a government photo ID. A surprising number of open-source
projects use Discord for support or project communications, and some of those
projects are now looking for open-source alternatives. Mastodon, for example,
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/116041405748460511">
has moved discussion to Zulip</a>. There are some alternatives out there, all
with their own pros and cons, that communities may want to consider if they want
to switch away from Discord.

proposal</a> for openSUSE, which was <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1056593/">published in January</a>,
is moving forward. The new structure would have three governance
bodies: a new technical steering committee (TSC), a community and 
marketing committee (CMC), as well as the existing openSUSE
board.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The discussions during the meeting proposed that the Technical
Steering Committee should begin with five members with a chair elected
by the committee. The group would establish clear processes for
reviewing and approving technical changes, drawing inspiration from
Fedora's FESCo model. Decisions for the TSC would use a voting system
of +1 to approve, 0 for neutral, or -1 to block. A proposal passes
without objection. A -1 vote would require a dedicated meeting, where
a majority of attendees would decide the outcome. Objections must
include a clear, documented rationale.</p>

<p>Discussions related to the Community and Marketing Committee would
focus on outreach, advocacy, and community growth. It could also serve
as an initial escalation point for disputes. If consensus cannot be
reached at that level, matters would advance to the Board.</p>

<p>[...] No timeline for final adoption was announced. Project
contributors will continue discussions through the GitLab repository
and future community meetings.</p>

<p>Last week, the Fedora Infrastructure Team <a
href="https://forge.fedoraproject.org/infra/tickets/issues/13135">lifted
the IP range block</a> on IP addresses in Syria. This action restores
download access to Fedora Linux deliverables, such as ISOs. It also
restores access from Syria to Fedora Linux RPM repositories, the
Fedora Account System, and Fedora build systems. Users can now access
the various applications and services that make up the Fedora
Project. This change follows a recent update to the Fedora Export
Control Policy. Today, anyone connecting to the public Internet from
Syria should once again be able to access Fedora.</p>

<p>[...] Opening the firewall to Syria took seconds. However, months of
conversations and hidden work occurred behind the scenes to make this
happen.</p>

progress report</a>.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	We've made incredible progress upstreaming patches over the past 12
	months. Our patch set has shrunk from 1232 patches with 6.13.8, to
	858 as of 6.18.8. Our total delta in terms of lines of code has
	also shrunk, from 95,000 lines to 83,000 lines for the same kernel
	versions. Hmm, a 15% reduction in lines of code for a 30% reduction
	in patches seems a bit wrong…
<p>
	Not all patches are created equal. Some of the upstreamed patches
	have been small fixes, others have been thousands of lines. All of
	them, however, pale in comparison to the GPU driver.
<p>
	The GPU driver is 21,000 lines by itself, discounting the
	downstream Rust abstractions we are still carrying. It is almost
	double the size of the DCP driver and thrice the size of the
	ISP/webcam driver, its two closest rivals. And upstreaming work has
	now begun.

6.6.0</a> of KDE's Plasma desktop environment has been
released. Notable additions in this release include the ability to
create global themes for Plasma, an "extract text" feature in the <a

<p>The release is dedicated to the memory of Björn Balazs, a KDE
contributor who passed away in September 2025. "<q>Björn's drive to
help people achieve the privacy and control over technology that he
believed they deserved is the stuff FLOSS legends are made of.</q>"</p>
