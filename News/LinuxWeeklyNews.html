update</a> to the effect that, since Git repositories have become the
preferred method to distribute source, that is how Debian should be
distributing its source packages.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
<b>Everyone who interacts with Debian source code should be able to
do so entirely in git.</b>
<p>	
That means, more specifically:
<ol class="spacylist">
<li>    All examination and edits to the source should be performed via
normal git operations. 

<li> Source code should be transferred and exchanged as git data, not
tarballs. git should be the canonical form everywhere.

<li> Upstream git histories should be re-published, traceably, as part of
formal git releases published by Debian.

<li> No-one should have to learn about Debian Source Packages, which are
bizarre, and have been obsoleted by modern version control.
</ol>
<p>
This is very ambitious, but we have come a long way!

struggle with and one that her employer, Google, gained a lot of experience
with from its now-concluded <a

$750,000 to the project in 2025 and has made progress on graphics
drivers, Wi-Fi&#160;4 and 5 support, audio improvements, sleep states,
and more.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The installer for FreeBSD has gained a couple of new features that
benefit laptop users. In 15.0 the installer now supports downloading
and installing firmware packages after the FreeBSD base system
installation is complete. Coming in 15.1 it will be possible to
install the KDE graphical desktop environment during the installation
process. Grateful thanks to Bjoern Zeeb and Alfonso Siciliano
respectively. [...]</p>

<p>The project continues into 2026 with a similar sized investment and
scope. Key targets include completing work on sleep states (modern
standby and hibernate), adding support for graphics drivers up to
Linux 6.18, Wi-Fi 6 support, USB4 and Thunderbolt support, HDMI
improvements, UVC webcam support, and Bluetooth improvements.</p>

<p>A substantial testing program will also start in January, aiming to
test all the functionality together across a range of
hardware. Community testers are very welcome to help out, the
Foundation will release a blog post and send an invite to help to the
Desktop mailing list some time in January 2026.</p>

The BPF verifier is complicated. It needs to

BPF program is safe is based on the whole lifetime of the program, instead of
