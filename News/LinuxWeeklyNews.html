Let's Encrypt has
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/07/23/replacing-ocsp-with-crls.html">announced</a>
that it intends to end support "<q>as soon as possible</q>" for the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">
Online Certificate Status Protocol</a> (OCSP) over privacy concerns. OCSP was developed as a
lighter-weight alternative to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list">
Certificate Revocation Lists</a> (CRLs) that did not involve downloading
the entire CRL in order to check whether a certificate was valid. Let's Encrypt will continue
supporting OCSP as long as it is a requirement for Microsoft's
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/program-requirements">
Trusted Root Program</a>, but hopes to discontinue it soon:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
We plan to end support for OCSP primarily because it represents a considerable risk to privacy on the Internet. When someone visits a website using a browser or other software that checks for certificate revocation via OCSP, the Certificate Authority (CA) operating the OCSP responder immediately becomes aware of which website is being visited from that visitor's particular IP address. Even when a CA intentionally does not retain this information, as is the case with Let's Encrypt, CAs could be legally compelled to collect it. CRLs do not have this issue.
</blockquote>

<p>
People using Let's Encrypt as their CA should, for the most part, not need to change their setups.
All modern browsers support CRLs, so end-users shouldn't notice an impact either.

an article</a> announcing some new releases of the Llama large language
model and going on at length about why open-source models are important:
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	AI has more potential than any other modern technology to increase
	human productivity, creativity, and quality of life – and to
	accelerate economic growth while unlocking progress in medical and
	scientific research. Open source will ensure that more people
	around the world have access to the benefits and opportunities of
	AI, that power isn't concentrated in the hands of a small number of
	companies, and that the technology can be deployed more evenly and
	safely across society.
<p>
	There is an ongoing debate about the safety of open source AI
	models, and my view is that open source AI will be safer than the
	alternatives. I think governments will conclude it's in their
	interest to support open source because it will make the world more
	prosperous and safer.
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, whether Llama is truly open source is debatable at best, but it
is more open than many of the alternatives.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
