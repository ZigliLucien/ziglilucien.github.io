about the <a
href="https://discourse.flathub.org/t/upcoming-freedesktop-23-08-runtime-release-will-drop-openh264-extension/9022">announcement</a>
that the Freedesktop project is dropping OpenH264 from the <a
href="https://freedesktop-sdk.io/">Freedesktop SDK</a> for Flatpak
applications and runtimes.</p>

<p>Some Flatpak applications that depend on the Freedesktop runtime
version 23.08 will lose H.264 playback support starting with the
release scheduled for April, unless application developers replace it
with the <tt>ffmpeg-full</tt> extension. The 24.08 runtime is
unaffected, and future releases will include a new
<tt>codecs-extra</tt> extension to replace OpenH264 that includes <a
href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> with support for a number of
patented codecs.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Considering all things, I think and hope we made the correct decision
and hopefully the new <tt>org.freedesktop.Platform.codecs-extra</tt> works
out. libx264, libx265 and others are built from source and there are
no binaries or extra-data involved. So we should theoretically be able
to patch and fix any issues that come up in the future.</p>

<p>Apart from all this, I'm slightly worried at the prospects of legal
issues cropping up with this setup and also that the new extension
contains "too much", but we will have to see where things flow.</p>

People are often convinced that OSS is more trustworthy than closed-source software because the code can be audited by practitioners and security professionals in order to detect vulnerabilities or backdoors. In this instance, this procedure has been made difficult by the fact that part of the code activating the backdoor was not included in the sources available within the git repository but was instead present in the maintainer-provided tarball. While this was used to hide the backdoor out of sight of most investigating eyes, this is also an opportunity for us to improve our software supply chain security processes.
