Pahole (originally "Poke-a-hole") is a Swiss Army knife for exploring and
editing debug information. Pahole is also currently involved
in the kernel's build process to rearrange the information
produced by various compilers into a form useful to the BPF verifier, although
there are plans to render it unnecessary.
Pahole maintainer Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo shared some status
updates about the project at the 2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management, and BPF summit. Interested readers can find his slides
<a href="http://vger.kernel.org/~acme/prez/lsfmm-bpf-2025/">here</a>.

<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	We are all struggling with a massive shift that has happened in the
	past 10 or 20 years in the software industry. For decades, software
	reuse was only a lofty goal. Now it's very real. Modern
	programming environments such as Go, Node, and Rust have made it
	trivial to reuse work by others, but our instincts about
	responsible behaviors have not yet adapted to this new reality.
<p>
	The fact that the 1974 Multics review anticipated many of the
	problems we face today is evidence that these problems are
	fundamental and have no easy answers. We must work to make
	continuous improvements to open source software supply chain
	security, making attacks more and more difficult and expensive.

an additional layer of indirection in the kernel's swap map; the third,
