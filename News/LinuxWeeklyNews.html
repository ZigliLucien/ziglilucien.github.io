with many users. More and more applications are being published in the

from the Nextcloud Files app for Android that allows it to sync files
to Nextcloud Hub.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Google is stating security concerns as a reason for revoking the
permission. This is hard to believe for us. Nextcloud has had this
feature since its inception in 2016, and we have never heard about any
security concerns from Google about it. Moreover, several Big Tech
apps as well as Google's own still have this. What we think: Google
owning the platform means they can and are giving themselves
preferential treatment.</p>

<p>Despite multiple appeals since mid-2024, Google has refused to
reinstate the permission, blocking automated Nextcloud file uploads
for millions of users.</p>

href="https://osuosl.org/blog/osl-future-update/">writes</a> that the
Oregon State University Open Source Lab has been funded for the next
year, following his <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1019520/">announcement</a> in April
that the future of OSL was in jeopardy. OSL is now focusing on
becoming self-sustainable long term.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The recent support was amazing for our immediate team needs. But
for the OSL to thrive long-term, we need a sustainable financial
foundation. This is crucial, as the university expects units like ours
to become self-sufficient beyond this current year.</p>

<p>So, our big focus this next year is locking in ongoing support –
think annualized pledges, different kinds of regular income, and other
recurring help. This is vital, especially with potential new data
center costs and hardware needs. Getting this right means we can stop
worrying about short-term funding and plan for the future: investing
in our tech and people, growing our awesome student programs, and
serving the FOSS community. We're looking for partners, big and small,
who get why foundational open source infrastructure matters and want
to help us build this sustainable future together.</p>
