	I paid good money for my 24 CPU cores, but ./configure can only
	manage to use 69% of one of them. As a result, this random project
	takes about 13.5× longer to <i>configure</i> the build than it does to

	<p>
	The purpose of a ./configure script is basically to run the
	compiler a bunch of times and check which runs succeeded. In this
	way it can test whether particular headers, functions, struct
	fields, etc. exist, which lets people write portable software. This
	is an embarrassingly parallel problem, but Autoconf can't

the election and results in March. The update commits to improvements

<blockquote class="bq">
What this election exposed was the need for the organization to also
assess whether candidates were fully eligible to run and prepared to
be seated on the board before voting begins. This is something we will
add to the election timeline next year. While we have not finished
figuring out all of the requirements for that assessment, part of it
will be asking candidates to sign a Candidate Agreement at nomination
time. We also have some ideas on ways for potential candidates to have
more information even before submitting a nomination.
