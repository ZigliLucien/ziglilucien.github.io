A few years ago, the only way to compile Rust code was using the rustc compiler
with LLVM as a backend. Since then, several projects, including
<a href="https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc?tab=readme-ov-file#mutabahs-rust-compiler">
Mutabah's Rust Compiler</a> (mrustc), <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1040197/">GCC's Rust
support</a> (gccrs),
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/907405/#rust_codegen_gcc">
rust_codegen_gcc</a>, and
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/964735/">
Cranelift</a> have made enormous progress
on diversifying Rust's compiler implementations. The most recent such project,
<a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/eurydice?tab=readme-ov-file#eurydice">
Eurydice</a>, has a
more ambitious goal: converting Rust code to clean C code. This is especially
useful in high-assurance software, where existing verification and compliance
tools expect C. Until such tools can be updated to work with Rust, Eurydice could
provide a smoother transition for these projects, as well as a stepping-stone
for environments that have a C compiler but no working Rust compiler. Eurydice
has been used to compile some post-quantum-cryptography routines from Rust to C,
for example.

that it will not be holding the 2026 spring board election. Instead,
it will be creating a working group to "<q>review and improve OSI's
board member selection process</q>" and provide recommendations by
September&#160;2026:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The public election process was designed to gather community
priorities and improve board member selection, while final
appointments remained with the board.</p>

<p>Over time, that nuance has become a source of understandable
confusion for community members. Many reasonably expected elections to
function as elections normally do, and in fact, the board has
generally adopted the electorate's recommendations. When a process
feels unclear, trust suffers. When trust suffers, engagement becomes
harder. This is especially problematic for an organization whose
mission depends on legitimacy and credibility. [...]</p>

<p>OSI tried its experiment for the right reasons, but a variety of
factors resulted in "elections" that are performatively democratic
while being gameable and representative of only a small group, and
we've learned from the results. Now we are making space to align our
director selection process with our bylaws, to rebuild trust, and to
develop better, more durable and truly representative participation in
which the global stakeholder community can be heard.</p>
