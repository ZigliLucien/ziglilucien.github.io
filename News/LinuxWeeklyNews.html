transfers, though; that means Rust drivers will need a set of

abstractions have run into resistance that has the potential to block

<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/">GitLab instance</a> are currently being greeted with a message noting that
the company who has been hosting it for free for nearly five years, Equinix, has
asked that it be moved (or start being paid for) by the end of April.  The
<a
href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freedesktop/freedesktop/-/issues/2011">issue
ticket</a> opened by Benjamin Tissoires in order to  track the planning of a move is clear that the project is grateful for
the gift:
"<q>First, I'd like to thank Equinix Metal for the years of support they gave us. They were very kind and generous with us and even if it's a shame we have to move out on a short notice, all things come to an end.</q>"

<p>
The current cost for the services, much of which is for 50TB of <strike>bandwidth</strike> data transfer
per month and a half-dozen beefy servers for running continuous-integration
(CI) jobs, comes to around $24,000 per month.  Tissoires believes that the
project should start paying for service somewhere, in order to avoid
upheaval of this sort, sometimes on short or no notice. "<q>I personally
think we better have fd.o pay for its own servers, and then have sponsors
chip in. This way, when a sponsor goes away, it's technically much simpler
to just replace the money than change datacenter.</q>"  Various options are
being discussed there, but any move is likely to disrupt normal services
for a week or more.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Security researcher RyotaK
<a href="https://flatt.tech/research/posts/clone2leak-your-git-credentials-belong-to-us/">
has shared</a> a series of vulnerabilities that all have to do with how Git
interfaces with external
credential managers. In short, while Git guards against newline characters
(<tt>\n</tt>) being injected into a repository's URL, some programming languages
also treat carriage return characters (<tt>\r</tt>) as being newlines. Adding a
carriage return to a repository's URL can cause Git and the credential manager
to disagree on how the URL should be parsed, ultimately resulting in Git
credentials being sent to the wrong host. Malicious repositories could include
Git submodules with malformed URLs, triggering the bug. Only password-based authentication
with an external credential manager is
vulnerable to this attack; SSH-based authentication remains secure. The Git project
has chosen to consider this a vulnerability in Git, given the large amount of
external software affected. The project has fixed the bug on its end by
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.48.1.txt">
releasing updates</a> for all supported versions that ban
carriage returns in URLs entirely.
</p>

<p>
Affected software includes GitHub Desktop, Git LFS, and possibly other Git utilities:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
Since Git itself doesn't use .lfsconfig file, specifying the URL that contains
the newline character in .lfsconfig causes Git LFS to insert the newline character
into the message, while bypassing [...] Git's validation.
