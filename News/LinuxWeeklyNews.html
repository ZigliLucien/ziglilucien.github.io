3.0</a> of the <a href="https://offpunk.net/">Offpunk</a>
offline-first, command-line web, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)">Gemini</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">Gopher</a>
browser has been released. Notable changes in this release include
integration of the <a
href="https://codeberg.org/vjousse/unmerdify#unmerdif">unmerdify</a>
library to "<q>remove cruft</q>" from web sites, the <tt>xkcdpunk</tt>
standalone tool for viewing <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>
comics in the terminal, and a <tt>cookies</tt> command to enable
browsing web sites (such as LWN.net) while being logged in.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Something wonderful happened on the road leading to 3.0: Offpunk
became a true cooperative effort. Offpunk 3.0 is probably the first
release that contains code I didn't review line-by-line. Unmerdify (by
Vincent Jousse), all the translation infrastructure (by the
always-present JMCS), and the community packaging effort are areas for
which I barely touched the code.</p>

<p>So, before anything else, I want to thank all the people involved
for sharing their energy and motivation. I'm very grateful for every
contribution the project received. I'm also really happy to see "old
names" replying from time to time on the mailing list. It makes me
feel like there's an emerging Offpunk community where everybody can
contribute at their own pace.</p>

<p>There were a lot of changes between 2.8 and 3.0, which probably
means some new bugs and some regressions. We count on you, yes, you!,
to report them and make 3.1 a lot more stable. It's as easy at typing
"bugreport" in offpunk!</p>

<p>During the beta we encountered only a few significant bugs.  Now that
we've fixed those, our rate of successful uploads is hovering around
95%. Failures are almost always due to packaging inconsistencies that
older workflows don't detect, and therefore only need fixing once per
package.</p>

<p>We don't think you need explicit approval from your co-maintainers
anymore.  Your upload workflows can be different to your teammates.
They can be using dput, dgit or tag2upload.</p>

	What is the goal of using ML models in Linux kernel? The main goal

	subsystem configuration based on internal state of subsystem. As a
	result, it needs: (1) collect data for training, (2) execute ML
	model training phase, (3) test trained ML model, (4) use ML model
	for executing the inference phase.  The ML model inference can be
	used for recommendation of Linux kernel subsystem configuration
	or/and for injecting a synthesized subsystem logic into kernel
	space (for example, eBPF logic).

This is a major release for the project, seeing several substantive new features that users have asked for over a long period of time.

<p>
We expect to get feedback on some of the major new features in this release, and plan to take that into account as we improve and refine them and the rest of Ardour going forward. We have no doubt that there will be both delight and disappointment with certain things - rather than assume that we don't know what we're doing, please leave us feedback on <a href="https://discourse.ardour.org/">the forums</a> so that Ardour gets better over time. Those of you new to our clip launching implementation might care to read up on <a href="https://ardour.org/clip_differences.html">the differences with Ableton Live</a>.

In the coming weeks, we'll begin to sketch out what we have planned next for Ardour, in addition to responding to the feedback we get on this 9.0 release.

Control-flow integrity (CFI) is a set of techniques that make it more difficult for
attackers to hijack indirect jumps to exploit a system. The Linux kernel has
supported forward-edge CFI (which protects indirect function calls)

of the feature introduced <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/898040">in 2022</a>. That
version avoids the overhead introduced by the earlier approach by using a
compiler flag (<tt>-fsanitize=kcfi</tt>) that is present in Clang but not in
GCC. Now, Kees Cook has

<div id="linkback" onclick="history.back()" onmouseout="this.className='off'" onmouseover="this.className='active'">back</div>
</div></td></tr>
<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote><p>The <a
href="https://rivendell.linuxfromscratch.org/index.html">Linux From
Scratch</a> (LFS) project provides step-by-step instructions on
building a customized Linux system entirely from source. Historically,
the project has provided separate System&#160;V and systemd editions,
which gave users a choice of init systems. Bruce Dubbs has <a
href="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/arc/lfs-announce/2026-02/msg00000.html">announced</a>
the project will no longer produce the System&#160;V version:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>There are two reasons for this decision. The first reason is
workload. No one working on LFS is paid. We rely completely on
volunteers. In LFS there are 88 packages. In BLFS there are over
1000. The volume of changes from upstream is overwhelming the
editors. In this release cycle that started on the 1st of September
until now, there have been 70 commits to LFS and 1155 commits to BLFS
(and counting). When making package updates, many packages need to be
checked for both System V and systemd. When preparing for release, all
packages need to be checked for each init system.</p>

<p>The second reason for dropping System V is that packages like GNOME
and soon KDE's Plasma are building in requirements that require
capabilities in systemd that are not in System V. This could
potentially be worked around with another init system like OpenRC, but
beyond the transition process it still does not address the ongoing
workload problem.</p>

<p>[...] As a personal note, I do not like this decision. To me LFS is
about learning how a system works. Understanding the boot process is a
big part of that. systemd is about 1678 "C" files plus many data
files. System V is "22" C files plus about 50 short bash scripts and
data files. Yes, systemd provides a lot of capabilities, but we will
be losing some things I consider important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next version, 13.0, is expected in March and will only focus on
systemd.</p>

futex kernel API</a> is a way for a user-space program to ensure that the
locks it holds are properly cleaned up when it exits.  But the API suffers
from a number of different problems, as André Almeida described in a <a
href="https://lpc.events/event/19/contributions/2108/">session</a> in the
<a href="https://lpc.events/event/19/sessions/225/#20251213">"Gaming on
Linux" microconference</a> at the 2025 Linux Plumbers Conference in Tokyo.
He had some ideas for a new API that would solve many of those problems,
which he wanted to discuss with attendees; there is a
difficult-to-trigger race condition that he wanted to talk about too.
