href="https://pganalyze.com/blog/postgres-18-async-io">writes in detail</a>
on the pganalyze blog about the asynchronous I/O capability coming with the
PostgreSQL&#160;18 release.
<p>
<blockquote class="bq">
	Asynchronous I/O delivers the most noticeable gains in cloud
	environments where storage is network-attached, such as Amazon EBS
	volumes. In these setups, individual disk reads often take multiple
	milliseconds, introducing substantial latency compared to local
	SSDs.
<p>
	With traditional synchronous I/O, each of these reads blocks query
	execution until the data arrives, leading to idle CPU time and
	degraded throughput. By contrast, asynchronous I/O allows Postgres
	to issue multiple read requests in parallel and continue processing
	while waiting for results. This reduces query latency and enables
	much more efficient use of available I/O bandwidth and CPU cycles.

function. Packages tagged as essential, and the packages that are
required by the set of essential packages, are always installed as
part of a Debian system. However, Debian's packaging rules do not
require developers to explicitly declare dependencies on that set of
packages (the essential set) but they can simply rely on the fact that those
will always be present. That means that changing the essential set, as
the project may wish to do occasionally, is more complicated than it
should be. This came to light recently when a Debian developer asked

Desktop from openSUSE due to violations of the project's packaging
policy.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The discovery of the bypass of the security whitelistings via the
<tt>deepin-feature-enable</tt> package marks a turning point in our assessment
of Deepin. We don't believe that the openSUSE Deepin packager acted
with bad intent when he implemented the "license agreement" dialog to
bypass our whitelisting restrictions. The dialog itself makes the
security concerns we have transparent, so this does not happen in a
sneaky way, at least not towards users. It was not discussed with us,
however, and it violates openSUSE packaging policies. Beyond the
security aspect, this also affects general packaging quality
assurance: the D-Bus configuration files and Polkit policies installed
by the <tt>deepin-feature-enable</tt> package are unknown to the package
manager and won't be cleaned up upon package removal, for
example. Such bypasses are not deemed acceptable by us.</p>

<p>The combination of these factors led us to the decision to remove
the Deepin desktop completely from openSUSE Tumbleweed and from the
future Leap 16.0 release. In openSUSE Leap 15.6 we will remove the
offending <tt>deepin-feature-enable</tt> package only. It is a difficult
decision given that the Deepin desktop has a considerable number of
users. We firmly believe the Deepin packaging and security assessment
in openSUSE needs a reboot, however, ideally involving new people that
can help get the Deepin packages into shape, establish a relationship
with Deepin upstream and keep an eye on bugfixes, thus avoiding
fruitless follow-up reviews that just waste our time. In such a new
setup we would be willing to have a look at all the sensitive Deepin
components again one by one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The announcement goes into detail about the bypass of
openSUSE packaging policy and the history of security reviews of
Deepin components. It also offers guidance on <a
