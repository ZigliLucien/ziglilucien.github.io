that allegedly impact <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/">GNU&#160;Mailman</a> 2.1,
since many folks assumed that it was no longer being supported. That's
not quite the case. Even though <a
href="https://wiki.list.org/DEV/Mailman%203.0">version&#160;3</a> of
the GNU Mailman mailing-list manager has been available
since&#160;2015, and version&#160;2 was declared (mostly) end of life
(EOL) in&#160;2020, there are still plenty of users and projects still
using version&#160;2.1.x. There is, as it turns out, a big difference between
<em>mostly</em> EOL and <em>actually</em> EOL. For example: <a
href="https://www.webpros.com/">WebPros</a>, the company behind the <a
href="https://cpanel.net/">cPanel</a> server and web-site-management
platform, still maintains a <a
href="https://github.com/cpanel/mailman2-python3">port of
Mailman&#160;2.1.x</a> to Python&#160;3 for its customers and was
quick to respond to reports of vulnerabilities. However, the
company and upstream Mailman project dispute that the CVEs are
valid.</p>

	I paid good money for my 24 CPU cores, but ./configure can only

	The purpose of a ./configure script is basically to run the
	compiler a bunch of times and check which runs succeeded. In this
	way it can test whether particular headers, functions, struct
	fields, etc. exist, which lets people write portable software. This

What this election exposed was the need for the organization to also
assess whether candidates were fully eligible to run and prepared to
be seated on the board before voting begins. This is something we will
add to the election timeline next year. While we have not finished
figuring out all of the requirements for that assessment, part of it
will be asking candidates to sign a Candidate Agreement at nomination
time. We also have some ideas on ways for potential candidates to have
more information even before submitting a nomination.
