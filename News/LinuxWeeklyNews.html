href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/kelnos/xfwl4#xfwl4-xfces-wayland-compositor">xfwl4</a>,
a Wayland compositor for Xfce:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Xfwl4 will not be based on the existing xfwm4 code. Instead, it
will be written from scratch in rust, using smithay building
blocks.</p>

<p>The first attempt at creating an Xfce Wayland compositor involved
modifying the existing xfwm4 code to support both X11 and Wayland in
parallel. However, this approach turned out to be the wrong path
forward for several reasons:</p>

<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
    <li>Xfwm4 is architected in a way that makes it very difficult to put the window management behavior behind generic interfaces that don't include X11 specifics.</li>
    <li>Refactoring Xfwm4 is risky, since it might introduce new bugs to X11. Having two parallel code bases will allow for rapid development and experimentation with the Wayland compositor, with zero risk to break xfwm4.</li>
    <li>Some X11 window management concepts just aren't available or supported by Wayland protocols at this time, and dealing with those differences can be difficult in an X11-first code base.</li>
    <li>Using the existing codebase would require us to use C and
    wlroots, even if a better alternative is available.</li>
</ul>

program, which started in April 2019:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The never-ending slop submissions take a serious mental toll to
manage and sometimes also a long time to debunk. Time and energy that
is completely wasted while also hampering our will to live.</p>

<p>I have also started to get the feeling that a lot of the security
reporters submit reports with a bad faith attitude. These "helpers"
try too hard to twist whatever they find into something horribly bad
and a critical vulnerability, but they rarely actively contribute to
actually improve curl. They can go to extreme efforts to argue and
insist on their specific current finding, but not to write a fix or
work with the team on improving curl long-term etc. I don't think we
need more of that.</p>

<p>There are these three bad trends combined that makes us take this
step: the mind-numbing AI slop, humans doing worse than ever and the
apparent will to poke holes rather than to help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stenberg writes that he still expects "<q>the best and our most
valued security reporters</q>" to continue informing the project when
security vulnerabilities are discovered. The program will officially
end on January 31, 2026.</p>

The
<a href="https://lkrg.org">
Linux Kernel Runtime Guard</a> (LKRG) is a out-of-tree loadable kernel module that
attempts to detect and report violations of the kernel's internal invariants,
such as might be caused by an in-progress security exploit or a rootkit.
LKRG has been experimental since its
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/749707/">
initial release in 2018</a>. In September
2025, the project
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/announce/2025/09/02/1">announced</a>

information to decide whether to include it in their kernel.
