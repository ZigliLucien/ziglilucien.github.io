a blog post</a> about taking over from interim CEO Laura Chambers, and
his plans for Mozilla and Firefox:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>As Mozilla moves forward, we will focus on becoming the trusted
software company. This is not a slogan. It is a direction that guides
how we build and how we grow. It means three things.</p>

<ul class="spacylist">
    <li>First: Every product we build must give people agency in how it works. Privacy, data use, and AI must be clear and understandable. Controls must be simple. AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off. People should know why a feature works the way it does and what value they get from it.</li>
    <li>Second: our business model must align with trust. We will grow through transparent monetization that people recognize and value.</li>
    <li>Third: Firefox will grow from a browser into a broader
    ecosystem of trusted software. Firefox will remain our anchor. It
    will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of
    new and trusted software additions.</li>

<p>My ultimate vision for this project is "NO VOJTUX NEEDED!" because
I believe Fedora should eventually be fully accessible out of the
box. We aren't there yet, which is where Vojtux comes in to fill the
gap. [...]</p>
<p>Key Features:<br />
-Speaks out of the box: When the live desktop is ready, Orca starts
automatically. After installation, it is configured so that it starts
on the login screen and also after logging in.<br />
-Batteries included: Comes with LIOS , Ocrdesktop, Tesseract,
Audacity, and command-line tools like Git and Curl. There are also
many preconfigured keyboard shortcuts.
