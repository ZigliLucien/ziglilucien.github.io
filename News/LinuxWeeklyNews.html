I don't normally blog about particular CVEs, but Yelp CVE-2025-3155 is
noteworthy because it is quite severe, public for several weeks now,
and not yet fixed upstream. In short, help files can read your
filesystem and execute arbitrary JavaScript code, allowing an attacker
to exfiltrate any files your Unix user has access to.
</blockquote>

<p>The vulnerability was first reported on December&#160;25, and it
was made public on March&#160;26 after the 90-day-disclosure deadline
was reached. <a

cannot prove that the program will not.
The ultimate check on the size of a BPF program is the
one-million-instruction limit â€” the verifier will refuse to process more than
one-million instructions, no matter what a BPF program does. Alexei Starovoitov gave
a talk at the 2025 Linux Storage, Filesystem,

why correctly written BPF programs shouldn't hit it, and how to make the user
