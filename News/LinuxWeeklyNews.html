The 
<a href="https://nixos.org/">
NixOS</a> moderation team, which is theoretically 
<a href="https://nixos.org/community/teams/moderation/">
in charge</a> of ensuring that community participation on the project's 
<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/">
repositories</a> and
<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/">discussion forum</a> remains welcoming and useful, has released
<a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/a-statement-from-members-of-the-moderation-team/69828">
a joint resignation statement</a>. This action was motivated by conflict with the project's steering committee (SC), which has repeatedly overridden the moderation team, leading the team members to decide that they could not continue acting as moderators. Arian Van Putten, speaking for the whole team, writes:
</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>
The SC has also shown, in private and public conversations, their lack of understanding of basic principles of community management and open communication. They have mistaken quiet and a lack of controversy for success and peace. They have consistently become upset when there is criticism, and gone quiet on crucial issues in between. We have some fundamental conflicts in this community, which absolutely require discussion. Meanwhile, discussion with the SC has only become less effective.
</p>

<p>
We think that the goal of moderation should not be to avoid difficult conversations - it's to navigate those difficult conversations in ways that remain safe and constructive. We believe we've made considerable progress as a community on making those conversations happen, and we believe they need to happen more for the project to grow, not be suppressed. We thank everyone for the growth that we have seen, and for their efforts to avoid personal focus in discussion, especially recently.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The NixOS project has had problems with community moderation stretching back
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/970824/">more than a year</a>. With the next steering council election coming up soon, it will be interesting to see whether the community selects a council that feels differently or not.

CPython
Core Dev Sprint</a>, held at Arm in Cambridge, UK.  The talk, entitled
"Tracing JIT and real world Python — aka: what we can learn from PyPy" was
meant to try to pass on some of his experiences "<q>optimizing existing
code for PyPy at a high-frequency trading firm</q>" to the
developers working on the <a
href="https://lwn.net/Archives/PythonIndex/#JIT">CPython JIT compiler</a>.  His goal was
to raise awareness of some of the problems he encountered:

<blockquote class="bq">
Until now CPython's performance has been particularly predictable, there are well established "performance tricks" to make code faster, and generally speaking you can mostly reason about the speed of a given piece of code "locally".
<p>
Adding a JIT completely changes how we reason about performance of a given program, for two reasons:
<ol class="spacylist">
    <li>JITted code can be very fast if your code conforms to the heuristics applied by the JIT compiler, but unexpectedly slow(-ish) otherwise;

    <li>the speed of a given piece of code might depend heavily on what
    happens elsewhere in the program, making it much harder to reason about
    performance locally.
</ol>
<p>
The end result is that modifying a line of code can significantly impact seemingly unrelated code. This effect becomes more pronounced as the JIT becomes more sophisticated.
</blockquote>


<p>
Cuni also gave a talk on Python performance, which LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1031707/">covered</a>, at
EuroPython 2025 in July.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
