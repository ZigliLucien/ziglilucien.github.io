href="https://opensource.org/blog/2026-osi-elections-update">announced</a>
that it will not be holding the 2026 spring board election. Instead,
it will be creating a working group to "<q>review and improve OSI's
board member selection process</q>" and provide recommendations by
September&#160;2026:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>The public election process was designed to gather community
priorities and improve board member selection, while final
appointments remained with the board.</p>

<p>Over time, that nuance has become a source of understandable
confusion for community members. Many reasonably expected elections to
function as elections normally do, and in fact, the board has
generally adopted the electorate's recommendations. When a process
feels unclear, trust suffers. When trust suffers, engagement becomes
harder. This is especially problematic for an organization whose
mission depends on legitimacy and credibility. [...]</p>

<p>OSI tried its experiment for the right reasons, but a variety of
factors resulted in "elections" that are performatively democratic
while being gameable and representative of only a small group, and
we've learned from the results. Now we are making space to align our
director selection process with our bylaws, to rebuild trust, and to
develop better, more durable and truly representative participation in
which the global stakeholder community can be heard.</p>

will be written from scratch in rust, using smithay building

<p>The first attempt at creating an Xfce Wayland compositor involved
modifying the existing xfwm4 code to support both X11 and Wayland in
parallel. However, this approach turned out to be the wrong path
forward for several reasons:</p>

<p>
<ul class="spacylist">
    <li>Xfwm4 is architected in a way that makes it very difficult to put the window management behavior behind generic interfaces that don't include X11 specifics.</li>
    <li>Refactoring Xfwm4 is risky, since it might introduce new bugs to X11. Having two parallel code bases will allow for rapid development and experimentation with the Wayland compositor, with zero risk to break xfwm4.</li>
    <li>Some X11 window management concepts just aren't available or supported by Wayland protocols at this time, and dealing with those differences can be difficult in an X11-first code base.</li>
    <li>Using the existing codebase would require us to use C and
    wlroots, even if a better alternative is available.</li>

try too hard to twist whatever they find into something horribly bad
and a critical vulnerability, but they rarely actively contribute to
actually improve curl. They can go to extreme efforts to argue and
insist on their specific current finding, but not to write a fix or
work with the team on improving curl long-term etc. I don't think we
need more of that.</p>

<p>There are these three bad trends combined that makes us take this
step: the mind-numbing AI slop, humans doing worse than ever and the
apparent will to poke holes rather than to help.</p>
