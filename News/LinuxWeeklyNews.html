fundamental kernel changes ever made; it can be thought of as being similar
to replacing the foundation of a building while it remains open for
business.  So it is not surprising that, for some years, the annual Linux
Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management, and BPF Summit has included a
session on the state of this transition.  The 2025 Summit was no exception,
with Matthew Wilcox updating the group on what has been accomplished, what
remains to be done, and where some of the significant problems are.

about the <a
href="https://discourse.flathub.org/t/upcoming-freedesktop-23-08-runtime-release-will-drop-openh264-extension/9022">announcement</a>
that the Freedesktop project is dropping OpenH264 from the <a
href="https://freedesktop-sdk.io/">Freedesktop SDK</a> for Flatpak
applications and runtimes.</p>

<p>Some Flatpak applications that depend on the Freedesktop runtime
version 23.08 will lose H.264 playback support starting with the
release scheduled for April, unless application developers replace it
with the <tt>ffmpeg-full</tt> extension. The 24.08 runtime is
unaffected, and future releases will include a new
<tt>codecs-extra</tt> extension to replace OpenH264 that includes <a
href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> with support for a number of
patented codecs.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Considering all things, I think and hope we made the correct decision
and hopefully the new <tt>org.freedesktop.Platform.codecs-extra</tt> works
out. libx264, libx265 and others are built from source and there are
no binaries or extra-data involved. So we should theoretically be able
to patch and fix any issues that come up in the future.</p>

<p>Apart from all this, I'm slightly worried at the prospects of legal
issues cropping up with this setup and also that the new extension
contains "too much", but we will have to see where things flow.</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
People are often convinced that OSS is more trustworthy than closed-source software because the code can be audited by practitioners and security professionals in order to detect vulnerabilities or backdoors. In this instance, this procedure has been made difficult by the fact that part of the code activating the backdoor was not included in the sources available within the git repository but was instead present in the maintainer-provided tarball. While this was used to hide the backdoor out of sight of most investigating eyes, this is also an opportunity for us to improve our software supply chain security processes.

address-space isolation</a> (ASI) as a way of
preventing future CPU vulnerabilities from leaking important
information. The core concept is to ensure that data that is not currently
needed is not present in memory, so that speculative execution cannot leak it.
The work is nowhere near ready to be incorporated into the mainline
kernel — not least of all because it has a large performance impact in its
current form — but it is likely to once again be a topic of discussion at the
