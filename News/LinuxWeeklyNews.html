<a
href="https://antocuni.eu/2025/09/24/tracing-jits-in-the-real-world--cpython-core-dev-sprint/">lengthy
blog post</a> that describes his talk at the recently completed

CPython
Core Dev Sprint</a>, held at Arm in Cambridge, UK.  The talk, entitled
"Tracing JIT and real world Python â€” aka: what we can learn from PyPy" was
meant to try to pass on some of his experiences "<q>optimizing existing
code for PyPy at a high-frequency trading firm</q>" to the
developers working on the <a
href="https://lwn.net/Archives/PythonIndex/#JIT">CPython JIT compiler</a>.  His goal was
to raise awareness of some of the problems he encountered:

<blockquote class="bq">
Until now CPython's performance has been particularly predictable, there are well established "performance tricks" to make code faster, and generally speaking you can mostly reason about the speed of a given piece of code "locally".
<p>
Adding a JIT completely changes how we reason about performance of a given program, for two reasons:
<ol class="spacylist">
    <li>JITted code can be very fast if your code conforms to the heuristics applied by the JIT compiler, but unexpectedly slow(-ish) otherwise;

    <li>the speed of a given piece of code might depend heavily on what
    happens elsewhere in the program, making it much harder to reason about
    performance locally.
</ol>
<p>
The end result is that modifying a line of code can significantly impact seemingly unrelated code. This effect becomes more pronounced as the JIT becomes more sophisticated.
</blockquote>


<p>
Cuni also gave a talk on Python performance, which LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1031707/">covered</a>, at
EuroPython 2025 in July.</blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

AIO lets PostgreSQL issue multiple I/O requests concurrently instead

(OpenSSF) has put together a <a href="https://openssf.org/blog/2025/09/23/open-infrastructure-is-not-free-a-joint-statement-on-sustainable-stewardship/">joint statement</a> from many of the public
package repositories for various languages about the need for assistance in
maintaining these commons.  Services such as <a
href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> for Python, <a
href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> for Rust, and many others are
working together to try to find ways to sustain these services in the face
of challenges from "<q>automated CI systems, large-scale dependency
scanners, and ephemeral container builds</q>" all downloading enormous
amounts of package data, coupled with the rise of generative and agentic AI
"<q>driving a further explosion of machine-driven, often wasteful automated
usage, compounding the existing challenges</q>".  It is not a crisis, yet,
they say, but it is headed in that direction.


<blockquote class="bq">
Despite serving billions (perhaps even trillions) of downloads each month (largely driven by commercial-scale consumption), many of these services are funded by a small group of benefactors. Sometimes they are supported by commercial vendors, such as Sonatype (Maven Central), GitHub (npm) or Microsoft (NuGet). At other times, they are supported by nonprofit foundations that rely on grants, donations, and sponsorships to cover their maintenance, operation, and staffing.
<p>
Regardless of the operating model, the pattern remains the same: a small number of organizations absorb the majority of infrastructure costs, while the overwhelming majority of large-scale users, including commercial entities that generate demand and <b>extract economic value, consume these services without contributing to their sustainability</b>.
