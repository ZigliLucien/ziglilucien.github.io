0.1</a> of the <a href="https://wayback.freedesktop.org/">Wayback</a>
project has been released:</p>

<blockquote class="bq">
<p>Wayback is an X11 compatibility layer that allows for running full
X11-only desktop environments using Wayland. It is essentially an X11
server backed by Wayland, leveraging <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots">wlroots</a> and <tt>Xwayland</tt>. Our goal is
for Wayback to eventually be a completely drop-in replacement to the
<tt>Xorg</tt> binary, thus reducing maintenance burden for distro
maintainers.</p>

<p>Ever since Wayback was announced on <a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@ariadne/114763023239748529">June&#160;28</a>, we have been making lots
of progress to get it as stable and functional as possible, and while
this is a preview release it is already daily-driveable by users with
simple requirements, as long as they don't mind bugs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The release is considered alpha-quality and is missing a number of
features, including <a
href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayback/wayback/-/issues/8">multi-monitor
support</a> and <a
href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayback/wayback/-/issues/55">DPMS</a>,

<p>In our latest update of the Android app <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/android/releases/tag/2025.7.1">2025.7.1</a>, we've added a

will be shared between Android and iOS, adding a good layer of
consistency between our most-used companion apps. The idea is to make
it much more seamless to add new users or set up new devices (no need
to type the URL in your Android Automotive device!).</p>

<p>We've also made <a href="https://my.home-assistant.io/">My
Links</a> work better. If you're unfamiliar with My Links, they're
those cool links (<a

make</a>) that bring you right to an integration, blueprint, add-on,
or settings page. They have always worked great on desktop, but up
until recently, they were a bit clunky to use on mobile. Now you can
get to the link's destination with a single click.</p>

Python has recently seen a number of experiments to improve its parallel

PEP&#160;795</a> ("Deep Immutability in Python")
seeks to make efficient sharing of data between subinterpreters possible by
allowing Python objects to be "frozen", so that they can be accessed from
multiple subinterpreters without copying or synchronization.
That task is more difficult than it
seems, and the PEP prompted a good deal of skepticism from the Python community.

	bringing supply chain transparency and security to all open source
	software development. Our initial support for the PyPI (Python),
