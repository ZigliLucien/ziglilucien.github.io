The second part is we reduce migration by 25%, so that we can allow the housing stock to be built up again and by doing that – as well as stopping foreigners for two years from purchasing Australian homes – we give young Australians a go.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/16/leaders-debate-live-updates-tonight-australian-election-2025-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-latest-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
