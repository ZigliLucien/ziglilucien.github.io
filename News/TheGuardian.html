His wife, who is eight months pregnant, said her husband was not told why he was being detained and that officers assumed he was on a visa – but actually he has a green card, allowing him to stay in the US and protecting his constitutional rights.</p><p>Khalil says his detention is part of a crackdown on dissent – and to deter others from protesting. During pro-Palestine protests on the Columbia campus last year he acted as a mediator between the university and the demonstrators, and, unlike many students, left his face uncovered. Then Donald Trump was elected US president and promised to clamp down on student protests.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/mar/20/mahmoud-khalil-and-donald-trump-assault-on-free-speech-podcast">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
