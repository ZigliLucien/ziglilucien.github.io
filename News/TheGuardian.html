Maybe the most gobsmacking detail about the accidental release of Hadush Kebatu from HMP Chelmsford was this, from a delivery driver who was delivering equipment to the prison as he left: Kebatu, who was serving a sentence for sexual assault and was due to be deported, appeared baffled as he walked free, and lingered outside the gates for an hour and a half before heading away. “They [the officers] were basically sending him away, saying, ‘Go, you’ve been released, you go,’” the driver <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/witness-wanted-migrant-was-confused-and-directed-to-station-by-prison-staff-13457133">told Sky News</a>. “He kept scratching his head and saying, ‘Where do I go, where do I go?’”</p><p>On its face, that might look like incompetence.
