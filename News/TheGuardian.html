 The Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office said crews responded to a fire at Canfield Mountain about 1.30 pm and gunshots were reported about a half hour later.<br><br>
 Sheriff Bob Norris told reporters officials didn’t know if anyone else was shot.<br><br>
 “We don’t know how many suspects are up there, and we don’t know how many casualties there are,” Norris said. “We are actively taking sniper fire as we speak.”<br><br>
 People are still coming off the mountain, the sheriff said, so it “would be safe to assume” that others are still up there.<br><br>
