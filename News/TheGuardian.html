Look, it could happen to anyone: I well remember, for example, the time I added my mum to a thread with my siblings discussing what to get her for Christmas. On the other hand, I don’t have a secure communications facility in my house for when I need to get something out on the family group chat. Also, we rarely digress from pictures of cute kids to setting out war plans for an imminent set of airstrikes on the Houthis in Yemen.</p><p>So perhaps <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/journalist-trump-yemen-war-chat-reaction">the latest Trump administration hullabaloo</a> isn’t that relatable, after all. Two days after the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg revealed that he had been mystifyingly added to a thread on Signal – an encrypted WhatsApp-like instant messaging app – in which vice-president JD Vance, defence secretary Pete Hegseth, and a host of others chatted about a highly sensitive operation, there are as many questions as answers. How on earth did Goldberg get added in the first place? Why didn’t anybody realise the error? Are White House officials doing this all the time? And how vulnerable are their communications to interception from America’s adversaries?</p><p><em><strong>Spring statement </strong></em>| Rachel Reeves <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/25/chancellor-to-increase-defence-spending-by-22bn-to-secure-britains-future">will make additional welfare cuts in her spring statement</a> on Wednesday after the Office for Budget Responsibility rejected her estimate of savings from the changes announced last week. The chancellor is expected to announce an additional £500m in benefits cuts to make up part of the £1.6bn shortfall.</p><p><em><strong>Ukraine</strong></em> | Russia and Ukraine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/25/russia-and-ukraine-agree-ceasefire-in-black-sea">have agreed to “eliminate the use of force” in the Black Sea</a>, though the Kremlin said it was conditional on sanctions relief for its agricultural exports. The warring parties also agreed to implement a previously announced 30-day halt on attacks against energy networks.</p><p><em><strong>Assisted dying</strong></em> | The introduction of assisted dying in England and Wales <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/25/assisted-dying-law-thrown-into-doubt-as-plans-for-rollout-delayed-by-two-years">is likely to be pushed back by a further two years</a> in a delay that supporters fear could mean the law never comes into force. The delay marks the latest major change to the proposals, which have proven deeply contentious in the Commons and beyond.</p><p><em><strong>Gaza </strong></em>| Press freedom organisations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/25/journalists-killed-israeli-strikes-hossam-shabat-mohammed-mansour-press-freedom-groups-condemn">have condemned the killing of two journalists in Gaza</a> on Monday by the Israeli armed forces.
