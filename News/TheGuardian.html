 The question, which has dogged Yoon through a series of moves by the opposition to end his presidency, will be highlighted tomorrow, when parliament will make a second attempt at his impeachment. The embattled president yesterday promised to “fight until the end to prevent the forces and criminal groups that have been responsible for paralysing the country’s government and disrupting the nation’s constitutional order from threatening the future of the Republic of Korea”.<br><br>
 The past week has seen political chaos and huge protests by angry South Koreans after Yoon’s baffling, late night martial law edict on 3 December. As lawmakers debate impeachment, investigations into Yoon’s decree have been accompanied by detentions of high-level officials.
