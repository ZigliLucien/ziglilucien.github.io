Official Britain is laying out the red carpet for Donald Trump today. It is the first full day of his unprecedented state visit, and he will spend the day with King Charles at Windsor Castle enjoying the finest pageantry the nation can lay on. Keir Starmer, like other Western leaders, has concluded that the key to getting positive outcomes from Trump is flattery and shameless sucking up, and (not for the first time) the royal family is being deployed to this end.</p><p>But civic Britain will also have its say on Trump today, and – perhaps mindful of his obsession with big crowds and his (supposed) love for free speech – there will be <a href="https://stoptrump.org.uk/local-protests/">protests all over the country</a>, with the main one in London. When Mike Pence, Trump’s vice president in the Trump’s first administration, was asked he felt about being booed one night when he attended the theatre, he said that was “the sound of freedom”. Trump’s response to protesters is much darker. But there is almost no chance of his hearing any of them today; his state visit is taking place entirely behind closed doors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/17/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-king-charles-windsor-politics-latest-news-updates-labour-keir-starmer">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
