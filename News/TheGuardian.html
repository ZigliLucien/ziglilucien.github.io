The Conservatives have repeatedly criticised the government for the way they swiftly settled public sector pay disputes when they took office; they argue that Labour was too generous to the unions, thereby encouraging them to threaten further strikes.</p><p>Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question.</p><p><strong>Streeting says he is “disappointed” by the proposed strike, and he insists resident doctors have had a relatively good outcome on pay. </strong>He says:</p><p>I remain disappointed that despite all that we have been able to achieve in this last year, and that the majority of resident doctors in the BMA did not vote to strike, the BMA is continuing to threaten strike action.</p><p>I accepted the DDRB’s recommendation for resident doctors, awarding an average pay rise of 5.4%, the highest across the public sector. Accepting this above inflation recommendation, which was significantly higher than affordability, required reprioritisation of NHS budgets. Because of this government’s commitment to recognising the value of the medical workforce, we made back-office efficiency savings to invest in the frontline. That was not inevitable, it was an active political choice this government made. Taken with the previous deal I made with the BMA last year, this means resident doctors will receive an average pay rise of 28.9% over the last 3 years.</p><p><strong>He says the NHS is “finally moving in the right direction” and that a strike will “put that recovery at risk”.</strong></p><p><strong>He offers to hold meet the BMA to hold talks to avert the strike. </strong>He says:</p><p>I stand ready to meet with you again at your earliest convenience to resolve this dispute without the need for strike action. I would like to once again extend my offer to meet with your entire committee to discuss this.</p><p>As I have stated many times, in private and in public, with you and your predecessors, you will not find another health and social care secretary as sympathetic to resident doctors as me. By choosing to strike instead of working in partnership to improve conditions for your members and the NHS, you are squandering an opportunity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/09/pmqs-live-uk-politics-latest-updates-starmer-badenoch-macron-labour-conservatives">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
