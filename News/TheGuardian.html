The Israeli public broadcaster Kan said dozens of fighter jets were involved.</p><p>The Israeli military said on Saturday morning it hit missile manufacturing sites and aerial defences in several areas and had completed its “targeted” air attacks, and that its planes had safely returned home. Israel’s public broadcaster said three waves of strikes had been completed. The Israeli military said after its airstrikes: “If the regime in Iran were to make the mistake of beginning a new round of escalation, we will be obligated to respond.”</p><p>Two soldiers were killed in Saturday morning’s Israeli airstrikes on Iran, the official Iranian news agency IRNA reported.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2024/oct/26/keir-starmer-iran-respond-israeli-strikes-video">UK</a> and US have warned against further escalation, while nations including Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan have all condemned the attacks.</p><p>Israel bears “full responsibility” for the escalation of conflict in the Middle East, the Pakistan foreign ministry has said, adding that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-israel-iran-strikes-explosions-tehran">Israeli strikes</a> “undermine the path to regional peace and stability”.</p><p>Iran is “entitled and obligated to defend itself against external aggressive acts”, its foreign ministry has said.

A semi-official Iranian news agency vowed a “proportional reaction” to Israeli moves against Tehran.</p><p>A senior Biden official said the strikes were “extensive”, “precise” and against military targets across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> in order to deter future aggression. The official stressed that the US considered the operation to be an “end to the exchange of fire between Israel and Iran” and that the US had no involvement in the Israeli military operation.</p><p>The US news outlet Axios reported on Saturday that US and Israeli officials assess that Iran will respond militarily but in a limited fashion.</p><p>Iran and Iraq briefly suspended all flights after the Israeli strikes. Iran’s civil aviation authority later resumed flights from 9am (05.30 GMT) on Saturday.</p><p>Iranian media initially appeared to downplay the airstrikes, noting that Tehran’s airport was operating normally. State TV reported several strong explosions heard around the capital, while the state news agency, IRNA, said there had been no casualties. There was no immediate official comment about the source of explosions, which Iranian news outlets reported were under investigation. Air defence systems were activated around the country.</p><p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) took the rare step of acknowledging the attack on Iran, <a href="https://x.com/IDF/status/1849957541301666038">in a statement</a> that confirmed a decades-old shadow war between the enemy states has now firmly moved into the open. The IDF posted on X: “In response to months of continuous attacks from the regime in Iran against the state of Israel – right now the Israel Defense Forces is conducting precise strikes on military targets in Iran.”</p><p>The attacks were widely expected as a retaliation to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/iran-imminent-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-us-warns">missile barrage launched by Iran</a> on 1 October in which an estimated 180 ballistic missiles were fired towards Tel Aviv and military bases, in an unprecedented direct altercation between the two regional enemy states.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/26/idf-strikes-military-sites-in-iran-what-we-know-so-far">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
