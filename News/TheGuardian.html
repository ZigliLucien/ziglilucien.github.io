I was asked on a couple of other programmes this morning about the construction capacity problems that we’re facing in terms of building those million and a half. We’ve got to do government differently. That isn’t an MHCLG problem. That cuts across the Department for Education, Department for Work and Pensions, Department for Business.

They share our ambition. They are working absolutely flat out to make the changes to the planning system that we’ve already taken forward, and they’ll continue to do that.</p><p>Too many people in Whitehall are comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline. Have forgotten, to paraphrase JFK, that you choose change, not because it’s easy but because it’s hard.</p><p>I totally get that when trust in politics is so low, we must be careful about the promises we make. But across Whitehall and Westminster that’s been internalised as ‘don’t say anything’, ‘don’t try anything too ambitious’, ‘set targets that will happen anyway’.</p><p>In the early days of this government, ministers were walking around departments saying, ‘we’re not going to be like the previous administration, we’ve got your back’.
