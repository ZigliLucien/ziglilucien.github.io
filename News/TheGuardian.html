Shortly after midnight local time, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/06/pakistan-vows-to-retaliate-after-wave-of-indian-missiles-hit-country">India said it had conducted strikes on nine sites in Pakistan</a>, reportedly killing at least 26 people, in response to a recent militant attack on tourists in Indian Kashmir. Delhi claimed that it had hit sites of “terrorist infrastructure”, and said that its action was “focused, measured, and non-escalatory”. But Islamabad’s response suggests that its analysis is dangerously different.</p><p>The strikes constituted the largest such Indian attack on Pakistan in more than half a century, and marked the worst confrontation between the two nuclear-armed powers since 2019. Pakistan responded with shelling of Indian Kashmir, and there were claims – not corroborated, and to be treated with caution – that it has shot down five Indian jets. The country’s military also claimed that a hydropower plant had been hit. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that his country “has every right to give a befitting reply to this act of war”.</p><p><em><strong>Middle East | </strong></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/06/hamas-israel-hunger-war-in-gaza">An Israeli government minister has vowed</a> that “Gaza will be entirely destroyed” as a result of an Israeli military victory, and that its Palestinian population will “leave in great numbers to third countries”.

The storms arrived in the early hours of the night, lasting six hours before easing by about 8.30am on Friday morning. At Safdarjung, the primary weather station in Delhi, 77mm of rain was recorded, the majority of which, 60mm, fell within the first three hours. The event itself was the second highest 24-hour rainfall total in Delhi during May since 1901. The deluge of rain led to flash flooding, felled trees, widespread disruption and claimed seven lives.</p><p>Further sharp showers are forecast across India this week, alongside thunderstorms across western and central parts where relatively cooler air will become situated aloft through the course of Monday and promote convection. Some forecast models show the potential for thunderstorms to produce very heavy rainfall, particularly in Gujarat and south-west Rajasthan, until Thursday. However, due to the nature of thunderstorm formation, the exact intensity can be difficult to forecast days ahead, and often still proves too tricky to predict on the day.
