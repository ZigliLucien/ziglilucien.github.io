Rescue operations were continuing. Another fire broke out in a metal warehouse.</p><p><strong>A Shahed drone exploded near an apartment building in Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region</strong>, shattering windows and doors, the regional military administration chief said.

There were no immediate reports of damage to the centre, it said.</p><p><strong>German chancellor Friedrich Merz urged Trump in an Oval Office meeting to increase pressure on Russia</strong> to end the war.</p><p><strong>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un vowed to “unconditionally support” Russia</strong> in the war at a meeting with top Russian security official Sergei Shoigu, Pyongyang state media reported.<br><em>With agencies</em></p><p>How and when our military deems it appropriate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/06/ukraine-war-live-update-russia-kyiv-drone-air-attack-putin-zelenskyy-latest-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
