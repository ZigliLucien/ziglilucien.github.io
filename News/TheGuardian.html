 About half of US adults approve of <strong>Trump’s approach to immigration</strong>, the survey shows, but <strong>only about </strong><strong>four in 10 have a positive view of the way he’s handling the economy and trade negotiations</strong>.<br><br>
 The poll indicates that many Americans are still on board with Trump’s efforts to ramp up deportations and restrict immigration. But it also suggests that the Republican president’s threats to impose tariffs – which have been accompanied by tumbling consumer confidence and wild stock market swings – might be erasing his advantage on another issue that he made central to his winning 2024 campaign.<br><br>
 The economy was a drag on then president Joe Biden, who saw the share of Americans who approved of his handling of the economy fall to a low of roughly three in 10 in 2023. Trump drew considerable strength in November from voters who prioritized the economy, but just before he took office in January, an AP-NORC poll found that few Americans had high confidence that he’d make progress on lowering prices in his first year.<br><br>
 Views of Trump’s job performance overall are more negative than positive, the survey found. <strong>About </strong><strong>four in 10 US adults approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president, and more than half disapprove</strong>.</p><p>Wall Street is set to join the global sell-off when trading begins in around two hours.</p><p>Hopes that this week’s reciprocal tariffs would not be as harsh as feared were dashed over the weekend after US President Trump doubled down on his pursuit of using import levies to ‘make America great again’. With just a couple of days to go until the White House outlines the details of the reciprocal tariffs – the broadest set of restrictions yet to be unveiled by the Trump administration – there is a growing sense of panic in the markets about the scale and implications of the April 2 announcement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/31/donald-trump-third-term-putin-russia-iran-tariffs-us-politics-live-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
