 The program, lauded as one of the biggest presidential actions to help immigrant families in years, allowed undocumented spouses and stepchildren of US citizens to apply for a green card without first having to leave the country.<br><br>
 The temporary relief from deportation brought a brief sense of security to some 500,000 immigrants estimated to benefit from the program before Texas-based U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker put it on hold in August, days after applicants filed their paperwork.<br><br>
 Barker ruled yesterday that the Biden administration had overstepped its authority by implementing the program and had stretched the legal interpretation of relevant immigration law “<strong>past its breaking point</strong>.”<br><br>
 The short-lived Biden administration initiative known as <strong>“Keeping Families Together”</strong> would have been unlikely to remain in place after Donald Trump took office in January.
