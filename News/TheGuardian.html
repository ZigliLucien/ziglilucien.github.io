 Emergency services were called to the scene at Dunkeswell aerodrome, near Honiton, at 1pm on Friday “following concerns for the welfare of two people”, Devon and Cornwall police said.<br><br>
 The force added: “It was reported that they were skydivers. They were sadly both confirmed deceased at the scene and their families have been informed.<br><br>
 “Scene guards remain in place and inquiries are ongoing by the relevant agencies.”<br><br>
 Anyone with information has been asked to contact police.<br><br>
 A spokesperson for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it was aware of the incident and its “thoughts are of course with the friends and family at this difficult time”.<br><br>
 The CAA added: “We will work closely with the relevant authorities to understand what happened and are awaiting the report into the incident.”<br><br>
 The national governing body British Skydiving said it would investigate and send a report to the coroner, police, the Civil Aviation Authority, British Skydiving Safety and Training Committee and any other relevant authorities, the BBC reported.<br><br>
 A statement from British Skydiving said: “British Skydiving has been notified of a tragic accident in which two jumpers lost their lives.<br><br>
 “Our deepest condolences go to their families, friends and the entire skydiving community.”<br><br>
 Dunkeswell aerodrome is a former RAF site located in the Blackdown Hills area, close to Devon’s border with Somerset.<br><br>
 The aerodrome’s website said it was built and set up as an US naval base during the second world war and, at 839ft above sea level, is the highest licensed airfield in the UK.<br><br>
 Skydiving deaths in the UK are statistically rare with tandem jumps being particularly safe.<br><br>
 The British Parachute Association has previously said in the UK in the last 20-year block studied, from 2001-20, there were reportedly no tandem skydive fatalities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/14/two-skydivers-killed-in-tragic-accident-at-airfield-in-devon">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
