No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie.”</p><p>Kirk, the executive director of Turning Point USA (TPUSA), was shot at about 12.10pm local time while appearing at an event. In video posts circulating on social media, Kirk can be seen being struck while speaking and sitting beneath a tent. <a href="https://x.com/Anarseldain/status/1965847654946189339">Video footage</a> shows students on campus running away from the sound of a gunshot.</p><p>As of Wednesday evening, Utah officials <a href="https://apnews.com/live/utah-valley-university-charlie-kirk-shooting-updates#00000199-3648-d313-a9fb-3f7c12780000">said</a> no one was in custody and that a manhunt was ongoing.</p><p>One person detained at the scene, George Zinn, was deemed not to be a suspect but was charged with obstructing justice. A second person taken into custody was released after being interviewed. Neither had ties to the shooting, according to the university.</p><p>The shooting was “believed to be a targeted attack”, with the shooter firing from the roof of a building into the student courtyard, the university said.</p><p>Kirk was about 20 minutes into a presentation when a single shot was fired at him, the university said.</p><p>Jeff Long, the university police chief, said he could not disclose whether the gun used in the killing had been recovered. The university said it had six officers working alongside Kirk’s security team at the event, which was attended by roughly 3,000 people.</p><p>Trump blamed the violence on the rhetoric of the “radical left” in an evening video address, while the suspect’s identity and motives remained unconfirmed. Spencer Cox, Utah’s governor, called the killing a “political assassination”.</p><p>Political leaders in the US immediately condemned the attack. Joe Biden, the former US president, tweeted: “There is no place in our country for this kind of violence. It must end now. Jill and I are praying for Charlie Kirk’s family and loved ones.”</p><p>Barack Obama also condemned political violence, writing on X: “We don’t yet know what motivated the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk, but this kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy.
