We have long been clear that adequate compensation must be provided to these entities as they have invested in good faith in order to meet their liabilities and continue to fund everyone’s pensions – today’s announcements is silent on that point …</p><p>There are billions of pounds invested in large-scale residential and mixed-use developments, and it is essential that reform is mindful of the rights of property owners as well as leaseholders. In our legal system contract is sacrosanct and legislative changes that cut across and undermine existing commercial agreements will raise the risk premium that investors attach to the UK at a time when the government is seeking to attract domestic and private capital for its growth agenda.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/jan/27/uk-politics-latest-news-updates-keir-starmer-leaseholders-andy-burnham-labour-reform">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
