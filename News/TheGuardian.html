It’s absolutely critical that we give police the resources they need at the federal level to work with their state counterparts, particularly to tackle crime which is across the state borders and which is transnational in nature, like serious organised crime and drug trafficking.</p><p>This is a plan that’s been in the work for some time. We have been carefully examining other models around the country and around the world to see what will work best and we’re responding to what our candidates are hearing in the field.</p><p>These guys [Coalition] had nine years in [government], nine years in, only just three years ago, and they certainly weren’t tackling crime that they should have been doing it. The problem is here it is all about a change in a generation. It’s all about early intervention. It’s all about teaching kids critical thinking …</p><p>So as much as he’s doing ‘tough on crime’, but <strong>we see this is always in the second week – stuff on defence, stuff on crime.
