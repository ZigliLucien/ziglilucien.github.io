The proposals will be set out in a white paper on post-16 education and skills being published later.</p><p>In a new release explaining how the system will work, the <strong>Department for Education</strong> says:</p><p>These are new vocational qualifications tied to rigorous and real-world job standards. They will replace other qualifications to sit alongside T Levels and A levels, providing a clear option for young people who want to get on in the world of work, university or apprenticeships but want to explore different key sectors, which could include engineering, agriculture, digital or creative, before choosing where to specialise. Unlike T-levels, which are equivalent to 3 A-levels, young people will be able to take a mixture of V-levels and A-levels – offering more choice and flexibility.</p><p>For example, a student wanting to get into either the creative arts or media industry could choose to do a mixed V-level and A-level study programme, by taking two V-levels (one in Craft and Design; and one in Media, Broadcast and Production) and one A-level in Music. Or, a student wanting to get into either the health or fitness industry – but also wants to learn more about digital – could do three V-levels (in Sport and Exercise Science; Digital; and Health and Care services).</p><p>Technical and vocational education is the backbone of this country’s economy and central to breaking the link between background and success, helping hundreds of thousands of young people get the skills they need to get good jobs.</p><p>But for too long it has been an afterthought. Young people have been left to navigate an overcomplicated landscape and repeatedly labelled as ‘failures’ by a system that has held them back from all-important English and maths grades.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/20/uk-politics-latest-news-updates-prince-andrew-covid-starmer-labour-reform-education">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
