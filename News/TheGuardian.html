They said they were part of an MPs’ delegation coming to visit humanitarian aid projects and communities in the West Bank with UK charity partners. The pair were on their way back to the UK on Sunday, according to the chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones.<br><br>
 The foreign secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/david-lammy">David Lammy</a>, said in a statement on Saturday: “It is unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning that two British MPs on a parliamentary delegation to Israel have been detained and refused entry by the Israeli authorities.<br><br>
 “I have made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British parliamentarians, and we have been in contact with both MPs tonight to offer our support.<br><br>
 “The UK government’s focus remains securing a return to the ceasefire and negotiations to stop the bloodshed, free the hostages and end the conflict in Gaza.”</p><p>In a joint statement posted on X, the two MPs said they were “astounded” at being denied entry, and that it was vital for parliamentarians to be able to witness the situation on the ground in Palestine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/05/uk-foreign-secretary-criticises-israel-for-denying-two-labour-mps-entry">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
