Here is a report containing some video of the funeral on Sunday:</p><p>Hospitals in Gaza say <strong>Israeli airstrikes killed at least 19 people on Sunday</strong>, including six children at a water collection point.</p><p>In Gaza, officials at Al-Awda Hospital in central Gaza said it received 10 bodies after an Israeli strike on a water collection point in Nuseirat, also in central Gaza. Among the dead were six children, the hospital said.<br><br>
 Ramadan Nassar, a witness who lives in the area, told The Associated Press that around 20 children and 14 adults were lined up Sunday morning to fill up water. When the strike occurred, everyone ran and some, including those who were severely injured, fell to the ground, he said.<br><br>
 He said Palestinians walk some 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) to fetch water from the area.<br><br>
 The Israeli military said it was targeting a militant but that a technical error made its munition fall “dozens of meters from the target.” It said the incident was being examined.<br><br>
 In the central town of Zawaida, an Israeli strike on a home killed nine, including two women and three children, officials at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said.<br><br>
 The military had no immediate comment on that strike. Israel blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militant group operates out of populated areas.<br></p><p>In the West Bank, where violence between Israeli troops and Palestinians has been compounded by attacks on Palestinians by Israeli settlers, funerals were held for a Palestinian-American and a Palestinian friend of his.<br><br>
 The Palestinian Health Ministry said Musallet, a Florida native, was killed after being beaten by Israeli settlers. Diana Halum, a cousin, said the attack occurred on his family’s land. The Health Ministry initially identified him as Seifeddine Musalat, 23.<br><br>
 Musallet’s friend, Mohammed al-Shalabi, was shot in the chest, according to the ministry.<br><br>
 On Sunday, their bodies were carried through the streets of Al-Mazraa a-Sharqiya, a town south of where they were killed. Mourners, waving Palestinian flags, chanted “God is great.”<br><br>
 In a statement Saturday, Musallet’s family said he was “a kind, hard-working, and deeply-respected young man, working to build his dreams.” It said he built a business in Tampa, Florida, and that he was deeply connected to his Palestinians heritage.<br><br>
 Musallet’s family said it wants the U.S. State Department to investigate his death and hold the settlers accountable. The State Department said it was aware of the reports of his death but had no comment out of respect for the family.<br><br>
 Israel’s military has said Palestinians hurled rocks at Israelis in the area on Friday, lightly wounding two people and setting off a larger confrontation.<br></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jul/13/iran-nuclear-talks-us-israel-further-attacks-middle-east-crisis-live">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
