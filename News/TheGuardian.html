The Nato summit that started last night in the Netherlands could hardly be better timed for Donald Trump: after declaring himself the saviour of world peace as Iran and Israel agreed a tentative ceasefire, he now intends to take a victory lap in Europe. European leaders, for their part, will be desperate for him to feel like he is getting his due.</p><p>That is part of why member states signed up to a new defence spending commitment that Trump has long demanded – and part of why the UK is buying a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/24/uk-to-expand-nuclear-deterrent-with-us-fighter-jets-capable-of-carrying-warheads">squadron of US-made fighter jets</a> to carry nuclear warheads. But as well as anxieties about the US’s reliability, all of that also reflects Europe’s recognition that it faces a serious new threat to the east.</p><p><em><strong>Iran </strong></em>| A classified assessment of US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities says they did not destroy two of the sites and likely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/24/iran-strikes-nuclear-sites-report">only set back the nuclear program by a few months</a>, according to two people familiar with the report.
