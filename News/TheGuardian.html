I want to harness all of the talent in my team, take it forward under my leadership and meet the Australian people where they are because, clearly we didn’t do that at the last election.

I have listened. We got it wrong. We need to do things differently, going forward, and we do need a fresh approach. So, on Tuesday morning when the Liberal party room meets in Canberra, I will be putting myself forward for the position of leader of the federal party.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/may/09/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-labor-liberals-leader-coalition-sussan-ley-angus-taylor-mushroom-murders-trial-erin-patterson-ntwnfb">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
