 Samir Zitouni, known as Sam, was working onboard the London North Eastern Railway (LNER) high-speed train from Doncaster to London when the attack happened on 1 November.<br><br>
 LNER said the 48-year-old, who has worked for the company for more than 20 years, has been credited with helping to save multiple lives after passengers came under threat in Huntingdon.<br><br>
 British Transport police said Zitouni was now able to continue his recovery at home.<br><br>
 The force said on Saturday: “Samir Zitouni had been in a critical condition having suffered multiple injuries, and thanks to the efforts of NHS medical staff he’s been able to be discharged from hospital today.”<br><br>
 His family said: “We are so grateful for the outpouring of support from the public, and very touched by all the kind words about Sam’s brave actions on the night of the attack.<br><br>
 “While we are really happy to have him home, he still has a significant recovery ahead and we would now like to be left in privacy to care for him as a family.”<br><br>
 Zitouni’s job is customer experience host, which largely involves providing onboard catering.<br><br>
 He was among 11 patients treated in hospital for injuries sustained during the attack, which is understood to have started shortly after the train left Peterborough station.</p><p>Among the injured was Jonathan Gjoshe, 22, a Scunthorpe United footballer who was treated for non-life-threatening injuries, and Stephen Crean, 61, who sustained stab injuries.<br><br>
 Anthony Williams, 32, was remanded into custody at Peterborough magistrates court on 3 November charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, two counts of possession of a bladed article and one count of actual bodily harm. One of the attempted murder counts relates to a separate incident at a London station.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/nov/15/train-worker-who-protected-passengers-in-huntingdon-attack-leaves-hospital">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
