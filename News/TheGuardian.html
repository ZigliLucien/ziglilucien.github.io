What we know on day 1,425</p><p><strong>Russia is</strong> <strong>taking aim at Ukraine’s nuclear power system</strong>, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday, as the Kremlin continues to try to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/16/urkraine-bucha-russia-weaponisation-winter-air-strikes-power-plants">freeze Ukraine into submission</a> by crippling its energy grid. “We do not see any willingness on the part of the aggressor to comply with any agreements or end the war,” the Ukrainian president said. “Instead, there is ample information about preparations for further Russian strikes on our <strong>energy sector and infrastructure, including facilities and networks that serve our nuclear power plants</strong>. Each such Russian strike on the energy sector amid such a harsh winter weakens and undermines the efforts of key states – in particular the United States – to end this war.”</p><p>Zelenskyy spoke after a briefing from Ukraine’s chief of defence intelligence, Oleh Ivashchenko – the recent replacement for Kyrylo Budanov, who was made head of the president’s office. <strong>Budanov on Saturday confirmed his own arrival in the US to discuss peace proposals</strong>. He and Ukrainian negotiators Rustem Umerov and Davyd Arakhamia would meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner and the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, Budanov said. Zelenskyy has tasked his delegation at the Miami talks with finalising proposals about security guarantees and economic recovery. If American officials approve the proposals, the US and Ukraine could sign a deal next week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, according to Zelenskyy. However Russia has given no indication it will accept any peace deal without Ukraine’s entire Donbas region being handed over for a start.</p><p>Russian attacks left at least <strong>two people </strong><strong>dead and others injured in Kharkiv oblast</strong> on Saturday, regional authorities said. A strike that damaged a critical infrastructure facility in Kharkiv city’s industrial district could seriously affect power and heating, said the mayor, Ihor Terekhov, with the energy system “constantly operating at its limits”. One person was wounded in the attack. An attack on a house in Kharkiv city killed a woman aged 20 and wounded others. In the village of Borivske, a 52-year-old woman was killed when a drone hit a public transport stop, prosecutors said. In the Sumy region, emergency services said an airstrike on a residential neighbourhood wounded three women and a seven-year-old child, and left 15 residential buildings damaged.</p><p>Russia struck <strong>energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s Kyiv and Odesa regions</strong> overnight into Saturday, the ministry of energy said. More than 20 settlements in the Kyiv region were left without power. Zelenskyy said Ukraine needed to ramp up the importation of electricity and the acquisition of additional equipment from partners. Officials have instructed state energy companies Ukrzaliznytsia, Naftogaz and Ukroboronprom to <strong>urgently purchase imported electricity covering at least 50% of their own consumption</strong>, according to Denys Shmyhal, the energy minister.</p><p>Shmyhal announced that <strong>Lithuania would be providing Ukraine with more energy generating equipment </strong>for Kyiv and the most critically affected regions, after already supplying equipment for emergency repairs on coal and nuclear power plants. “In addition we have received over 2,000 solar panels, various equipment and machinery from our Lithuanian friends,” Shmyhal said. “Lithuania has contributed €5.7m euros to the energy support fund of Ukraine … There is not a single power plant left in Ukraine that has not been hit by Russian strikes. Ukrainian energy workers continue to repair around the clock and return electricity to people.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/18/ukraine-war-briefing-russia-readying-strikes-on-nuclear-power-system-zelenskyy-warns">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
