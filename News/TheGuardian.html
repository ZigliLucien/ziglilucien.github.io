This live blog is closed</p><p>All Commons Speakers, at least for the past 30 years, have complained about the government making major announcements to the media first, and not to parliament first. But rarely have any of them sounded quite as furious about this as <strong>Lindsay Hoyle</strong>, who this morning delivered an extended reprimand to the government about this at the start of an urgent question.</p><p>The UQ was about plans to limit the use of prison recall – something announced by the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/may/14/keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-pmqs-immigration-energy-assisted-dying-uk-politics-news-live-updates?page=with%3Ablock-6824b1a68f08cde346733c79#block-6824b1a68f08cde346733c79">at a press conference yesterday</a>, while the Commons was still sitting. After pointing this out, and reminding MPs that details of the immigration white paper were given to the media extensively, long before the ministerial statement about it was delivered in the Commons on Monday, Hoyle went on to imply that, as well as regularly breaking the ministerial code, ministers were also guilty of hypocrisy. He said:</p><p>I note that those who now occupy senior ministerial roles were not slow to complain when the previous government made major policy announcements outside this house.</p><p>I will continue to uphold and defend the rights of this house, the rights of backbenchers, to be here, and hear it first, the most important announcements of government policy, and the right of honourable members to question ministers on those announcements in person.</p><p>When Parliament is in session, the most important announcements of government policy should be made in the first instance in Parliament.</p><p>If the government is not going to take the ministerial code seriously, who will?</p><p>I’ve got to say, I don’t like this. I believe I am here to represent all backbenchers and backbenchers have the right to ask questions. I’m not interested in Sky News or the BBC or political programmes. I’m here to defend all of you. I will continue to defend. Please do not take MPs for granted. It is not acceptable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/may/15/keir-starmer-rachel-reeves-economy-nhs-kemi-badenoch-uk-politics-live-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
