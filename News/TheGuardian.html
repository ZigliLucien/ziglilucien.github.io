Here’s what Trump wrote:</p><p>This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didn’t WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn’t WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn’t WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN’T WIN ANYTHING! I WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY. I’m just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!! WE DON’T WANT VICIOUS, VIOLENT, AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS, MANY OF THEM DERANGED MURDERERS, IN OUR COUNTRY. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!</p><p>People in our country illegally can self-deport the easy way, or they can get deported the hard way, and that’s not pleasant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/18/donald-trump-venezuela-deportations-white-house-immigration-us-politics-live">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

They are seismic changes. It’s a whole new world in the global economy and that will impact our own economy and our own Budget.</em></p><p><em>I think as the Productivity Commission made clear today and the OECD made clear overnight as well, two of the consequences of escalating trade tensions are slower growth and higher inflation and, again, it would be strange to conclude that we’d be immune from that.</em></p><p><em>When these tariffs are imposed and when there’s the retaliatory nature of these escalating trade tensions, we do expect higher prices. That’s one of the obvious consequences of tariffs. We’ll see that around the world and we are at risk of seeing it here.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/mar/19/australia-news-live-politics-election-fact-check-meta-budget-tariffs-jim-chalmers-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-ntwnfb">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
