While some opposition parties want Starmer to be more confrontational, Straw told Times Radio that would be a mistake. He said:</p><p>The best approach [to handling Trump] that I know of is the one that’s being adopted by our prime minister, Keir Starmer. It’s very hard. It’s very frustrating. I’m sure there have been occasions where Sir Keir has said things to himself in the shaving mirror about Mr Trump that he would not wish to be repeated. But he is an example of how to handle Donald Trump. It is infinitely better than challenging Trump’s ego, to which there is no limit, trying to work around him.</p><p>And up to now, the Starmer approach to Trump has succeeded, not least in the fact that, until this latest outburst on Greenland, we did have a much better deal on tariffs than, say, the European Union has had.</p><p>The treaty has been signed with the Mauritian government. So I can’t reverse the clock on that. The treaty has been signed. Parliament has a kind of enabling function on treaties. It’s not like a traditional piece of legislation. So it can’t unwind the treaty having been signed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/jan/20/chagos-donald-trump-keir-starmer-greenland-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
