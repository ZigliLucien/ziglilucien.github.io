Trump also refused to commit to deploying US forces to support a European-led peacekeeping force.</p><p><strong>However, Trump reiterated his support for the Nato principle of collective defence under Article 5 of the Nato treaty</strong>. He said “I support it. I don’t think we’re gonna have any reason for it. I think we’re going to have a very successful peace.”</p><p><strong>After their bilateral meeting, Starmer said he had been clear that “the UK is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal.”</strong> He said he was “working closely with other European leaders on this” and that working with allies was “the only way that peace will last”.</p><p><strong>Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign minister, has accused Donald Trump of falling for a Russian narrative by closing the door on Nato membership for Ukraine.</strong> “Why are we in Nato? It is because we are afraid of Russia. And the only thing that really works – the only security guarantee that works – is Nato’s umbrella,” she said.</p><p><strong>Kallas – a former prime minister of Estonia, which borders Russia – also questioned Trump’s approach to a peace deal.</strong> “My question is, why we should give Russia what they want on top of what they have already done – attacking Ukraine, annexing territory, occupying territory, and now offering something on top of it? … Consider here in America that after 9/11 you would have sat down with Osama bin Laden and said ‘OK, what else do you want?’ I mean, it’s unimaginable.”</p><p>Given the tone of her comments, you will be probably somewhat less surprised to learn that her meeting with US counterpart Marco Rubio got <strong>cancelled</strong> at a very late notice due to, erm, “scheduling issues” – only after she landed in the US.</p><p><strong>Russian forces staged mass strikes late on Thursday on energy targets in the Kharkiv region</strong> <strong>of north-eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said</strong>. Oleh Syniehubov said one man was injured in a Russian attack on the town of Balakliia, south-east of Kharkiv. Ukraine’s air force reported threats of attacks by glide bombs and drones in the region.</p><p><strong>North Korea has sent more soldiers to Russia</strong> <strong>and redeployed several to the frontline in Kursk, the South Korean spy agency told Agence France-Presse on Thursday</strong>. “The exact scale is still being assessed,” an official said.</p><p><strong>Nato allies to Ukraine are preparing billions more in aid</strong> <strong>and contributions to security guarantees,</strong> the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, said on Thursday, adding he had had a great talk with Donald Trump.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer">Keir Starmer</a>’s meeting with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> this week comes at a crucial moment for the war in Ukraine and the future of the Nato alliance. <strong>Europe is looking for leaders who can engage Trump</strong> on the future of the continent as the US leader appears more inclined to demand tribute from his allies and cosy up to Vladimir Putin.</em></p><p><em>Can the “special relationship” between the US and the UK save the day?
