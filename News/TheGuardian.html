It did not lack for circus drama or cost, peaking with a billowing Ottoman sailing ship arriving high above the port on wires to be greeted by an angelic-appearing Libyan woman.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/libya-national-museum-reopens">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
