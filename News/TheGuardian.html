Here’s what we know so far:</p><p>Kirk, 31, died after being shot during a presentation on campus. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> first announced the death in a Truth Social post. Trump wrote: “The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife Erika, and family. Charlie, we love you!”</p><p>A person of interest taken into custody on Wednesday afternoon has been released after being interviewed. FBI director <strong>Kash Patel</strong> said the investigation into the attack continued. The Utah governor <strong>Spencer Cox</strong> said at a news conference on Wednesday evening that there was no evidence so far that a second person was involved.</p><p>The first person to be detained at the scene, George Zinn, was deemed not to be a suspect but has been charged with obstructing justice.</p><p>Authorities said the only information they have about about the possible shooter is taken from CCTV on campus. They said the suspect was dressed in dark clothing.</p><p>Utah Valley University police force chief Jeff Long said he could not disclose whether the gun used in the killing had been recovered.</p><p>Cox described the killing as a “political assassination” but did not give details of how he knew the shooter’s motivation.</p><p>Kirk, the executive director of Turning Point USA (TPUSA), was shot at about 12.10pm local time while appearing at an event. In video posts circulating on social media, Kirk can be seen getting struck while speaking and sitting beneath a tent. <a href="https://x.com/Anarseldain/status/1965847654946189339">Video footage</a> shows students on campus running away from the sound of a gunshot.</p><p>Kirk was about 20 minutes into a presentation when a shot was fired from a nearby building, the university told CNBC. The university said a “single shot” was fired towards Kirk.</p><p>Political leaders in the US immediately condemned the attack. <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, the former US president, tweeted: “There is no place in our country for this kind of violence.
