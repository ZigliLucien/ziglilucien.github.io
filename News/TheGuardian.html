She apologised and stood down – a move rarely seen in the country.</p><p>Since then, however, Núñez’s contrition seems to have launched a trend, with a wave of mea culpas from politicians of various parties rushing to revise – downwards – their educational achievements. Some have even resigned, emulating Núñez, who said: “I apologise to anyone who feels disappointed but I also believe it’s not enough to say sorry.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/05/wave-of-spanish-politicians-edit-cvs-over-incorrect-claims-of-degrees-and-diplomas">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
