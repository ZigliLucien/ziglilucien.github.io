Millions of Venezuelans’ lives were thrown into uncertainty. Politicians at home and abroad scrambled to respond. It seemed this was something no one had seen coming.

These platforms allow their users not just to bet on whoever’s going to win the Super Bowl, but also on world events.

That will enable lawmakers to return for negotiations around long-term DHS funding after the killings by federal agents of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.
