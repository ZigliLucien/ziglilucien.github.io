You can read our story on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/judge-blocks-trump-executive-order-trans-military-ban">the US judge’s decision here</a>.</p><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> has called for the impeachment of the judge handling lawsuits over his administration’s deportation of suspected Venezuelan gang members, a significant escalation of rightwing attacks on the judiciary.</p><p>While allies of the president such as <strong>Elon Musk</strong> have repeatedly said judges who rule against him should be impeached, this appears to be the first time the president has backed such calls publicly. Trump’s post <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114183576937425149">on Truth Social</a> does not name the judge, but seems to reference <strong>James Boasberg</strong>, the Washington DC-based justice who was appointed by <strong>Barack Obama</strong> and attempted to prevent the government from deporting the alleged gang members under the Alien Enemies Act. Here’s what Trump wrote:</p><p>This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didn’t WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn’t WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn’t WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN’T WIN ANYTHING! I WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY. I’m just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!! WE DON’T WANT VICIOUS, VIOLENT, AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS, MANY OF THEM DERANGED MURDERERS, IN OUR COUNTRY. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!</p><p>People in our country illegally can self-deport the easy way, or they can get deported the hard way, and that’s not pleasant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/18/donald-trump-venezuela-deportations-white-house-immigration-us-politics-live">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

After weeks of leaks and speculation, in parliament yesterday the work and pensions secretary, Liz Kendall, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/18/britain-welfare-overhaul-disability-benefits-pip-liz-kendall">set out the government’s plan</a> to cut the benefits bill. Her announcement covered a lot of ground, and she said that it was necessary to fix a system that is “failing the very people it is supposed to help and holding the country back”.</p><p>When the dust settled, the consequences of that mission looked stark. In order to claw back £5bn a year by the end of the decade as the UK’s growth prospects worsen, the government is removing benefits for up to 1.2m people with disabilities – and cutting incapacity benefits in favour of a smaller rise for those who are able to seek work. Taken together, the changes are the biggest cuts to welfare since George Osborne was chancellor in 2015.</p><p><em><strong>Ukraine </strong></em>| Vladimir Putin <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/18/trump-and-putin-to-hold-high-stakes-call-on-ukraine">has agreed to a limited ceasefire, halting attacks against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure</a>, after a phone call with Donald Trump.
