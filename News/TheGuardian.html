If he is deported, as so many of the people have articulated today, <strong>he faces death</strong>.</p><p>What happened to him is <strong>the worst kind of abhorrent violation of basic decency</strong>. Put aside the legal causes and the issues here for unmasked agents to snatch someone off the street with no warning, no counsel, no opportunity even to know who is doing it while it’s in process is <strong>un-American</strong>.</p><p>To Zia, we have your back.
