Further north, Death Valley – famously one of the driest places on Earth – received 15mm of rain, triple the average rainfall for September and a full quarter of the yearly average.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/22/weather-tracker-flash-floods-landslides-havoc-california">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

He signs a contract that obliges him to learn English, find work and private accommodation; his access to any income support via universal credit is strictly conditional on him fulfilling its terms. Of all the changes suggested, this one – given that asylum seekers cannot currently work legally – would have the most profound consequences for British politics and the economy.</p><p>Why an asylum-seeker is drawn to Britain over, say, France is not obvious. A 2016 report from Warwick University, based on findings from 29 separate studies into asylum-seeker motives, concluded that social networks and shared languages were crucial. The report could not find a single study showing a significant correlation between work rights and destination choice. If asylum-seekers in Calais were motivated by working rights those who had yet to apply would stay in France, where they could work sooner.</p><p>End the use of asylum hotels by speeding up application processing so thousands aren’t stuck in limbo and those with valid claims can work, integrate and contribute, while those without a right to remain can be returned swiftly.</p><p>Lift the ban on employment for asylum seekers who’ve waited over three months for a decision.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/23/lib-dem-ed-davey-conference-donald-trump-keir-starmer-labour-reform-tory-latest-politics-live-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
