In 2009, I honestly thought it was quite likely that I’d see England win the World Cup in my lifetime. Maybe even by the time I reached the grand old age of 40. In the same year, the Labour government announced HS2, and said that the first phase, from London to Birmingham, would open by 2026. Well, it’s 2025 now, I’m 41, England have just lost 3-1 to Senegal, and yesterday HS2 had its expected completion date <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/18/hs2-delayed-beyond-2033-high-speed-rail">pushed back from 2033</a> to … we’ll get back to you on that.</p><p>By now, it is almost impossible to keep the endless setbacks to the UK’s flagship major infrastructure project straight in your head. But yesterday’s announcement is genuinely significant. On one hand, it reflects years of catastrophic mismanagement, and an even longer wait for the hotly debated benefits of the line to start to be realised. On the other, Labour would like you to believe they are taking a more realistic view than their predecessors, and finally getting a grip on costs that have spiralled further and further out of control.</p><p><em><strong>Middle East </strong></em>| Donald Trump has suggested it would make sense for the US to launch strikes against Iran only if bombing was guaranteed to destroy the Fordow uranium enrichment facility, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/trump-caution-on-iran-strike-linked-to-doubts-over-bunker-buster-bomb-officials-say">according to people familiar with the deliberations</a>.
