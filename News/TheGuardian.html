The actor John Kani paid tribute on X on Sunday, saying “I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend”. The mayor’s office in Cape Town said: “Athol Fugard was not just a luminary in the world of theatre; he was a teller of profound stories of hope and resilience about South Africa.”</p><p>A major political dissident playwright of the 20th century, Fugard wrote more than 30 dramas including Statements After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act (in 1972) and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/02/master-harold-and-the-boys-review-athol-fugard-ballroom-dance-lyttelton">“Master Harold” … and the Boys</a> (1982). Both of those drew upon the time in the 1950s when he could only find employment as a clerk in one of the courts where black South Africans were charged (and inevitably convicted) of breaches of the “pass laws”, designed to control the movements of a racially segregated population under the apartheid system. There, he witnessed hourly the dehumanisation of those who had chosen the “wrong” streets or people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/mar/09/athol-fugard-south-african-political-dissident-playwright-dies-aged-92">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

We welcome the work that has begun to rebuild our welfare system, and we are fully supportive of it.
