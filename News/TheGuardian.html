This was the most powerful storm to strike the island nation, packing winds of up to 185mph at its peak.</p><p>Western parts of Jamaica were worst hit, with 90% of homes in the town of Black River losing their roof or being destroyed entirely. Roughly three-quarters of the country lost electricity, with at least 19 people known to have lost their lives at the time of publication. The cleanup operation was hampered by thunderstorms even after Melissa cleared to the north. The hurricane continued northwards, but was a slightly weakened category 3 storm by the time it made landfall in Cuba. Nonetheless, the storm continued to bring winds of up to 120mph and torrential rains.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/31/weather-tracker-hurricane-melissa-caribbean-jamaica-haiti-cuba">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

That’s a big step forward in terms of the environmental management of native forestry. But it doesn’t go as far as what the Greens party is seeking in being an all-out ban.</p><p>Not in its own right. We haven’t taken the approach of saying that particular projects are altogether banned. Every project will be assessed on its merits whether it be a coal and gas project, whether it be a housing and renewable project, they have all got to demonstrate they’re not having a significant impact on one of the nine matters of national environmental significance under the act.</p><p>If a coal or gas development was seeking approval, then it would need to meet the national environmental standards. It would need to avoid and minimise its environmental impacts and offset them to achieve a net gain. So they would be improvements compared to the criteria that apply to a project at the moment. If it was considered to have an unacceptable impact on the environment then it would get knocked back as would a housing development or a renewable project.</p><p>We’re not trying to sort of put in particular criteria for particular sectors. What we’re trying to do is put in a balanced package for all sorts of projects, for all industries, that deliver environmental and business gains.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/nov/02/nationals-net-zero-party-room-meeting-coalition-labor-murray-watt-anthony-albanese-apec-mark-butler-medicare-bulk-billing-ntwnfb">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
