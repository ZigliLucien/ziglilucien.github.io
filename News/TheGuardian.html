It’s a bad economic decision. It’s bad for our relationship. It’s bad for the US, ultimately, because we think that the exports we send to them - which are significantly less than the exports they send to us - are good for the US economy. They’re good for US industry. They’re particularly good for defence, which is an important area of cooperation.</p><p>We think this is a bad decision that’s disappointing, and we’ll continue to press the case for it.</p><p>We’ve only been going at this for almost seven weeks that President Trump has been back in office. We intend to continue to press the case at the highest level – particularly ambassador Rudd has been relentless in this, meeting with officials almost constantly to press the American case. We’ve had a lot of senior ministerial engagement.</p><p>Obviously the prime minister has spoken directly with the president. We’ll continue to do that. It’s not only in Australia’s interest – which for us, is the most important thing – we’re confident, we’re very sure it’s in both of our interests’ interest to continue the open trade that has characterised particularly the last 20 years under the US FTA.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/mar/12/australia-news-live-beach-erosion-election-labor-coalition-poll-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-ntwnfb">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
