Why cut off research funding? Sure, it hurts Harvard, but it hurts the country because after all, the <strong>research funding is not a gift</strong>. The research funding is given to universities and other research institutions to carry out work – research work – that <strong>the federal government designates as high-priority work</strong>. <strong>It is work that they want done</strong>. They are paying to have that work conducted. <strong>Shutting off that work does not help the country</strong>, even as it punishes Harvard, and <strong>it is hard to see the link between that and, say, antisemitism</strong>.</p><p>I would say that the federal government has the authority through the budgeting process to reallocate funds. But the question to ask is <strong>what problem is [Trump] trying to solve by doing that?</strong> The money that goes to research universities in the form of grants and contracts, which is almost all of the federal support that we get, is used to pay for work that <strong>we perform at the behest of the government</strong>. So in reallocating to some other use, including trade schools, it means that work just won’t be performed. So the right question is, <strong>is this the most effective use of federal funding?</strong> Do you really want to cut back on research dollars? I’m less concerned about whether it goes to a trade school or if it goes to some other project, like working on highways. The real question is, <strong>how much value does the federal government get from its expenditures on research? There is a lot of actual research demonstrating the returns to the American people have been enormous.</strong></p><p>I would say that <strong>we need to be firm in our commitments to what we stand for</strong>. And what we stand for – I believe I speak for other universities – is <strong>education</strong>, <strong>pursuit of the truth</strong>, <strong>helping to educate people for better futures</strong>. And hopefully our own students, after they graduate from our institutions, go out and serve the world. In the end, we’re about <strong>producing and disseminating knowledge and serving our nation and our world</strong>. <strong>When we fail in that, then we can expect to be attacked</strong>. So number one, I think we all need to <strong>redouble our commitment to the good of the nation and the world</strong>. And I know my fellow leaders fully embrace that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/may/27/donald-trump-bribery-pardon-sheriff-tariffs-harvard-ukraine-us-politics-live-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
