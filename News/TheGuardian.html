It was an unequivocal warning from an intelligence source that the war would start that night. We discussed it among the Guardian’s Ukraine reporting team and international editors. My colleague Emma Graham-Harrison, who was on an overnight train from Kyiv towards the frontline city of Mariupol, decided she would get off halfway, in the middle of the night, and beg a spot on the first train heading back to Kyiv. It turned out to be a wise move: Mariupol was soon under siege and the scene of much of the worst carnage of the war. Emma remained in Kyiv, part of our team covering the initial Russian attack on the capital.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/25/nobody-believed-that-putin-would-invade-ukraine-four-years-on-has-europe-learned-from-the-failures-of-2022">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
