 Derek Harris learned in January that BT was planning to remove the K6-style box in Sharrington, Norfolk, where he has lived for 50 years.<br><br>
 Harris and his fellow campaigners argued it was “an iconic heritage asset” and a vital asset to the community, due to the poor mobile signal in the rural area and North Norfolk having the highest proportion of older residents in England and Wales.<br><br>
 On Monday, BT informed Harris it had decided not to withdraw the payphone.<br><br>
 In a letter, the company said: “Given the poor mobile service in the area and the significant number of calls made from this payphone, it is clear that it serves an important function for the community. Therefore, we are withdrawing it from the removal programme.<br><br>
 “We understand the importance of maintaining reliable communication options, especially in areas where mobile service is lacking. The payphone has proven to be a vital resource for residents, ensuring that they have access to emergency services and can stay connected.<br><br>
 “Our decision reflects our commitment to supporting the community’s needs and ensuring that essential services remain accessible.”<br><br>
 Harris was born in 1935, the same year that the K6 style of red phone box was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. It went into production in 1936, becoming a familiar sight across the UK in just a few years.</p><p>Linda Jennings, from Brinton and Sharrington parish council, said: “It’s fantastic, the ‘normal man’ has won over the big company. We are all very pleased. It’s really good that BT has backed down.<br><br>
 “The mobile phone signal is really poor, it’s a lifeline for people. If you can’t get a signal there, you need these phone boxes. We have a parish council meeting on Thursday, Derek will get a big pat on the back.”<br><br>
 Last month, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/27/battle-save-last-phone-box-norfolk-village">Harris told the Guardian of the need for the phone box to remain</a>. <br><br>
 “We live next to perhaps the most beautiful part of Norfolk, the tranquil Glaven Valley with a pure chalk stream running through it,” he said. “It attracts ramblers, walkers, the lot, and everyone knows that there’s a working kiosk.”<br><br>
 In the event of an emergency and the mobile network being down, he added, “Wouldn’t it be awful if someone said: ‘If only they had kept that working kiosk’?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/24/no-change-needed-campaigner-saves-his-last-local-phone-box">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
