Nuzzi, if you’ve fallen behind, developed romantic feelings for the then presidential candidate, now Trump health minister, while profiling him for the magazine and since I’ve had to read this sentence, you do too: “He was exhausted, and he threw himself onto the bed, his pink shirt unbuttoned, revealing my favorite parts of his chest.” If you have a favourite part of RFK Jr’s chest, or consider chests in general subject to preference by localised area, this may be the book for you.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/05/digested-week-olivia-nuzzi-book-robert-f-kennedy-jr-david-dimbleby">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
