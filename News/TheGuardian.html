You can read her account here:</p><p>The <strong>Trump</strong> plan calls for <strong>Israel</strong> to maintain an open-ended military presence inside <strong>Gaza</strong>, along its border with Israel. An international force, comprised largely of <strong>troops from Arab and Muslim countries</strong>, would be responsible for security inside Gaza. The <strong>US</strong> would lead a large internationally funded reconstruction effort, reports the Associated Press (AP).<br><br>
 The plan envisions an eventual role for the <strong>Palestinian Authority</strong> – something Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> has long opposed. But it requires the authority, which administers parts of the <strong>West Bank</strong>, to undergo a sweeping reform programme that could take years.<br><br>
 According to the AP, the <strong>Trump</strong> plan is even more vague about a future <strong>Palestinian state</strong>, which Netanyahu firmly rejects.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/11/israel-gaza-ceasefire-hamas-hostages-netanyahu-trump-middle-east-latest-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
