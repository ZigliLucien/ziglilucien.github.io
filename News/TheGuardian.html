Here are the main points he made about the welfare bill U-turn.</p><p><strong>Kinnock rejected claims that the U-turn was a sign of weakness. </strong>When it was put to him on the Today programme that this move, coming after the U-turns on winter fuel payments and a national inquiry into grooming gangs, showed that if Keir Starmer was pushed, he would give in, Kinnock replied:</p><p>I think if you talk to people out there in the country, they respond very positively to politicians listening, engaging, recognising that you don’t get everything right from day one every time, and making the adjustments and the changes that are needed.</p><p>And this prime minister will always put the country first. He puts country before party, and he does the right thing for the country.</p><p><strong>He defended having a “staggered” approach to changing benefit rules. </strong>Asked about the Tory claim that the government was creating a “two-tier benefits system” (see<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jun/27/welfare-bill-cuts-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-685e40c68f0859b572b5f15a#block-685e40c68f0859b572b5f15a"> 8.30am</a>), he replied:</p><p>Whenever you bring forward change to a complex system, you always have to decide between do you make the change for everybody that’s in that system, in one big move, or do you do it in a more staggered way? What’s clear from the announcement today is that it’s going to be a more staggered process.</p><p><strong>He declined to say how much the U-turn would cost. </strong>He told Times Radio:</p><p>The full details around what we are laying out, what I’ve summarised really today, is going to be laid out in parliament, and then the chancellor will set out the budget in the autumn the whole of the fiscal position and this will be an important part of that.</p><p><strong>He said he was now confident that the UC and Pip bill will pass its second reading on Tuesday.</strong></p><p>All of the MPs I’ve spoken to who signed the reasoned amendment – MPs from across the party, not just on the left – are sticking to their position because we understand that we are answerable to our constituents.</p><p>If the government doesn’t pull the bill, doesn’t consult properly with disabled people and come back to MPs with a serious proposal that protects the dignity of disabled people, I will vote against and I will be far from the only one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jun/27/welfare-bill-cuts-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
