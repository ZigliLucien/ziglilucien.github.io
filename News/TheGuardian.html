Whether he’s the person to lead the Scottish Conservatives is obviously for MSPs, for the membership, to decide.</p><p>What I’m very clear about is that those with disabilities, other minorities and the people of Lothian need a voice for people to hear what we require within our country.</p><p>I’m not sure any party is actually offering that at the moment but whether I stand or not I’ll come to a view in the next few weeks.</p><p>It’s the party that’s moved, not me.</p><p>We are disappointed to read these comments but grateful for Jeremy’s service and wish him well.</p><p>The Scottish Conservatives, under Russell Findlay’s leadership, recognise that many people feel completely disconnected from politics. It is absolutely critical that our party continues to champion commonsense Conservative values and policies that focus on the issues of concern to hard-working Scots.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2025/aug/22/asylum-hotels-labour-immigration-protests-conservatives-kemi-badenoch-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
