Will this approach gain traction in the UK?</p><p>Good morning. In 2023, Nigel Farage went on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/20/nigel-farage-andrew-tate-important-voice-men-podcast-interview">podcast</a> to decry what he described as a culture of “welfarism” in the UK, insisting it was making millions of people in the country lazy. “‘I’m too fat, I’m too stupid, I’m too lazy, I don’t get out of bed in the morning. I smoke drugs, give me money’,” he said. “‘I don’t need to work, the state will provide for me’ … We cannot afford it.”</p><p>Less than two years later, the self-styled free-market crusader seems to be singing a different tune.
