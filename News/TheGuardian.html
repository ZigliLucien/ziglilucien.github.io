Faced with a revanchist Russia, Europe’s security feels less certain now than at any time since the second world war. And the threat of even higher US tariffs is ever present.</p><p>But it’s also important to ensure our special relationship includes being open and honest with each other. At times, this means being a critical friend and speaking truth to power – and being clear that we reject the politics of fear and division. Showing President Trump why he must back Ukraine, not Putin. Making the case for taking the climate emergency seriously. Urging the president to stop the tariff wars that are tearing global trade apart. And putting pressure on him to do much more to end Israel’s horrific onslaught on Gaza, as only he has the power to bring Israel’s brazen and repeated violations of international law to an end.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/17/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-king-charles-windsor-politics-latest-news-updates-labour-keir-starmer">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
