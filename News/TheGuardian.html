Waiting times cut for every single person in this country. That’s national renewal, that’s a Britain built for all.</p><p>In decades to come, I want people to look back on this moment as the moment we renewed the NHS for a new world.</p><p>The online hospital will be accessible through the NHS app – which is a central part of Labour’s drive to create an NHS fit for the future. That drive has seen an extra five million NHS appointments delivered since Labour came to office.</p><p>Patients will always have the choice between NHS Online and their local hospital. Those who opt in to the service will also access and track prescriptions, be referred for scans and tests, and receive clinical advice on managing their condition – all from the comfort of their own home.</p><p>University Hospital Southampton’s outpatient clinics were overwhelmed with follow-up appointments for patients with low-risk inflammatory bowel disease flare-ups. They developed a virtual follow-up pathway, enabling patients to access care remotely and initiate follow-up when needed, rather than being booked into routine slots. They used digital tools to monitor their symptoms and support decision-making. This led to a 73% reduction in consultant-led outpatient appointments, over 75% of patients managed virtually, and a 58% reduction in waiting times.</p><p>Moorfields Eye Hospital identified issues with long waits for referrals to be reviewed, causing anxiety and distress for patients waiting for care. They introduced a Single Point of Access for virtual triage across multiple providers with all referrals coming into a single shared system. Staff assessed each referral digitally to quickly decide what kind of care was needed and where it should happen, with patients prioritised if urgent, directed to the right clinic if routine, or promptly informed if a referral wasn’t appropriate. Referral processing time reduced from 11 hours to two, with 58% of urgent referrals safely downgraded to routine clinics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/30/labour-conference-starmer-speech-streeting-nhs-reform">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
