 A report by the judiciary news website Mizanonline identified the alleged spy as <strong>Rouzbeh Vadi</strong>, who was accused of relaying classified information to Israel’s intelligence service, <strong>the Mossad</strong>. <br><br>
 Authorities said Vadi provided information about an Iranian nuclear scientist who was killed during Israel’s June airstrikes on Iran, according to the report, which did not identify the scientist or the time and place of Vadi’s arrest.<br><br>
 Vadi met the Mossad officers five times in <strong>Vienna</strong>, <strong>Austria</strong>, the report said.<br><br>
 Israel’s ambassador to <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Joshua Zarka</strong>, said in June that Israel’s 12-day war on Iran included targeted strikes that killed at least 14 physicists and engineers involved with Iran’s nuclear programme.<br><br>
 Iran has hanged seven people for espionage during the conflict with Israel, sparking fears from activists that the government could conduct a wave of executions.<br><br>
 Iran separately hanged a man they said was a member of IS on Wednesday after he was convicted of plotting sabotage, Mizanonline reported. Officials accused <strong>Mehdi Asgharzadeh</strong> of participating in military training in <strong>Syria</strong> and <strong>Iraq</strong> before illegally entering Iran with a four-member team who were killed in a fight with Iranian security, the news site reported.<br><br>
 Authorities said Iran’s supreme court upheld the sentences of lower courts and followed full legal procedures before executing both men, Mizanonline reported.</p><p>The Guardian was granted permission on Tuesday to travel onboard a <strong>Jordanian</strong> military aircraft providing aid. <strong>Israel</strong> announced last week that it had resumed coordinated humanitarian airdrops over <strong>Gaza</strong>, following mounting international pressure over severe shortages of food and medical supplies, which has reached such a crisis point that a famine is now unfolding there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/aug/06/middle-east-crisis-live-aid-truck-gaza-israel-netanyahu-latest-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
