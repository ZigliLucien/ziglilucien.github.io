 A lawyer for Sorcha Eastwood, an MP for the Alliance party, said the posts were made on Friday, the day after she had told MPs that she was a “survivor of abuse” and had received rape threats.<br><br>
 Kevin Winters, one of Northern Ireland’s best-known solicitors with a series of cases against the state in relation to deaths during the Troubles, confirmed he was acting for the MP. <br><br>
 “We are instructed to issue legal proceedings against Andrew and Tristan Tate over their continued publication of social media postings on 10 January 2025,” he said. <br>
 “We can confirm service of correspondence on today’s date to their solicitors. In light of the sensitivities of the issues engaged, we have no further comment at this stage.”<br><br>
 The posts that prompted Eastwood to launch the legal action were made on social media the day after a debate on violence against women and girls in the House of Commons.</p><p>Eastwood’s lawyer did not provide details of the claim but Tate’s timeline shows he commented on Friday on posts she had made in October about male role models.
