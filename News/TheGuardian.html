Here’s a recap of what happened this morning.</p><p><strong>Russia attacked Ukraine with Russian ballistic missiles and drones</strong> during a nighttime attack early on Friday, wounding at least three people, officials said.</p><p><strong>Multiple explosions were heard in Kyiv,</strong> the capital, and falling debris triggered fires across several districts as air defence systems tried to intercept incoming targets, said the Kyiv city administration’s head, Tymur Tkachenko.</p><p><strong>Authorities reported damage in several districts</strong> and rescue workers were responding at multiple locations. Officials urged residents to seek shelter.</p><p><strong>The attacks came after Russia accused Kyiv of state terrorism</strong> over its drone operation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/02/operation-spiderweb-visual-guide-ukraine-drone-attack-russian-aircraft">striking Russian heavy bomber planes</a> at air bases in Siberia and the far north at the weekend and said it would respond as and when its military saw fit.</p><p><strong>In Friday’s Russian attacks a fire broke out in a 16-story residential building in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district</strong> and emergency services evacuated three people from the apartment. Rescue operations were continuing. Another fire broke out in a metal warehouse.</p><p><strong>A Shahed drone exploded near an apartment building in Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region</strong>, shattering windows and doors, the regional military administration chief said. Explosions from ballistic missiles were also recorded on the city’s outskirts, Dmytro Bryzhynskyi added.</p><p><strong>US president Donald Trump said that during a call with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday he urged the Russian president to refrain from retaliating</strong> but fully expected Moscow to strike back over Ukraine’s assault on Russian heavy bomber planes.</p><p><strong>The UN nuclear safety watchdog’s team at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine heard repeated rounds of gunfire</strong> that appeared to be aimed at drones reportedly attacking the site’s training centre, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Thursday. There were no immediate reports of damage to the centre, it said.</p><p><strong>German chancellor Friedrich Merz urged Trump in an Oval Office meeting to increase pressure on Russia</strong> to end the war.</p><p><strong>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un vowed to “unconditionally support” Russia</strong> in the war at a meeting with top Russian security official Sergei Shoigu, Pyongyang state media reported.<br><em>With agencies</em></p><p>How and when our military deems it appropriate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/06/ukraine-war-live-update-russia-kyiv-drone-air-attack-putin-zelenskyy-latest-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
