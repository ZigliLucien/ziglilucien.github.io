In an interview on Newsnight last night, <strong>Bridget Phillipson</strong>, the education secretary standing against Powell, said a Powell victory would be “destabilising” for the party. She said:</p><p>[Electing Powell] risks destabilising the party … we best achieve what we need to do together when we have those fierce conversations, including disagreements, behind closed doors.</p><p>Members need to understand that there’s a potential challenge around all of that – that if you’re not inside when the big decisions are being made, you’re not at that table, you’re not in those conversations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/08/conservative-tory-conference-kemi-badenoch-labour-keir-starmer-india-uk-politics-live-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
