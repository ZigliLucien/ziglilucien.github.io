When Justin Trudeau announced he would be resigning as Canada’s prime minister in January, he did so amid surging support for the Conservative opposition and a sense that its Trump-adjacent leader, Pierre Poilievre, might be the right candidate for a new political era. The Liberals’ near-decade in power appeared to be close to an end.</p><p>Now, Trudeau’s successor, the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/23/canada-to-head-to-polls-as-mark-carney-calls-snap-election-for-28-april">has called a snap general election</a> against a dramatically different political backdrop. With Donald Trump’s tariff war and musings about Canada’s future as a 51st state the inescapable mood music, many voters who had given up on the Liberals appear ready to give them another hearing – and Poilievre is trying to distance himself from the president whose methods he was once so happy to adopt.</p><p><em><strong>Trump administration</strong></em> | A catastrophic security leak triggered outrage in US politics after senior Trump administration officials accidentally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/journalist-trump-yemen-war-chat-reaction">broadcast highly sensitive military plans through a Signal group chat</a> with a journalist reading along.
