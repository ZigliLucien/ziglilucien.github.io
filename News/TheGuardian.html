 Trump spoke on Friday shortly after secretary of state <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> warned that the US may “move on” from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days, after months of efforts have failed to bring an end to the fighting.<br><br>
 The US president said:</p><p>Now, if for some reason, one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we’re just going to say you’re foolish. You are fools, you horrible people.</p><p>And we’re going to just take a pass. But hopefully, we won’t have to do that.</p><p><strong>Russia and Ukraine will conduct a new prisoner swap on Saturday mediated by the United Arab Emirates, a source close to the negotiations told Reuters.</strong> Nearly 500 Russian and Ukrainian prisoners and 46 injured soldiers will be exchanged in the latest swap to be mediated by Abu Dhabi. The exchange will involve 246 prisoners from each side, the source said.</p><p><strong>Ukraine imposed sanctions on three Chinese companies on Friday, claiming they were involved in the production of advanced Iskander missiles.</strong> The sanctions list, which also includes Russian companies, names Beijing Aviation &amp; Aerospace Xianghui Technology, Rui Jin Machinery and Zhongfu Shenying Carbon Fiber Xining, all registered in China.</p><p><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on X: “Today, we have expanded our Ukrainian sanctions against nearly a hundred more entities</strong> – natural and legal persons – most of whom are involved in the production of such missiles – Iskanders – like those that struck our Kharkiv. Many of these entities are Russian, but unfortunately, some are also from China.” On Thursday, Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/18/china-dismisses-zelenskyy-claim-supply-weapons-russia">accused China of supplying Russia with artillery and gunpowder</a>, which Beijing has denied.</p><p><strong>Russia launched 8 missiles and 87 drones in an overnight attack on Ukraine on Saturday, causing damage in five regions across the country</strong>, the Ukrainian air force said.</p><p><strong>The Guardian has obtained the memorandum of intent signed by Ukraine and the US over a minerals deal.</strong> It envisages setting up a joint investment fund between the two countries and lays out a deadline of 26 April to finalise negotiations. The document recognises the “significant financial and material support” Washington has given Kyiv since Russia’s full-scale 2022 invasion.</p><p><strong>The US is prepared to recognise Russian control of the Ukrainian region of Crimea as part of a broader peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv</strong>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-18/us-open-to-recognizing-crimea-as-russian-in-ukraine-peace-deal">Bloomberg News has reported</a>, citing people familiar with the matter. According to Bloomberg, the people said a final decision on the matter hadn’t yet been taken, and the White House and state department did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p><strong>Australia will use “whatever avenues” it can to help Melbourne man Oscar Jenkins, who faces a 15-year jail term in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> for fighting with Ukrainian troops. </strong>The prime minister said on Saturday that the government would “continue to make representations to the reprehensible regime of Vladimir Putin” to release Jenkins, 33, a former teacher who fought with Ukraine’s armed forces against Russia’s invasion.<br></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/apr/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-trump-putin-zelenskyy-peace-talks-latest-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
