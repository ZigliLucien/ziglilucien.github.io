I’m a humble cabinet minister.</p><p>Of course a meeting with the president is always a good thing. But I’ll tell you what’s even more important is results. I’d much rather Anthony Albanese get a great result for our economy with the world’s lowest tariff without a meeting, than to have a meeting and get the opposite result, which is what many other world leaders have found themselves in that situation.</p><p>Well, we obviously have set Australia’s foreign policy based on our interests and our values. And while everyone is entitled to their views, we will determine Australian foreign policy, not anyone else. And we’ve determined a couple of things – that the time is right, in concert, as you said, with like-minded states.</p><p>We have been waiting 80 years for a two-state solution, and that we now see recognising Palestine as a step towards a two-state solution, not the result of negotiations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/sep/21/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-donald-trump-new-york-sunday-ntwnfb">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
