Trump’s post <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114183576937425149">on Truth Social</a> does not name the judge, but seems to reference <strong>James Boasberg</strong>, the Washington DC-based justice who was appointed by <strong>Barack Obama</strong> and attempted to prevent the government from deporting the alleged gang members under the Alien Enemies Act. Here’s what Trump wrote:</p><p>This Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, was not elected President - He didn’t WIN the popular VOTE (by a lot!), he didn’t WIN ALL SEVEN SWING STATES, he didn’t WIN 2,750 to 525 Counties, HE DIDN’T WIN ANYTHING! I WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY. I’m just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do. This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!! WE DON’T WANT VICIOUS, VIOLENT, AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS, MANY OF THEM DERANGED MURDERERS, IN OUR COUNTRY. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!</p><p>People in our country illegally can self-deport the easy way, or they can get deported the hard way, and that’s not pleasant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/18/donald-trump-venezuela-deportations-white-house-immigration-us-politics-live">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
