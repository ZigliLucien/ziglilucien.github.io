 This package will preserve the social security system for those who need it by putting it on a sustainable footing, provide dignity for those unable to work, supports those who can and reduce anxiety for those currently in the system.<br><br>
 Our reforms are underpinned by Labour values and our determination to deliver the change the country voted for last year.</p><p>Dear colleague,<br><br>
 We have always said we are determined to reform the social security system so it is fair, provides dignity and respect for those unable to work, supports those who can, and is sustainable so it is there for generations to come.<br><br>
 The broken system we inherited from the Tories fails all of those tests.<br><br>
 These important reforms are rooted in Labour values, and we want to get them right.<br><br>
 We have listened to colleagues who support the principle of reform but are worried about the impact of the pace of change on those already supported by the system.<br><br>
 As a result we will make two changes to strengthen the bill.<br><br>
 Firstly, we recognise the proposed changes have been a source of uncertainty and anxiety.<br><br>
 Therefore, we will ensure that all of those currently receiving Pip will stay within the current system. The new eligibility requirements will be implemented from November 2026 for new claims only.<br><br>
 Secondly, we will adjust the pathway of universal credit payment rates to make sure all existing recipients of the UC health element – and any new claimant meeting the severe conditions criteria – have their incomes fully protected in real terms.<br><br>
 Colleagues rightly want to ensure that disabled people and those with ill health are at the heart of our reforms.<br><br>
 We will take forward a ministerial review of the Pip assessment, led by the minister for social security and disability [Stephen Timms], to ensure the benefit is fair and fit for the future.<br><br>
 At the heart of this review will be coproduction with disabled people, the organisations that represent them, and MPs so their views and voices are heard. The review will then report to me as work and pensions secretary.<br><br>
 These commitments sit alongside our raising of the standard rate of the universal credit – the biggest real-terms permanent increase of any benefit since the 1980s – the protection of the incomes of the most vulnerable who will no longer be reassessed and the introduction of “right to try”.<br><br>
 Our reform principles remain; to target funding for those most in need and make sure the system is sustainable for the future to support generations to come.<br><br>
 We believe those who can work, should, and those who cannot, should be protected.<br><br>
 We will front load more of the additional funding generated by these reforms for back to work support for sick and disabled people.<br><br>
 Taken together it is a fair package that will preserve the social security system for those who need it by putting it on a sustainable footing, support people back into work, protect those who cannot work and reduce anxiety for those currently in the system.<br><br>
 Thank you to colleagues for engaging with us on these important reforms to social security.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jun/27/welfare-bill-cuts-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
