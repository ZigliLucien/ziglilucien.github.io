In south-east China, temperatures have climbed steadily since late September under the influence of higher than average pressure to the north-east, reaching the mid-to-high 30Cs during a period when conditions would normally be cooling from about 30C to the mid-20s. Inland areas have neared 40C (104F), with Xiushui, in Jiangxi province, recording 38.9C on Wednesday, about 13C above average for early October.</p><p>Overnight warmth has also persisted. In Hong Kong, further heat on Wednesday brought October’s tally of “very hot days” – defined by temperatures remaining above 28C throughout the day – to four, the highest ever recorded for the month.
