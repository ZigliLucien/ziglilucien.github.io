Think White Lotus on Lake Como, art directed by Slim Aarons. First on to the pebbled catwalk weaving through the hotel’s terrace was a white bathrobe-style coat. Then there were capri pants in the butter yellow of the hotel parasols, and a lilac tweed suit to match the wisteria trailing overhead. Models swung tote bags big enough for pool towels, while gold lamé cover-ups glinted as dazzling as sun on the lake.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/apr/29/chanel-takes-a-cruise-around-lake-como-with-glamour-fit-for-a-grand-hotel">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote><p>New accreditation for PAs and anaesthesia associates is ‘important milestone’ for patient assurance, regulator says</p><p>More than 1,000 physician associates (PAs) could begin their careers in the NHS every year after regulators approved dozens of courses to teach them.<br><br>
 The General Medical Council (GMC) said it had given 36 courses formal approval to teach PAs and anaesthesia associates (AAs).<br><br>
 Overall, these courses had capacity for up to 1,059 PAs and 42 AAs to qualify each year.<br><br>
 The GMC said approving training courses would mean that “patients, employers and colleagues can be assured that PAs and AAs have the required knowledge and skills to practise safely once they qualify”.<br><br>
 PAs are graduates – usually with a health or life sciences degree – who have undertaken two years of postgraduate training.<br><br>
 According to the NHS, PAs work under the supervision of a doctor and can diagnose people, take medical histories, perform physical examinations, see patients with long-term conditions, analyse test results and develop management plans.<br><br>
 There were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/mar/28/physician-associates-must-be-supervised-by-gps-says-nhs-england">calls for more clarity in the PA role and better patient protection</a> after the death of Emily Chesterton, 30, in November 2022 from a pulmonary embolism.<br><br>
 Chesterton was misdiagnosed by a PA in London on two occasions who said her calf pain was a sprain, when she actually had a blood clot.<br><br>
 Most associates work in GP surgeries, acute medicine and emergency medicine while AAs work as part of the anaesthesia and wider surgical team.<br><br>
 The GMC, which took over the regulation of PAs and AAs in December, said it had approved 33 PA courses.<br><br>
 Four of these – at Bradford, Greater Manchester, Queen Mary University of London and Sheffield Hallam – had been approved with “conditions” after some concerns were identified during the approval process.<br><br>
 The GMC said each of these courses had a “targeted action plan” in place to address concerns.<br><br>
 The regulator did not approve the course at the University of East London.<br><br>
 There are only three courses for AAs – in Birmingham, University College London and Lancaster – that were all approved, the GMC said.<br><br>
 Prof Colin Melville, the GMC’s medical director and director of education and standards, said: “This is an important milestone in the regulation of PAs and AAs and will provide assurance, now and in the future, that those who qualify in these roles have the appropriate skills and knowledge that patients rightly expect and deserve.<br><br>
 “As a regulator, patient safety is paramount, and we have a robust quality assurance process for PA and AA courses, as we do for medical schools. We have been engaging with course providers for several years already, and we only grant approval where they meet our high standards.”<br><br>
 In November, Wes Streeting, the health and social care secretary, announced an independent review of the PA and AA professions led by Prof Gillian Leng, the president of the Royal Society of Medicine.<br><br>
 Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers, said: “The formal accreditation of the courses of study that PAs and AAs must complete is an essential component of regulation and public safety.<br><br>
 “We await the outcome of the Leng review but recognise that individual NHS organisations also have a responsibility to support PAs and AAs to both use their knowledge safely with patients, and to ensure appropriate professional development and supervision.”<br><br>
 Prof Phil Banfield, the council chair at the British Medical Association, said it was “difficult to understand” how the GMC could approve the courses when the Leng review into PAs and AAs has not concluded.<br><br>
 He added: “The medical profession has alarming worries about the quality and robustness of these courses, with reports of exams with 100% pass rates.<br><br>
 “We have made doctors’ concerns clear in our submission to the Leng review, which includes a call for an independent body of doctors, without links to course providers, to determine proportionate and safe expectations of what can be covered in curricula for assistant roles within a two-year training period.”</p><p><em>PA Media contributed to this report</em><br></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/30/gmc-approves-36-courses-to-teach-more-than-1000-nhs-physician-associates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote><p>Forecasters say temperature could soar to 30C later this week, the earliest date the high would have been reached</p><p>The UK experienced its hottest day of the year so far on Tuesday and temperatures could reach 30C at the earliest point on record later this week, forecasters said.<br><br>
 The highest temperature recorded on Tuesday was 24.9C in Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire, according to the Met Office.<br><br>
 The previous hottest day this year was 24.5C recorded in St James’s Park, London, on Monday.<br><br>
 The Met Office, which warned last month that the climate crisis is pushing temperature extremes to new levels, said temperatures could hit 27C or 28C on Wednesday in southern England and the Midlands.<br><br>
 In a further sign of the changing climate, Wales could also set a new record for its highest April temperature – currently 26.2C.<br><br>
 Meteorologist Craig Snell said the most likely places to see the warmest weather on Wednesday were “in a line from London over towards the West Country and into the Midlands”.<br><br>
 Snell told the PA news agency: “The central southern parts of the UK are probably going to be where the highest temperatures will be tomorrow.”<br><br>
 He said Thursday would be “the peak of the heat”, adding: “We are likely to see 28C or 29C, and again it’s going to be a corridor from the west of London over towards Bristol which will probably be the most likely places to see the highest temperatures.”<br><br>
 The meteorologist said the high temperatures on Thursday would result in one of the “warmest starts to May on record”.<br><br>
 Met Office chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said April temperatures in the mid-20s were “not particularly unusual” but added: “It is more unusual to see temperatures reach the high 20s, and if we see 30C this week, it will be the earliest point in the year in which we have achieved that threshold.”<br><br>
 Temperatures are forecast to drop across much of the UK on Friday as the high pressure starts to pull away.<br><br>
 The highest recorded April temperature was in 1949, when Camden Square, London, recorded 29.4C.<br><br>
 The London fire brigade (LFB) has urged caution around open-water swimming after last month saw a 32% increase in water-related incidents compared with the same period last year.<br><br>
 Craig Carter, the LFB’s assistant commissioner for prevention and protection, said: “Even when the sun is shining, water temperatures can be dangerously cold. Cold water shock can affect anyone, no matter how fit or experienced they are.<br><br>
 “It can lead to water inhalation and, in the worst cases, drowning. Be particularly careful near the water’s edge – it’s easy to slip and fall unexpectedly. And think twice before jumping into open water.”<br><br>
 Research this month found that the number of UK homes overheating in summer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/16/uk-homes-overheating-soars-study">quadrupled to 80%</a> over the past decade. <br><br>
 The study also found that the use of air conditioning soared sevenfold to 21% of homes between 2011 and 2022. The researchers warned that continuation of this trend could put strain on the national electricity grid, increase carbon emissions and fuel social disadvantage among families unable to afford air conditioning.<br><br>
 The research was prompted by extreme heatwaves in 2022, when temperatures in the UK rose above 40C for the first time. The past two years have been the hottest on record globally, driven by the burning of fossil fuels.<br><br>
 More than 10,000 people have died as a result of summer heatwaves from 2020 to 2024, data from the UK Health Security Agency shows.<br><br>
 The huge rise in overheated homes and air conditioner use was “a shocking result”, said Dr Mehri Khosravi at the University of East London, who led the study. She added: “Over the heatwaves experienced in 2022 we had nearly 4,500 dead, but this excess mortality is hidden.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/29/uk-records-hottest-day-of-year-so-far-as-mercury-hits-249c">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
