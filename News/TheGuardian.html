In fact, he’s perhaps uniquely positioned to apply that pressure to Israel to ensure that there is safe passage for humanitarian aid to support the people of Gaza, who face an absolutely unbearable set of circumstances as a consequence of the conflict.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/28/starmer-trump-meeting-gaza-trade-palestine-latest-live-uk-politics-updates-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
