In a statement its DWP spokesperson at Westminster, <strong>Ann Davies</strong>, said:</p><p>Liz Kendall claims the UK government is working toward a “fairer, more compassionate benefits system,” yet there is neither fairness nor compassion in protecting existing claimants while penalising those who become disabled in the future. People do not choose when to get sick or disabled, and so arbitrary cut-off dates make no sense.</p><p>These so-called concessions are nothing more than an attempt by Keir Starmer to quiet dissent within his own party. Over the weekend, Eluned Morgan [the Welsh first minister] hailed these partial U-turns as a personal victory, despite having “reserved her position” on the proposed welfare cuts barely three months ago.</p><p>Nearly 200 schools with spades in the ground, that are planning to open in just two months’ time, have reported they are set to exceed the government’s initial projections on places, meaning more high-quality, accessible and affordable childcare options for parents.</p><p>Thanks to the brilliant work from school and early years leaders, these new school-based nursery places and thousands more across the provider sector are set to be available in time for working parents to take up the 30 government-funded hours, saving them up to £7,500 on average every year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jun/30/welfare-bill-keir-starmer-liz-kendall-rebels-labour-latest-politics-live-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
