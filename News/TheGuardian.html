 The plan envisions an eventual role for the <strong>Palestinian Authority</strong> – something Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> has long opposed. But it requires the authority, which administers parts of the <strong>West Bank</strong>, to undergo a sweeping reform programme that could take years.<br><br>
