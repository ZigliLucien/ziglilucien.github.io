It’s that feeling of losing your best friend, and coming to terms with that. I was playing around with the riff and thought, ‘What I need is a really good pianist’, and then, ‘Hmmm, I wonder who I can call?’ And of course, who better than Elton John?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/17/sam-fender-elton-john-one-day-mercury-prize">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
