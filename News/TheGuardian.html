Happy Black History Month! We are now a week into a time of reflection on the richness of Black history and culture in the UK. Yet, too often one of the main aspects of that history – the debate around reparations for transatlantic enslavement – feels stuck in a loop. When the question of redress is raised, the backlash swiftly follows: too complicated, too divisive, too unfair.</p><p>We saw this happen last year, when Keir Starmer became the first sitting British prime minister to visit a Pacific island nation. He hoped to leave with upbeat headlines about new Commonwealth partnerships. Instead, the trip was dominated by demands for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/24/starmers-refusal-to-discuss-enslavement-reparations-has-only-magnified-the-issue">justice for historic wrongs</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Politics</strong></em> | Keir Starmer has criticised Robert Jenrick’s comments complaining about “not seeing another white face” in parts of Birmingham, saying the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/08/starmer-says-jenrick-is-hard-to-take-seriously-after-birmingham-comments">shadow justice secretary was “hard to take seriously”</a>.</p><p><em><strong>France</strong></em> | Édouard Philippe, a former French prime minister and one-time ally of Emmanuel Macron, has said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/07/edouard-philippe-sebastien-lecornu-france-emmanuel-macron-elections">he favours early presidential elections</a> given the gravity of the political crisis rocking the country.</p><p><em><strong>Music</strong></em> | Prosecutors <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/07/cps-to-appeal-against-dismissal-of-terrorism-charge-against-kneecaps-liam-og-o-hannaidh">will appeal against a court’s decision</a> to throw out a terrorism charge against the Kneecap rapper Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh. The 27-year-old was accused of displaying a flag in support of the proscribed terrorist organisation Hezbollah at a gig last November until a technical error in the way he was charged led to the chief magistrate ruling he could not try the case.</p><p><em><strong>Business </strong></em>| The EU has announced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/07/eu-plan-to-match-trump-steel-tariffs-spurs-existential-threat-to-uk-steel-industry">it will match</a> Donald Trump’s steel tariffs, doubling levies on imports to 50% in a move condemned as “an existential threat” to the industry in the UK.</p><p><em><strong>Gaza </strong></em>| A new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/israel-intercepts-another-gaza-aid-flotilla-amid-criticism-over-treatment-of-activists">Gaza-bound aid flotilla</a> has been intercepted by the Israeli army, days after the detention of activists on board vessels bound for the war-torn territory caused international outrage and widespread protests.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/wednesday-briefing-how-to-fight-the-right-on-reparations">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
