This continues to be the case, with only 51% of new personal independence payment (Pip) claims processed within 75 working days in 2024–25, against the department’s target of 75%.</p><p>In 2023, the department told the previous committee that it intended to process up to 20% of Pip claims using the new online service by 2026. We are concerned, however, that this timetable may not be achieved as the department now says only that it believes it can reach the 20% target by 2029 when the programme is due to be completed.</p><p>Our committee received reassurances three years ago that improvements would have manifested by now; we are now told that they are a further three years off. This is simply not good enough for our constituents, who we know risk being pushed into debt or poverty by a department unresponsive to their needs.</p><p>We always aim to make Pip award decisions as quickly as possible, and the Timms review is looking at Pip as a whole to make sure it is fit and fair for the future.</p><p>Records show that three companies, either owned by Cunningham or in which she served as a director, were struck off by Companies House for apparently failing to file required documents.</p><p>Failing to file company accounts is a criminal offence under UK law and while directors can be prosecuted this action is rarely taken.</p><p>Like many entrepreneurs, I’ve set up small companies over the years … I tried out different business ideas. Some became inactive. And that happens to thousands. They were all dormant, by the way. Every year. There was never any wrongdoing. No one was defrauded. And I passed all CPS vetting right after that.</p><p>Companies House routinely strikes off inactive or non-filing companies. It’s a paperwork sanction. The system is designed to clear dead companies out of the register. That’s hundreds of thousands of UK companies that are struck off every year. Overwhelmingly, because they’re dormant and admin has lapsed. It’s not wrongdoing. It’s just a way to get rid of dead companies. Lots of people do it.</p><p>And you know what? We should reward that because I was taking risk. All my money went into that. Sadly, it didn’t work out because of Covid. And that’s what happened.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/jan/09/labour-pubs-disability-benefits-assisted-dying-defence-spending-farage-reform-latest-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
