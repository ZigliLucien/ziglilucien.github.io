You told me the threshold was too low. You told me it would hit small family farms. We listened, and we are making changes.</p><p>In terms of inheritance tax changes, that is it. I also say with the greatest respect to those outside, it is those inside who have engaged with us constructively and relatively quietly that have had an influence in this process, not those blaring their horns.</p><p>If the Tories took the red wall in 2019 – and I was part of that, by the way, I represented a seat in the Midlands – we took the rural wall in 2024. We’ve got 49 rural seats and 87 semi rural on one of them. So 136 rural and semi rural seats. That’s a huge representation in parliament.</p><p>And I have conversations with those MPs week in, week out, and they are expressing concerns or ideas to ministers all the time, and I’m doing all that I can to ensure that rural communities know that we’re on their side. As a government, we truly care about rural Britain, because we are the, you know, we can have. We are the party with more representation than others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/jan/08/starmer-labour-reform-uk-tories-two-child-benefit-cap-nigel-farage-kemi-badenoch-uk-politics-live-latest-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
