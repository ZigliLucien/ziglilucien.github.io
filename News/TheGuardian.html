 Russell George, the Conservative member for Montgomeryshire, said he was withdrawing his candidacy to stand in next year’s election to focus on clearing his name.<br><br>
 The Senedd member was one of a number of people linked to the Conservative party reported to have made bets on the election date, which was called by then-prime minister Rishi Sunak.<br><br>
 Senedd Conservative leader Darren Millar withdrew the whip from George last week after the Gambling Commission announced the charges, meaning he now sits as an independent within the Welsh parliament.</p><p>George, 50, said in a statement on Tuesday: “I was shocked and surprised to have been informed by the Gambling Commission that I am facing charges for cheating.<br><br>
 “To be clear, I have never cheated. However, given the Gambling Commission’s decision, and my understanding of what will follow, this is likely to be a lengthy process that may not be resolved by May 2026.<br><br>
 “In the circumstances, I feel I have no alternative but to withdraw my candidacy for next year’s Senedd elections so that I can focus on fighting to clear my name.<br><br>
 “I will of course continue to serve the people of Montgomeryshire to the very best of my ability.<br><br>
 “I am grateful for the many messages of support that I have received in recent days, particularly from constituents.”<br><br>
 Among others facing charges are: Craig Williams, the former MP for Montgomeryshire; Nick Mason, a former chief data officer for the party; Laura Saunders, the Conservative candidate for Bristol North West last July; and Tony Lee, the Conservatives’ campaigns director, who is married to Saunders.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/22/welsh-tory-to-quit-at-next-senedd-poll-due-to-general-election-betting-charges">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
