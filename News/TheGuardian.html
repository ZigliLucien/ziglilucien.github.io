 Bella Ramsey, James Norton, Joe Alwyn, Himesh Patel, Harris Dickinson and the director Ken Loach are also signatories.<br><br>
 In mid-April, supreme court judges <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/16/critics-of-trans-rights-win-uk-supreme-court-case-over-definition-of-woman">unanimously ruled</a> the terms “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex. <br><br>
 This means a gender recognition certificate (GRC) does not change a person’s legal sex for the purposes of the Equality Act.<br><br>
 The ruling has been interpreted to mean that trans women can be excluded from women-only spaces like toilets and changing rooms.<br><br>
 The open letter said: “We believe the ruling undermines the lived reality and threatens the safety of trans, non-binary, and intersex people living in the UK.”</p><p>It added the film and television community had previously come together in response to the Me Too and Black Lives Matter movements by “reflecting” upon working practices and “uplifting” a broad spectrum of voices.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/more-than-400-actors-and-film-industry-professionals-sign-open-letter-supporting-trans-rights">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
