This was the most powerful storm to strike the island nation, packing winds of up to 185mph at its peak.</p><p>Western parts of Jamaica were worst hit, with 90% of homes in the town of Black River losing their roof or being destroyed entirely. Roughly three-quarters of the country lost electricity, with at least 19 people known to have lost their lives at the time of publication. The cleanup operation was hampered by thunderstorms even after Melissa cleared to the north. The hurricane continued northwards, but was a slightly weakened category 3 storm by the time it made landfall in Cuba. Nonetheless, the storm continued to bring winds of up to 120mph and torrential rains.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/31/weather-tracker-hurricane-melissa-caribbean-jamaica-haiti-cuba">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
