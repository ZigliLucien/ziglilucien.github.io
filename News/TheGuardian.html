While the HAL scheme requires major works to the M25, assessment indicates that the HWL scheme would also have a considerable impact on the M25.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/nov/25/nigel-farage-nathan-gill-labour-reform-uk-russia-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
