Unaware that she was pregnant, the 25-year-old went to seek medical care at a hospital in Argentina’s northern province of Tucumán when she suffered abdominal pain.<br><br>
 In accordance with Argentina’s stringent anti-abortion legislation, Belén (not her real name) was reported by the hospital to the authorities and sentenced to eight years in prison for homicide. She did not regain her freedom until almost three years later, in 2017, after a feminist lawyer who took up her case convinced the Tucumán supreme court to overturn her conviction.<br><br>
 “There are many Beléns in Argentina and this madness will continue until abortion is legalized,” said Ana Correa, pro-abortion rights campaigner and author of the book Somos Belén (We Are Belén).<br><br>
 That long-awaited moment may be about to arrive.<br><br>
 Argentina is expected to move within one step of becoming the first major Latin American nation to legalize abortion on Thursday, when the lower house of congress votes on a legal abortion bill sponsored by President Alberto Fernández. The president holds a majority in the lower house, and a government source said the senate could vote the move into law as soon as next week.</p><p>The push for reform in Argentina is part of a pro-choice “green wave” sweeping through Latin America, symbolized by the green handkerchief that has become the campaign’s instantly recognizable flag across the entire region.<br><br>
 “The women of Argentina now enjoy the encouragement of all Latin America, where the green handkerchief is being raised up high from north to south,” said Claudia Piñeiro, an Argentinian author who has spent years campaigning for legal abortion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/dec/09/argentina-legalize-abortion-bill-congress-vote">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

Nobody is more surprised than Donald Trump, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/25/trump-putin-russia-ukraine-attacks">he is starting to think</a> that Vladimir Putin is not a straight shooter. “I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him,” he wrote on Truth Social on Sunday. “He has gone absolutely CRAZY! I’ve always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that’s proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!”</p><p>As ever with Trump, a part of you admires the chutzpah: the idea that Trump has long been troubled by Putin’s imperial ambitions is, of course, an absolutely warped version of the real history.

<tr><td><div class="item"><blockquote><blockquote><p>Federal contracts worth an estimated $100m set to be pulled, according to media reports </p><p>Earlier this morning, <strong>Alan Garber</strong>, president of <strong>Harvard University</strong>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5409576/trump-harvard-lawsuit-funding-international-students">told NPR’s </a><em><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5409576/trump-harvard-lawsuit-funding-international-students">Morning Edition</a></em> that elite institutions need to double down on their “commitment to the good of the nation” and “be firm in our commitments to what we stand for”.</p><p>Garber said he finds the measures taken by the Trump administration to be “perplexing”; while he acknowledges there is work to be done on campus regarding viewpoint diversity, he said <strong>he struggles to see a link between funding freezes and fighting antisemitism</strong>.</p><p>I think that we have heard from some people that they do feel that [Harvard lacks viewpoint diversity]. <strong>What is perplexing is the measures that they have taken to address these that don’t even hit the same people that they believe are causing the problems</strong>. Why cut off research funding? Sure, it hurts Harvard, but it hurts the country because after all, the <strong>research funding is not a gift</strong>. The research funding is given to universities and other research institutions to carry out work – research work – that <strong>the federal government designates as high-priority work</strong>. <strong>It is work that they want done</strong>. They are paying to have that work conducted. <strong>Shutting off that work does not help the country</strong>, even as it punishes Harvard, and <strong>it is hard to see the link between that and, say, antisemitism</strong>.</p><p>I would say that the federal government has the authority through the budgeting process to reallocate funds. But the question to ask is <strong>what problem is [Trump] trying to solve by doing that?</strong> The money that goes to research universities in the form of grants and contracts, which is almost all of the federal support that we get, is used to pay for work that <strong>we perform at the behest of the government</strong>. So in reallocating to some other use, including trade schools, it means that work just won’t be performed. So the right question is, <strong>is this the most effective use of federal funding?</strong> Do you really want to cut back on research dollars? I’m less concerned about whether it goes to a trade school or if it goes to some other project, like working on highways. The real question is, <strong>how much value does the federal government get from its expenditures on research? There is a lot of actual research demonstrating the returns to the American people have been enormous.</strong></p><p>I would say that <strong>we need to be firm in our commitments to what we stand for</strong>. And what we stand for – I believe I speak for other universities – is <strong>education</strong>, <strong>pursuit of the truth</strong>, <strong>helping to educate people for better futures</strong>. And hopefully our own students, after they graduate from our institutions, go out and serve the world. In the end, we’re about <strong>producing and disseminating knowledge and serving our nation and our world</strong>. <strong>When we fail in that, then we can expect to be attacked</strong>. So number one, I think we all need to <strong>redouble our commitment to the good of the nation and the world</strong>. And I know my fellow leaders fully embrace that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/may/27/donald-trump-bribery-pardon-sheriff-tariffs-harvard-ukraine-us-politics-live-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
