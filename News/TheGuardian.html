 Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed were rejected because they were suspected of planning to “document the activities of security forces and spread anti-Israel hatred”, according to a statement from the Israeli immigration ministry cited by Sky News and Politics UK.<br><br>
 Yang, who represents Earley and Woodley in Berkshire, and Mohamed, the MP for Sheffield Central, flew into Ben Gurion airport from Luton with their aides, according to reports. They said they were part of an MPs’ delegation coming to visit humanitarian aid projects and communities in the West Bank with UK charity partners. The pair were on their way back to the UK on Sunday, according to the chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones.<br><br>
 The foreign secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/david-lammy">David Lammy</a>, said in a statement on Saturday: “It is unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning that two British MPs on a parliamentary delegation to Israel have been detained and refused entry by the Israeli authorities.<br><br>
 “I have made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British parliamentarians, and we have been in contact with both MPs tonight to offer our support.<br><br>
 “The UK government’s focus remains securing a return to the ceasefire and negotiations to stop the bloodshed, free the hostages and end the conflict in Gaza.”</p><p>In a joint statement posted on X, the two MPs said they were “astounded” at being denied entry, and that it was vital for parliamentarians to be able to witness the situation on the ground in Palestine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/05/uk-foreign-secretary-criticises-israel-for-denying-two-labour-mps-entry">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
