 Francis had no further episodes of bronchial spasms, the Vatican said in its late update on Saturday. He had no fever and no signs of new infection, was feeding himself and continued his respiratory physiotherapy, the Vatican said.<br><br>
 The 88-year-old pope had a good response in his blood gas levels even during the “long periods” he was off the ventilator mask and only using high-flow supplemental oxygen. But his prognosis remained guarded, meaning he was not out of danger.<br><br>
 “The Holy Father is always vigilant” and aware of what was going on around him, the statement said, adding that he received the Eucharist and spent time in prayer.<br><br>
 The comparatively positive update came after Francis suffered a setback on Friday in his two-week battle against pneumonia.<br><br>
 Francis had a coughing fit in which he also inhaled vomit. Doctors aspirated the vomit and placed Francis on noninvasive mechanical ventilation, a mask that pumps oxygen into his lungs. Doctors said episode resulted in a “sudden worsening of the respiratory picture”.<br><br>
 The pope remained conscious and alert at all times and cooperated with the manoeuvres to help him recover.<br><br>
 The fact that Francis on Saturday was able to use just high-flow oxygen for long periods, without any significant effect on the levels of oxygen in his blood, was a sign his respiratory function was improving.<br><br>
 The pope, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, has lung disease and was admitted to Gemelli after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into pneumonia in both lungs.</p><p>The Vatican said the episode was different from the prolonged respiratory crisis on 22 February that was said to have caused Francis discomfort. Doctors not involved in Francis’s care said it was particularly alarming given his existing lung disease and fragility.<br><br>
 Types of noninvasive ventilation include a BiPAP machine, which helps people breathe by pushing air into their lungs. Doctors will often try such a machine for a while to see if the patient’s blood gas levels improve so they can go back to using oxygen alone. Friday’s statement said Francis showed a “good response” to the gas exchange using the mechanical ventilation.<br><br>
 Doctors did not resume referring to Francis being in “critical condition”, which has been absent from their statements for four days now. But they said he was not out of danger, given the complexity of his case.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/01/pope-francis-remains-in-stable-condition-a-day-after-respiratory-crisis">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
