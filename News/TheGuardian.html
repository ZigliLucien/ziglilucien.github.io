And the cost to society of this is huge, the cost for councils of temporary accommodation, when people can no longer afford the rent, putting families in B&amp;Bs, kids having to move to school all the time because parents have moved from B&amp;B to another lot of temporary accommodation, and there’s costs for years to come, because all the evidence shows that kids that are growing up poor are less likely to get into work and more reliant on the welfare state in the future for them.</p><p>So this is a good investment in those kids, to give them the chances that I want for my kids, and everyone wants for their kids.
