 Military officials and defence minister <strong>Israel Katz</strong> said on Wednesday that the satellite, launched late on Tuesday, will enhance Israel’s ability to collect images like the 12,000 gathered over <strong>Iran</strong> during a 12-day war earlier this year.<br><br>
 “This is also a message to all our enemies, wherever they may be – we are keeping an eye on you at all times and in all situations,” Katz said in a post on X.<br><br>
 The AP reports that in addition to monitoring Iran, Israel gains reconnaissance capabilities in other parts of the Middle East as it conducts what prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> has called a “seven-front war,” with Israeli forces striking targets in <strong>Lebanon</strong>, <strong>Syria</strong>, <strong>Yemen</strong> and <strong>Iraq</strong> throughout the 23 months of war in <strong>Gaza</strong>.<br><br><strong>Maj Gen Amir Baram</strong> said the satellite, called <strong>Ofek 19</strong>, was part of a broader effort “to maintain persistent, simultaneous surveillance of any point throughout the Middle East”.<br><br>
 Israel’s decades-old space programme has expanded its fleet with several satellite launches in recent years and is one of the few nations globally with high resolution monitoring and intelligence gathering capabilities.<br><br>
 The aerospace and defence industry is a pillar of Israel’s economy and the satellite’s manufacturer, <strong>Israel Aerospace Industries</strong>, builds and sells satellites, missile systems, drones and aircraft to Israel as well as countries in <strong>Europe</strong>, <strong>Asia</strong> and <strong>North America</strong>.<br><br>
 Israel’s military did not say from where the satellite was launched on Tuesday evening, according to the AP.</p><p>The <strong>Israeli</strong> military said on Wednesday it intercepted a missile launched from <strong>Yemen</strong>, as sirens were activated in <strong>Tel Aviv</strong> and several other areas across the country, reports Reuters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/03/gaza-graveyard-international-humanitarian-law-unrwa-israel-middle-east-crisis-latest-updates-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
