Marles said in a statement:</p><p>We are committed to AUKUS and we look forward to working closely with the US on the review. The United States advised Australia and the UK of the review.<br><br>
 It is natural that the Administration would want to examine this major undertaking including progress and delivery, just as the UK Government recently concluded an AUKUS review and reaffirmed its support including through the appointment of Sir Stephen Lovegrove as its AUKUS Adviser.</p><p>Importantly, AUKUS will grow both US and Australian defence industry as well as generating thousands of new manufacturing jobs. There is bipartisan support in the United States with the passage of important provisions in the National Defence Authorization Act in 2023 to enable the transfer of US Virginia class submarines to Australia, and to enable Australians to work on maintenance activities of US Virginia class submarines.<br><br>
 Our engagement with the Trump Administration and across the full political spectrum in the United States has shown clear and consistent support for AUKUS.

Yet the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/jun/09/tony-awards-2025-maybe-happy-ending-and-nicole-scherzinger-win-big-while-george-clooney-misses-out">most recent ceremony</a> experienced a surprise surge in viewership, with broadcast viewership <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/ratings/tony-awards-2025-ratings-largest-audience-since-2019-1236423861/">up 44%</a> compared to the 2024 installment. It was the largest audience since the last pre-pandemic edition in 2019. That seems to sync up with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/may/29/broadway-box-office-season">the record-setting season</a> that the awards were celebrating, where Broadway productions featured a number of movie stars drawing huge crowds (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/mar/24/othello-broadway-ticket-prices">and ticket prices</a>).</p><p>Yet apart from George Clooney and a few other familiar faces, it wasn’t a particularly starry Tonys; Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal and Kieran Culkin weren’t nominated, and there wasn’t a single crossover mass-culture powerhouse like Hamilton or The Producers (whose winning telecasts are still the highest-rated of the 21<sup>st</sup> century). Moreover, Broadway isn’t alone; the Oscars experienced ratings growth (part of a four-year upward trend), and the left-for-dead Golden Globes have stabilized. This trend goes back nearly a year, to last fall, when MTV’s more specialized Video Music Awards saw an uptick and Emmy viewership jumped up 50% to a three-year high. Awards shows, so often derided as bloated, self-congratulatory ratings ploys, have somehow survived the streaming apocalypse to become broadcast TV’s last stand.
