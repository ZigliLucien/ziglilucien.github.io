I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you the latest news lines over the next few hours.</p><p><strong>President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill cleared a crucial hurdle on Thursday, as the House of Representatives voted roughly along party lines to begin a debate that would lead to a vote on passage later in the morning.</strong></p><p><strong>Donald Trump ambushed the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, by playing him a video that he falsely claimed proved genocide was being committed against white people under “the opposite of apartheid”.</strong> Ramaphosa – who earlier said that he had come to Washington to “reset” the relationship between the two countries – refused to take the bait and suggested that they “talk about it very calmly”.</p><p><strong>Ramaphosa expects Trump to visit South Africa during G2o meeting. </strong>His spokesperson, <strong>Vincent Magwenya,</strong> told South African TV station Newzroom Afrika that the Oval Office meeting was “an orchestrated show for the cameras” and that the “real business” of the trip was the bilateral closed-door meeting.</p><p><strong>Trump said he will make a decision in the near future about taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, a move which he said he is giving “very serious consideration”. </strong>In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he will speak with treasury secretary Scott Bessent; commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick; and federal housing finance director, William Pulte, about doing so.</p><p><strong>The Trump administration formally accepted the controversial gift of a Boeing 747 jetliner from the government of Qatar, and directed the air force to assess how quickly the plane can be upgraded for possible use as a new Air Force One.</strong> The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/trump-qatar-plane">offer of the jet</a> has set off a firestorm of bipartisan criticism of Trump, particularly following the president’s visit to the country last week to arrange US business deals.</p><p><strong>A federal judge ruled that the Department of Homeland Security’s attempt to deport migrants to South Sudan was “unquestionably violative” of an injunction he had issued earlier.</strong> US district judge Brian E Murphy made the remark at an emergency hearing he had ordered in Boston following the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/trump-deportations-south-sudan">Trump administration’s apparent deportation of eight people to South Sudan</a>, despite most of them being from other countries. On Tuesday, Murphy ruled that the administration could not let a group of migrants being deported to South Sudan leave the custody of US immigration authorities.</p><p><strong>The justice department moved to cancel a settlement with Minneapolis that called for an overhaul of its police department following the murder of George Floyd, as well as a similar agreement with Louisville, Kentucky, after the death of Breonna Taylor,</strong> saying it does not want to pursue the cases. The move shows how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/justice-department-settlement-minneapolis-louisville">the civil rights division of the justice department is changing rapidly</a> under Donald Trump, dismantling Biden-era work and investigating diversity programs. It also comes amid pressure on the right to recast Floyd’s murder, undermine diversity efforts and define liberal-run cities like Minneapolis as crime-ridden.</p><p><strong>The US army said it has no plans to recognize Trump’s birthday on 14 June when he presides over part of the army’s celebrations of its 250th anniversary. </strong>Trump, who is turning 79 on the same day, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/may/21/donald-trump-jr-golden-dome-immigration-us-politics-live?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-682e160a8f087e0ddcd2b82d#block-682e160a8f087e0ddcd2b82d">will play a big role in the celebrations</a>, which will cost between $25m and $45m, will see the army hold a parade down Washington’s Constitution Avenue, one of the main thoroughfares that cuts through the capital. The parade was not part of the original planning for the 14 June celebrations and was added this year, stoking criticism from Democratic lawmakers and others that Trump has hijacked the event.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/may/22/donald-trump-tax-and-spending-big-beautiful-bill-house-vote-us-politics-live-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
