They did more than simply work and earn a salary.</p><p><strong>Mahmood said that the European convention on human rights and refugee conventions were being “used in a way that was never intended” and said she would propose reforms before Christmas. </strong>The Home Office is working on new guidance to the courts on how they should interprete two of the articles in the convention.</p><p><strong>Mahmood said the policy of putting migrants in hotels had been a “total disaster for the country”.</strong></p><p><strong>She said her “jaw hit the floor” when she learned last week about the Home Office spending £600 on a taxi journey for a migrant with a GP appointment a long way from the hotel where they were staying. </strong>She ordered a review after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/24/labour-tories-conservatives-reform-uk-politics-live-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d3ddb48f08af03abbe6ed3#block-68d3ddb48f08af03abbe6ed3">a BBC investigation highlighted this.</a></p><p><strong>She suggested that some of those who have been putting up St George’s flags or union jack flags around the country have the wrong motives. </strong>Asked about flags, she said:</p><p>I love the St George’s flag and I love the Union Jack. They are flags that I see myself reflected in.And where our flags are being used as a symbol of unity I’m all for it. I would like to see more of our flags actually on our civic institutions …</p><p>I think the thing that we have to be careful about is the motives of some - not all - but some of the people that are putting up the flags. They are speaking to nationalism. And I’m a patriot, not a nationalist.</p><p><strong>Mahmood said that Margaret Thatcher was one of her political heroes.</strong> In a quickfire question round, asked to name her heroes, Mahmood said:</p><p>I have two women who I look up to for their strength and their steel, and that’s Benazir Bhutto and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/margaret-thatcher/">Margaret Thatcher</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/28/labour-conference-keir-starmer-latest-uk-politics-news-live-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
