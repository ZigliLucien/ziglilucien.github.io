With Donald Trump’s tariff war and musings about Canada’s future as a 51st state the inescapable mood music, many voters who had given up on the Liberals appear ready to give them another hearing – and Poilievre is trying to distance himself from the president whose methods he was once so happy to adopt.</p><p><em><strong>Trump administration</strong></em> | A catastrophic security leak triggered outrage in US politics after senior Trump administration officials accidentally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/journalist-trump-yemen-war-chat-reaction">broadcast highly sensitive military plans through a Signal group chat</a> with a journalist reading along.
