When David Cameron was Tory leader, he got it up to 0.7%, the UN target, Balls said. Balls said this would be the lowest level for UK aid spending since records began in the 1960s, and the lowest level for any European country other than Cyprus. Russia would be the only developed country spending less, Balls claimed. He asked Stride what this said about the Tory party.</p><p>What it speaks to is the position that we are in as an economy. We are living on borrowed time. And unless we have a government that recognises that, and takes these tough decisions … then we will end up in a very, very difficult position.</p><p>There is a point on that journey at which the wheels of this economy will completely come off.

But they are the right ones.</p><p>The Tories let welfare bills, civil service numbers and asylum hotel use skyrocket on their watch - and they’ve never apologised.
