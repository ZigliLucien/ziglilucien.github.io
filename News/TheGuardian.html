They will not be connected to the state’s gas network and will run on electric systems. New agricultural and manufacturing buildings, some of which use gas for high-temperature industrial processes, are excluded.</p><p>Though still marketed as “natural”, and sometimes even as “clean”, gas is actually methane – a highly potent greenhouse gas. It releases carbon dioxide when burned. The electricity grid is moving from being dominated by coal-fired power to renewable energy. Electric appliances are better for the planet and the people who live on it. It is a necessary part of getting to net zero emissions.</p><p>Gas is expensive. Analysis has found electrification of appliances should save households nearly $1,000 a year on their energy bills.

For decades, it has relied on reservoirs in Bass Strait, but they are running low, and all potential new sources are expensive.
