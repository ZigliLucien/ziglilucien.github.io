The Dallas police chief, Daniel Comeaux, said that the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The shooter died from a “self-inflicted gun wound”, according to the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem.</p><p><strong>The </strong><strong>DHS said no members of law enforcement were hurt in the attack.</strong> But Comeaux also said that officials would not be releasing the identities of any victims at this time.</p><p><strong>DHS officials say this</strong> <strong>was “an attack on </strong><strong>Ice law enforcement”. </strong>At both today’s press conference and in a statement, law enforcement said that shell casings found near the shooter had “anti-Ice” messaging on them.</p><p><strong>The shooter has been identified as 29-year-old </strong><strong>Joshua Jahn</strong><strong>, </strong>according to NBC News – which cited several senior law enforcement officials.</p><p><strong>Dallas police said that shots were fired “from an adjacent building”</strong>. The DHS later added that the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”. All three victims were inside the van at the time the gunman opened fire.</p><p>The Dallas field office where the shooting occurred is used for short-term processing of people in custody. The victims may have been recently arrested by Ice. The facility is along Interstate 35 East, south-west of a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and just blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.</p><p><strong>Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, the Texas governor, </strong><strong>Greg Abbott</strong><strong>, called the attack an “assassination”.</strong> For her part, Noem said that “these horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about Ice has consequences”.</p><p><strong>Donald Trump instantly politicized the shooting,</strong> claiming in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115261106680507707">a social media post</a> that it “is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis.’”</p><p><strong>The </strong><strong>vice-president, JD Vance, claimed without evidence that the shooting was carried out by “a violent left</strong><strong>wing extremist” who was “politically motivated to go after law enforcement”.</strong> While the FBI has said that authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, officials have neither confirmed a motive nor corroborated Vance’s claims about the shooter’s ideological background.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/24/dallas-texas-ice-facility-shooting">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
