Rachel Reeves, April 2022</p><p>It is important to address the chancellor’s statement in her letter to you of 29th October that she and her husband were not aware of the need for a licence. This was a key consideration reflected in my advice to you yesterday. However, emails identified since then, and made public today, demonstrate that the chancellor’s husband was in fact made aware of the need for a licence during the summer of 2024 and that he instructed the estate agency to obtain the licence accordingly. It is clear from his explanation today, that the chancellor’s husband did not recall this exchange, which took place at a very busy time. Furthermore, his contact with the estate agency, during attempts to clarify matters during the course of yesterday, did not give rise to any indication that this prior exchange had taken place. I understand this account and it is helpful to have the clarity (from the content of these emails) demonstrating their desire to comply with the selective licensing regime. It is regrettable that information provided on successive days has generated confusion, but I find no evidence of bad faith.</p><p>The right decision and an important moment for the victims of Epstein.</p><p>I hope all those who were elected to Parliament and chose to defend inaction rather than speak out now regret the choice they made.</p><p>It was emotional listening live to those who knew Virginia Giuffre tonight.</p><p>Their collective courage has changed history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/31/uk-politics-prince-andrew-latest-news-updates-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
