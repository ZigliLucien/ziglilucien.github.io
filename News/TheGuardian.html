 Vance gave the first American pope a letter from <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and the first lady inviting him. The Chicago-born pope took the letter and put it on his desk and <strong>was heard saying “at some point”</strong>, in the video footage of the meeting provided by Vatican Media.<br><br>
 Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, also gave the Augustinian pope a copy of two of St Augustine’s most seminal works, The City of God and On Christian Doctrine, the vice-president’s office said. Another gift: A Chicago Bears T-shirt with Leo’s name on it.<br><br>
 “As you can probably imagine, people in the United States are extremely excited about you,” Vance told Leo as they exchanged gifts.<br><br>
 Leo gave Vance a bronze sculpture with the words in Italian “Peace is a fragile flower”, and a coffee-table sized picture book of the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace. Leo noted that Francis had chosen not to live in them and added: “And I may live in, but it’s not totally decided.”<br><br>
 Vance led the US delegation to Sunday’s formal mass opening the pontificate of the first American pope. Joining him at the meeting on Monday was secretary of state <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, also a Catholic, Vance spokesperson <strong>Luke Schroeder</strong> said. The two then also met with the Vatican foreign minister, <strong>Archbishop Paul Gallagher</strong>.<br><br>
 “There was an exchange of views on some current international issues, calling for respect for humanitarian law and international law in areas of conflict and for a negotiated solution between the parties involved,” according to a Vatican statement after their meeting.<br><br>
 After greeting Leo briefly at the end of Sunday’s mass, Vance spent the rest of the day in separate meetings, including with Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong>. He also met with European Commission president <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong> and Italy’s premier <strong>Giorgia Meloni</strong>, who said she hoped the trilateral meeting could be a “new beginning”.<br><br>
 In the evening, Meloni spoke by phone with Trump and several other European leaders ahead of Trump’s expected call with Vladimir Putin today, according to a statement from Meloni’s office.</p><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s bid to gut the top US consumer watchdog has left the agency unable to protect consumers amid mounting fears of recession, according to workers.</p><p>And we are on the verge of another major financial crisis, so it’s terrifying. The one thing we were created to do we can’t do – at a time when we’re most needed.</p><p>We have helped millions of people. We have returned billions of dollars. It isn’t the way it has to be that there is nowhere to turn to when a bank or credit card rips you off. That is something everyone is exposed to. That’s what’s heartbreaking to me about the possibility of my job disappearing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/may/19/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-russia-us-politics-news-live">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
