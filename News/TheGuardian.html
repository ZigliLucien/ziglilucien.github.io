We are resuming our live coverage of the Department of Justice’s long-awaited release of documents from the federal investigations into <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>, the late sex offender who socialized with <strong>Donald Trump</strong> for more than 15 years.</p><p>The first cache of ‘Epstein Files’ were released on Friday evening after months of delay and stalling from the Trump administration. Deputy attorney general <strong>Todd Blanche</strong> told Fox News that he expected the department to release several hundred thousand more files in the coming weeks.</p><p>Missing documents &amp; ‘over-redactions’:</p><p><strong>Khanna</strong> said that the partial “document dump this afternoon does not comply” with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, and told CNN, adding: “The most important documents are missing.” Those documents are a draft 60-count federal indictment outlining charges against Epstein, and a detailed memorandum summarizing the evidence that was disregarded by the US attorney, <strong>Alex Acosta</strong>, who chose instead to offer Epstein an extraordinarily lenient plea deal.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/epstein-files-explode-open-doj-details-discovery-powerful-figures-more-than-1200-victims">a Fox News report</a>, the justice department redacted the names and identifiers of victims and “the same redaction standards were applied to politically exposed individuals and government officials”. <strong>Massie</strong> <a href="https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2002176606664573208">wrote</a> on social media that the attorney general, Pam Bondi, could be convicted by a future justice department of obstruction of justice if she violated a provision of the law by redacting the names of government officials. Massie noted that the law explicitly states that no documents may be “withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official”. <strong>Blanche</strong> later called Fox News to insist that the justice department is “not redacting the names of any politicians”.</p><p>Instead, the justice department said it may have “over-redacted” the Epstein files in order to “protect victims”. <strong>Jay Clayton</strong>, US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in court on Friday that it had blacked out the faces of almost every woman photographed with Jeffrey Epstein, citing issues determining who was a victim of the paedophile. Mr Clayton reportedly noted the approach could be “over-redaction”, but blamed it on the 30-day timeframe Congress set for releasing the documents.</p><p>Who is in the Epstein files?</p><p>The files that were viewable included images of Epstein socialising with an array of prominent figures, including entertainers like <strong>Michael Jackson, Chris Tucker </strong>and<strong> Diana Ross,</strong> and the entrepreneur <strong>Richard Branson</strong>. The images also show former British royal <strong>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor </strong>and his ex-wife <strong>Sarah Ferguson</strong>.</p><p><strong>Peter Mandelson</strong>, who was sacked from his job as the UK’s ambassador to the US earlier this year, could be seen in a picture with Epstein who is being presented with a giant birthday cake.</p><p>There were many images of <strong>Bill Clinton</strong>, but very little about president Trump in the portion of the files released on Friday. But one seemingly innocuous snapshot of Epstein’s bookcase did include a reminder that he and Trump were once close. The image showed Epstein’s copy of Trump’s 1997 book, Trump: <em>The Art of the Comeback</em>, which the New York Times<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/us/politics/trump-epstein-birthday-book.html"> reported in July</a> included an inscription from Trump reading: “To Jeff – You are the greatest!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/dec/20/jeffrey-epstein-files-released-donald-trump-latest-news-photos-updates-live">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
