 Residents of the Granite city in north-east Scotland glimpsed the sun late on Thursday afternoon, with sunshine having been last recorded on 21 January.<br><br>
 The Met Office said that 30 minutes of sun was officially recorded in the Dyce area in the hour up to 4pm.<br><br>
 It followed weeks of unrelenting rain in the region and throughout the UK.<br><br>
 More than 277mm of rain fell on Aboyne in Aberdeenshire in January, about four times the monthly average, while the first 10 days of the year brought heavy snow to the north-east of Scotland.</p><p>In just the first three days of this month, south-east England received nearly a third of its average February rainfall.<br><br>
 The wintry weather is expected to continue, with a yellow warning for snow and ice for most of Scotland and northern England in place until 12 noon on Friday.<br><br>
 The Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said an air mass called Arctic maritime air is bringing temperatures down.<br><br>
 He said: “The snow and ice warnings that we’ve issued at the moment cover pretty much Scotland and northern parts of England. There may be some snow showers a little bit further south than that.<br><br>
 “We’re not expecting any particularly impactful snow and the conditions will be quite brief before we get another system coming in from the Atlantic over the weekend, but for the next few days it will feel quite a bit different, as we’ve got colder air coming in.”<br><br>
 BBC Scotland weather presenter Judith Ralston said: “With a change in weather type, we finally lose the stuck pattern of cloud, rain, and bitingly cold winds.<br><br>
 “This finally breaks, allowing a northerly air mass to set in, bringing much drier, brighter conditions, sunshine on the way on Friday and Saturday and a few wintry showers on Friday.”<br><br></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/feb/12/aberdeen-sees-sunshine-first-time-in-21-days">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

 Robin Windsor, 44, was found in a hotel room in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, in February 2024.<br><br>
 Jurors found Windsor was “vulnerable to rejection both emotionally and professionally” and that this was among the “contributing factors” that led to his death.<br><br>
 In a statement on Windsor’s X account on Thursday, after the conclusion of the inquest, his family said: “The coroner has now concluded the investigation into the cause of Robin’s death. It is with profound sadness that we acknowledge that Robin took his own life.<br><br>
 “As a family, together with Robin’s close friends, we can now begin to move forward and attempt, over time, to rebuild our lives.”<br><br>
 The Latin and ballroom dancer joined the BBC programme in 2010 and danced with actors Patsy Kensit, Anita Dobson and Lisa Riley, along with Dragons’ Den entrepreneur Deborah Meaden in four series until 2013.<br><br>
 He could not perform in the 2014 series because of a back injury and was dropped in 2015 but still appeared in the Christmas special that year, dancing alongside TV presenter Alison Hammond.<br><br>
 A written statement from Emmerdale actor Riley read to the inquest at West London coroner’s court said Windsor’s “glow had gone” after he was cut from the professional dancers’ lineup.<br><br>
 She said: “It was from this moment, on to the time of his death, he kept slipping deeper and deeper into endless depression.<br><br>
 “His glow had gone.”<br><br>
 Addressing Windsor’s family in the courtroom, the coroner Dr Anton van Dellen said: “I hope you can think of the happy times he brought to the public and the deep affection the public held him in.”<br><br>
 The dancer’s family thanked those who “marked (Windsor’s) life with such love”.<br><br>
 “We wish to express our sincere gratitude to everyone who has shown us kindness, compassion and support throughout the long and difficult period since Robin’s passing,” their statement said.<br><br>
 “Thank you to everyone who has remembered Robin and marked his life with such love.”<br><br>
 A BBC spokesperson said: “Our sympathies are with Robin’s family, friends and all who knew him. The whole of the Strictly Come Dancing family remain deeply saddened by his passing. Robin was a much-loved member of the team – both on and off air – during his time on the show.<br><br>
 “As the inquest has heard this week and the jury concluded, several complex factors contributed to how Robin felt at the time of his tragic death and our thoughts remain with all who knew and loved Robin.”<br><br>
 Windsor, from Ipswich, had been an ambassador for mental health charity Sane.<br><br>
 The Windsor family statement concluded: “If you or someone you care for is struggling with mental health, reaching out for support can really make a difference. You don’t have to face things alone.<br><br>
 “Support is available via organisations like Sane and You Are Loved (a company that provides mental health support for LGBT+ people).”</p><p><em>• In the UK and Ireland, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.ie">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.
