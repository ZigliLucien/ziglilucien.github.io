Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves spent yesterday denying that Labour broke a manifesto promise with its tax-raising budget. Given that Reeves had been expected to freeze income tax thresholds for weeks, it was a rather stale argument that did not go anywhere new. Then, late yesterday afternoon, the government opened up another broken manifesto argument with a surprise announcement about a U-turn on the employment rights bill.</p><p>Here is our overnight story by <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong> and<strong> Richard Partington.</strong></p><p><strong>Peter Kyle, the business secretary, has claimed<a href="https://news.sky.com/video/business-secretary-insists-no-manifesto-breach-over-u-turn-on-day-one-protection-from-unfair-dismissal-13476246"> that the U-turn does not breach Labour’s manifesto</a>. </strong>If you read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/nov/27/rachel-reeves-budget-2025-mansion-tax-labour-keir-starmer-conservatives-uk-politics-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-69288d188f081089431d3206#block-69288d188f081089431d3206">what the manifesto said</a>, it is hard to argue that this decision does not contradict it. But, in a clip for broadcasters last night, Kyle gave it a go. He argued:</p><p>We also promised in the manifesto that we would bring people together, that this would not be legislation, that this would not be legislations that pits one side against another …</p><p>The manifesto committed to day one rights. We are committing to day one rights. The manifesto committed us to finding compromise … and we are delivering on that.</p><p><strong>Sharon Graham, leader of Unite, one of the two biggest unions in Britain and a major donor to Labour, has denounced the U-turn. She said:</strong></p><p><em>The employment rights bill is a shell of its former self.<br>
   With fire and rehire and zero hours contracts not being banned, the Bill is already unrecognisable.<br>
  These constant row backs will only damage workers’ confidence that the protections promised will be worth the wait. Labour needs to keep its promises.</em></p><p><strong>Some Labour MPs have condemned the U-turn, with one calling it a “sellout”.</strong> This is<a href="https://x.com/AndyMcDonaldMP/status/1994315537501868413"> from </a><strong>Andy McDonald</strong>, a former shadow cabinet minister.</p><p>We can all read the manifesto ourselves and, and it says that we’ll deliver day one rights and that includes unfair dismissal.</p><p>We’re no longer doing it, so we’re doing something completely inconsistent what was in the manifesto.</p><p>It might be a compromise</p><p>It might even be necessary to get the Bill passed asap</p><p>Is this a sellout? Yes it certainly is. If it’s unfair to sack someone, it’s unfair whenever it occurs whether it’s day one or after 6 months. The principle is fairness.</p><p><strong>Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has rejected claims this is a U-turn. </strong>She has been doing the interview round this morning, and, in an interview with BBC Breakfast, when it was put to her that this was a U-turn, she replied:</p><p>I don’t accept that characterisation, I’m afraid. The employment rights bill represents the biggest upgrade to workers’ rights in a generation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/nov/28/workers-rights-bill-unfair-dismissal-uk-politics-latest-news-updates-labour-budget-keir-starmer">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
