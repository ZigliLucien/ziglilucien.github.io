 The program, lauded as one of the biggest presidential actions to help immigrant families in years, allowed undocumented spouses and stepchildren of US citizens to apply for a green card without first having to leave the country.<br><br>
 The temporary relief from deportation brought a brief sense of security to some 500,000 immigrants estimated to benefit from the program before Texas-based U.S. District Judge J. Campbell Barker put it on hold in August, days after applicants filed their paperwork.<br><br>
 Barker ruled yesterday that the Biden administration had overstepped its authority by implementing the program and had stretched the legal interpretation of relevant immigration law “<strong>past its breaking point</strong>.”<br><br>
 The short-lived Biden administration initiative known as <strong>“Keeping Families Together”</strong> would have been unlikely to remain in place after Donald Trump took office in January. But its early termination creates greater uncertainty for immigrant families as many are bracing for Trump’s return to the White House.<br></p><p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/11/politics/house-votes-count-election-dg/">CNN’s latest projection</a> of the crucial races to gain control of the House has Republicans ahead in ten of the contests, with, according to their projections, only six victories needed to tip them over the magic 218 for control.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/08/us-election-live-donald-trump-cabinet-house-of-representatives">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
