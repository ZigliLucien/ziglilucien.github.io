I think it is fair to say that as we’ve walked down that path over the course of the last few months, and we’ve been doing it with a view to signing this agreement in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of PNG’s independence, it is fair to say a lot more ambition has been brought to this agreement and we are really excited about the agreement that we will be signing in the next few days.</p><p>It certainly will transform the defence relationship between Australia and PNG, but beyond that, if you look at the various defence agreements we have with countries around the world, actually, it is hugely significant in that context.</p><p>The prime minister will be signing this in the next few days, so I will let the prime minister make those announcements and you will see them shortly enough.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/sep/14/australia-news-live-albanese-papua-new-guinea-aldi-solar-environment-richard-marles-sunday-ntwnfb">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
