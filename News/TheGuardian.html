At some points they’ve said it’s about equal pay. Other points, they’ve said it’s about a better service. Quite how you get a better service by cutting people’s pay, I don’t know.</p><p>I think different political decisions need to be made. Why should working people be forced to pay the price for austerity? Why should our members pay the price for cuts to local authorities?</p><p>Well, the Council have talked about equal pay liabilities. However, we have seen no details about that liability. And the challenge is, when talking about equal pay, we are not talking about harmonizing upwards and improving the pay of women. Nobody wins as a result of this type of equal pay, which is harmonizing downwards. Different political choices that need to be made about how local authorities are funded.</p><p>Well, I think that’s purile, to be perfectly frank with you. What we are engaged in is defending our members, pay and conditions, and we will make no apology for doing that time and time again. I’m not going to get into sort of mud slinging about personalities, but that type of briefing is purile. What we need to concentrate on is resolving this dispute.</p><p>Fundamentally what needs to happen now is the strike needs to be called off. Unite need to accept the offer that’s on the table. It’s a good offer and that is what we are asking them to do, and that is the way we’re going to get back to normal in Birmingham.</p><p>Now I know that other councils are sort of coming in to support, that there is logistical support from the Army and that some private sector support is already there, but of course, it’s completely unacceptable, the images are awful and people have enough to worry about in their lives without having to worry about rubbish collection alongside it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/apr/15/uk-politics-latest-news-us-uk-trade-steel-keir-starmer-sudan-nigel-farage">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
