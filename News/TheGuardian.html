 Streeting is understood to be concerned about a sharp rise in the number of people making sickness benefits claims because of diagnoses for mental illness, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the Times reported.<br><br>
 He has asked leading experts to investigate whether normal feelings have become “over-pathologised”, the newspaper said, as he seeks to grapple with the 4.4 million working-age people now claiming sickness or incapacity benefit.<br><br>
 The figure has risen by 1.2 million since 2019, while the number of 16 to 34-year-olds off work with long-term sickness because of a mental health condition is said to have grown rapidly in the same period.<br><br>
 Streeting told the Times he knew from “personal experience how devastating it can be for people who face poor mental health, have ADHD or autism and can’t get a diagnosis or the right support”.<br><br>
 He added: “I also know, from speaking to clinicians, how the diagnosis of these conditions is sharply rising.<br><br>
 “We must look at this through a strictly clinical lens to get an evidence-based understanding of what we know, what we don’t know, and what these patterns tell us about our mental health system, autism and ADHD services.<br><br>
 “That’s the only way we can ensure everyone gets timely access to accurate diagnosis and effective support.”</p><p><br>
 The review, which is expected to be launched on Thursday, is set to be led by Prof Peter Fonagy, a clinical psychologist at University College London specialising in child mental health, with Sir Simon Wessely, a former president of the Royal College of Psychiatry, acting as vice-chair.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/03/wes-streeting-orders-review-of-mental-health-diagnoses-as-benefit-claims-soar">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
