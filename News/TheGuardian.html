He said:</p><p>Over the next few months, the SNP will set out some radical policies that we know will transform Scotland – ambitious ideas that can be realised with the powers of independence.</p><p>For us to achieve that independence, the first step is to secure a legal referendum recognised by all. In 2011 we secured that reliable and dependable route when the SNP achieved a majority of seats at Holyrood.</p><p>Tariffs are very important for the Scottish economy and obviously scotch whisky is a unique product.</p><p>It can only be produced in Scotland. It’s not a product that can be produced in any other part of the world. So there’s a uniqueness about that, which I think means there is a case for it to be taken out of the tariffs arrangement that is now in place.</p><p>I think what’s important is that we focus on the solutions that are required now, and the absolutely immediate situation is a necessity for a ceasefire and for humanitarian aid to need to flow into Gaza so that the people of Gaza can be saved from the starvation that they face.</p><p>And I think President Trump is ideally positioned. In fact, he’s perhaps uniquely positioned to apply that pressure to Israel to ensure that there is safe passage for humanitarian aid to support the people of Gaza, who face an absolutely unbearable set of circumstances as a consequence of the conflict.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/28/starmer-trump-meeting-gaza-trade-palestine-latest-live-uk-politics-updates-news">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
