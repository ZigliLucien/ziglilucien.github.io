 It said that more recently, Israel appears to have dropped a longstanding policy against demolishing homes during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began last weekend. It said a residential building and three apartments have been destroyed over the past week, according to the AP. <br><br>
 Rights groups say discriminatory policies make it nearly impossible for <strong>Palestinians</strong> to expand or redevelop their neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem, forcing many to build without permits.
