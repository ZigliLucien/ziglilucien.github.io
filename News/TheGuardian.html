 The runaway ruminant mammal was trotting around Upper Seagry, near Chippenham, and was seen chasing a woman around the village and trying to eat oranges from a Christmas wreath, an eyewitness told the BBC.<br><br>
 Wiltshire police used riot shields and a lasso to catch the animal before it was safely returned to its owner.<br><br>
 The goat also attempted to munch on safety equipment from the back of the officer’s car.<br><br>
 “Apparently it’s not very nice,” one of the officers can be heard saying on bodyworn camera footage.<br><br>
 The officer added: “We’ve got it on a tow line, we’ve got some [riot] shields because he’s trying to butt my head.”<br><br>
 The animal briefly slipped the lasso before being re-captured and taken home on Thursday morning.<br><br>
 A Wiltshire police spokesperson said: “PC Ferris and PC Miller, from Chippenham Response, swiftly responded, controlled the situation and returned the goat to his owner.”<br><br>
 In October, an attempt to retrieve a stranded goat at the bottom of a bridge arch led to an emergency call-out in Cumbria to rescue someone attempting to save the animal.<br><br>
 Three fire crews and police were sent to Longtown Bridge in Carlisle after reports someone had gone into the water while trying to reach the animal.<br><br>
 They had managed to extricate themselves but to “prevent a repeat incident”, fire officers were sent to retrieve the animal, Longtown fire station said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/dec/20/police-use-riot-shields-to-help-recapture-runaway-wiltshire-goat">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
