They are playing out now. As you would expect, they are very repetitive – a lot of the questions and the answers are the same – but there are still plenty of new lines in them.</p><p>One of his most audacious answers came when he was speaking to Christopher Hope, political editor of GB News, Reform UK’s favourite TV channel. Hope asked if the government would stop the small boats, and Starmer said that the returns agreement that he negotiated with France would make a difference. But then he went on to claim that they were “Farage boats, in many senses” because after Brexit the Dublin convention returns agreement that used to be in place no longer applied.</p><p>The returns agreement with France is important because we need to establish that if you come by boat, you will be returned to France.</p><p>I accept the numbers [returned so far under the agreement] are low. We had to prove the concept and prove that it could work. We’ve now done that. But now we need to ramp that up.</p><p>Surprised by PM repeating Ed Davey’s bogus analysis: boats are nothing to do with Brexit; &amp; the Dublin convention never worked</p><p><em>There’s also increasing evidence of a Brexit effect [in explaining why migrants want to leave France and come to the UK]. We speak with asylum seekers now, and often they’ve claimed asylum in the EU country, sometimes been refused, but they understand that because the UK is no longer a part of the EU, and no longer party to the EU’s fingerprint database for asylum seekers, if they can get to the UK, they have another bite of the cherry and another chance to secure asylum status and remain in Europe.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/01/keir-starmer-labour-conference-nigel-farage-reform-uk-politics-latest-news-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
