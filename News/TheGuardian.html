Marles said in a statement:</p><p>We are committed to AUKUS and we look forward to working closely with the US on the review. The United States advised Australia and the UK of the review.<br><br>
 It is natural that the Administration would want to examine this major undertaking including progress and delivery, just as the UK Government recently concluded an AUKUS review and reaffirmed its support including through the appointment of Sir Stephen Lovegrove as its AUKUS Adviser.</p><p>Importantly, AUKUS will grow both US and Australian defence industry as well as generating thousands of new manufacturing jobs. There is bipartisan support in the United States with the passage of important provisions in the National Defence Authorization Act in 2023 to enable the transfer of US Virginia class submarines to Australia, and to enable Australians to work on maintenance activities of US Virginia class submarines.<br><br>
 Our engagement with the Trump Administration and across the full political spectrum in the United States has shown clear and consistent support for AUKUS.
