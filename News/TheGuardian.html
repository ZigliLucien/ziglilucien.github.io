He said in the conference call with reporters:</p><p><em>It’s a very important achievement. Of course, at the same time this is a very important moment which is connected to an emotional overload of everyone involved and emotional reactions.</em></p><p><em>We carefully monitor all the reactions. However, President Putin takes those decisions which are necessary for the security of our country.</em></p><p><em>Only a sense of total impunity can allow Russia to carry out such strikes and continue increasing their scale. There is no real military logic to this, but there is significant political meaning. </em></p><p><em>In doing this, Putin shows just how much he despises the world - the world that spends more effort on “dialogue” with him than on real pressure. Like any criminal, Russia can only be constrained by force. </em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/may/26/ukraine-russia-drone-strikes-trump-putin-latest-updates">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
