The Hungarian Film Artists Association said in a statement that Tarr died on Tuesday “after a long and serious illness” and that “the grieving family asks for the understanding of the press and the public, and that they not be contacted for a statement during these difficult days”.</p><p>Tarr became renowned internationally in the 90s and 00s as his films were shown more widely – partly because of their inordinate length (including the seven-and-a-half-hour Sátántangó), and partly because of what appeared to be his definitive expression of middle-European black and white miserablism.

You can laugh a lot.” He added that they were not pessimistic. “I only ask this – how did you feel when you came out of the movie theatre after watching my film? Did you feel stronger or weaker? That’s the main question. I want you to be stronger.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2026/jan/06/bela-tarr-hungarian-director-of-satantango-and-werckmeister-harmonies-dies-aged-70">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
