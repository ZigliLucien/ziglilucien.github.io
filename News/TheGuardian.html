 The 27-year-old, of Belfast, was charged after an investigation by the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command and is scheduled to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 18 June.<br><br>
 O’Hanna, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara, was charged with displaying a flag at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, north London on 21 November last year “in such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable suspicion that he is a supporter of a proscribed organisation”, the Met said.<br><br>
 The force added: “Officers from the Met’s counter-terrorism command were made aware on Tuesday 22 April of an online video from the event. An investigation was carried out, which led to the Crown Prosecution Service authorising the above charge.”<br><br>
 The counter terrorism internet referral unit (CTIRU) is a national unit based within the Met’s counter-terrorism command, which is dedicated to identifying terrorist and extremist material online.<br><br>
 Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.<br><br>
 Last month it emerged that footage of the Northern Irish rap trio allegedly calling for the death of British MPs is being assessed by counter-terrorism police.<br><br>
 A Metropolitan police spokesperson said at the time: “We were made aware of a video on April 22, believed to be from an event in November 2024, and it has been referred to the counter-terrorism internet referral unit for assessment and to determine whether any further police investigation may be required.<br><br>
 “We have also been made aware of another video believed to be from an event in November 2023.”<br><br>
 Kneecap said they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and would not incite violence against any individual, adding the video in question has been taken out of context.<br><br>
 A number of concerts featuring the band have been called off since the videos emerged.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/21/kneecaps-liam-ohanna-charged-after-allegedly-displaying-pro-hezbollah-flag-at-gig">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

 A senior Arab diplomat in London said:“If you asked me a fortnight ago if there will be wider recognition by western states I would have said ‘no’, but now I am not so sure.”<br><br>
 The meetings come after the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, suspended trade talks with Israel on Tuesday and described its refusal to lift a blockade of aid into Gaza as “abominable”.<br><br>
 Lammy spoke to the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, on Wednesday about the barriers blocking aid.<br><br>
 The New York conference is being co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France.<br><br>
 The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, said this week: “We cannot leave the children of Gaza a legacy of violence and hatred. So all this must stop and that’s why we are determined to recognise a Palestinian state.”<br><br>
 But officials in the conference, which is being co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and France, will have to discuss the context for such a recognition. One question is whether there would need to be parallel recognition of Israel by states such as Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, something that is regarded as impossible in the absence of a clear path to a two-state solution.<br><br>
 Israel is adamantly opposed to a two-state solution. The new US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, in an interview in Haarezt newspaper resisted the idea, saying: “I am asking whether there truly needs to be a Palestinian state.”<br><br>
 One of the issue under discussion is whether recognising Palestine would have implications for companies or individuals who trade in the occupied territories.<br><br>
 UK ministers are not expecting to announce further measures in the near future, but neither Jordan nor the UK has ruled out using air drops as was attempted last year.</p><p>MPs are concerned that arms companies may be using the partial nature of the arms export ban imposed last September by the UK to send weaponry to Israel for use in Gaza, in breach of an undertaking by ministers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/21/talks-to-start-on-british-recognition-of-state-of-palestine">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
