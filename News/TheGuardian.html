Few details have leaked ahead of the announcement, which will mark the first substantive look at how Carney plans to avoid a recession while locked in a trade war with the US, Canada’s biggest economic partner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/canada-budget-sacrifice-recession">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
