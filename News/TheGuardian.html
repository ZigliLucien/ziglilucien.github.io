The share price jumped by 7%.</strong></p><p><strong>John Moore</strong>, senior investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said:</p><p><strong>Greggs</strong> has been going through a tougher period recently, with the shares down around -30% in the year to date. Recent price increases of around 2% suggest the company is trying to right-size in the aftermath of the National Insurance increases, recalibrating its roll out and growth ambitions.</p><p>There are tentative signs that Greggs is making progress in today’s update, with sales continuing to rise, the shop portfolio growing, and expectations for the year unchanged. Slowing growth will still be a concern, as well as the wider question about whether we have reached ‘peak Greggs’ in the UK. Nevertheless, the baker is a resilient and innovative business that has proven its ability to bounce back from tricky times.</p><p>Turning around a super tanker is never an easy task, especially when the company is in the midst of a highly competitive arena, but there are some signs that <strong>Vodafone</strong> is beginning to ring the changes.</p><p>The group had quite simply been fighting fires on too many fronts while dealing with an increasingly onerous debt burden, leading to the need for a significant transformation. What should now emerge from the turnaround is a smaller and less geographically diverse, but more focused operation…</p><p>The UK business is another region which the group is aiming to strengthen, and its planned mega-merger with <strong>Three UK</strong> should complete imminently. The merger should truly change the domestic landscape, while also providing new revenue opportunities at scale as well as cost synergy savings of around £700 million per year on completion. In the meantime, the unit accounts for 19% of group income and saw total revenue growth of 1.9% for the period.</p><p>The most obvious thorn in the group’s size remains the German operation, which is the group’s largest and accounts for 35% of overall service revenue, which declined by 5% for the year. The unit is still suffering from customer losses which were largely attributable to enforced price increases last year, competitive activity elsewhere and the lingering effects of the change to German TV law which resulted in a recontracting of customers, where the previous number of 8.5 million has been reduced to 4.2 million households.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/may/20/china-australia-cut-interest-rates-greggs-sales-improve-mac-cheese-goes-viral-bank-england-huw-pill-business-live">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>

 Vance gave the first American pope a letter from <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and the first lady inviting him. The Chicago-born pope took the letter and put it on his desk and <strong>was heard saying “at some point”</strong>, in the video footage of the meeting provided by Vatican Media.<br><br>
 Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, also gave the Augustinian pope a copy of two of St Augustine’s most seminal works, The City of God and On Christian Doctrine, the vice-president’s office said. Another gift: A Chicago Bears T-shirt with Leo’s name on it.<br><br>
 “As you can probably imagine, people in the United States are extremely excited about you,” Vance told Leo as they exchanged gifts.<br><br>
 Leo gave Vance a bronze sculpture with the words in Italian “Peace is a fragile flower”, and a coffee-table sized picture book of the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace. Leo noted that Francis had chosen not to live in them and added: “And I may live in, but it’s not totally decided.”<br><br>
 Vance led the US delegation to Sunday’s formal mass opening the pontificate of the first American pope. Joining him at the meeting on Monday was secretary of state <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, also a Catholic, Vance spokesperson <strong>Luke Schroeder</strong> said. The two then also met with the Vatican foreign minister, <strong>Archbishop Paul Gallagher</strong>.<br><br>
 “There was an exchange of views on some current international issues, calling for respect for humanitarian law and international law in areas of conflict and for a negotiated solution between the parties involved,” according to a Vatican statement after their meeting.<br><br>
 After greeting Leo briefly at the end of Sunday’s mass, Vance spent the rest of the day in separate meetings, including with Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong>. He also met with European Commission president <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong> and Italy’s premier <strong>Giorgia Meloni</strong>, who said she hoped the trilateral meeting could be a “new beginning”.<br><br>
 In the evening, Meloni spoke by phone with Trump and several other European leaders ahead of Trump’s expected call with Vladimir Putin today, according to a statement from Meloni’s office.</p><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s bid to gut the top US consumer watchdog has left the agency unable to protect consumers amid mounting fears of recession, according to workers.</p><p>And we are on the verge of another major financial crisis, so it’s terrifying. The one thing we were created to do we can’t do – at a time when we’re most needed.</p><p>We have helped millions of people. We have returned billions of dollars. It isn’t the way it has to be that there is nowhere to turn to when a bank or credit card rips you off. That is something everyone is exposed to.
