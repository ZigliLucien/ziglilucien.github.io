In September, Nigel Farage floated a Reform UK policy of ending indefinite leave to remain that critics said would eject hundreds of thousands of people from the country. In October, the Conservatives began talking about deporting large numbers of people previously considered legally settled. Now, the Labour government is preparing to impose radical new limits on whether asylum seekers can ever gain settled status. The Overton window on immigration keeps marching implacably rightwards.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/asylum-and-returns-policy-statement/restoring-order-and-control-a-statement-on-the-governments-asylum-and-returns-policy">a document published by the government</a> yesterday afternoon, the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, described the plans as “the most sweeping asylum reforms in modern times”. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, said that having an asylum system at all depends on “social confidence” that it is “fair, effective and humane”. A lot of Labour MPs look set to disagree with the approach, causing yet another political headache for No 10.</p><p><em><strong>Society </strong></em>| More than two in five sexually active under-18s in the UK have either <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/18/sexually-active-young-people-uk-choking-strangulation-sex">been strangled or strangled someone during sex</a>, research has found, despite the serious dangers of the practice.</p><p><em><strong>Jeffrey Epstein </strong></em>| The Harvard professor and economist Larry Summers said he would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/17/larry-summers-jeffrey-epstein">step back from public life</a> after documents released by the House oversight committee revealed email exchanges between him and Jeffrey Epstein, who called himself Summers’ “wing man”.</p><p><em><strong>Cop30 </strong></em><strong>|</strong> Jamaica has led <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/17/this-is-survival-jamaica-leads-calls-from-vulnerable-nations-at-cop30">calls from vulnerable nations</a> at the Cop30 climate summit to urge immediate action on climate breakdown as the conference entered its second week.</p><p><em><strong>Gaza</strong></em> | The UN security council <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/un-security-council-votes-to-endorse-donald-trumps-gaza-plan">has endorsed proposals</a> put forward by Donald Trump for a lasting peace in Gaza, including the deployment of an international stabilisation force and a possible path to a sovereign Palestinian state.</p><p><em><strong>Poland</strong></em> | Poland’s prime minister Donald Tusk has described an explosion along a section of railway line used for deliveries to Ukraine as an “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/17/poland-railway-blast-was-unprecedented-act-of-sabotage-says-donald-tusk">unprecedented act of sabotage</a>” that could have led to disaster.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/18/tuesday-briefing-what-labour-hopes-to-learn-from-denmarks-hardline-asylum-stance">Continue reading...</a></blockquote></blockquote></div></td></tr>
